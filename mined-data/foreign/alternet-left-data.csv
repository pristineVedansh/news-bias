Bernie Sanders on Monday slammed President Donald Trump for bragging on Twitter about the booming stock market just days after Republican inaction allowed the $600-per-week boost in unemployment benefits to expire, slashing the incomes of nearly 30 million Americans as the economy remains mired in deep recession.
“One hundred fifty thousand coronavirus deaths, 30 million without an unemployment lifeline, five million newly uninsured, 14 million children going hungry,” Sanders tweeted. “But Trump is too busy playing golf and boasting about the stock market. Obscene.”
In a tweet Monday morning, Trump hailed the “record high Nasdaq” and warned “it would all come crashing down, including your Jobs, Stocks, and 401k’s, if Sleepy Joe [Biden] ever became president.”
The president didn’t mention that the jobless rate under his leadership is already at historic highs—last week marked the 19th consecutive week that “unemployment claims have been more than twice the worst week of the Great Recession,” according to the Economic Policy Institute.
“Tweeting this during the worst economic downturn in 70 years, a housing, hunger, and healthcare crisis, and days after extended [unemployment insurance] benefits expired because of the Senate GOP, is both shameful and shameless,” Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) wrote in response to the president’s boast.
Trump’s tweet came as the prospect of a deal between Democratic negotiators and the White House to extend the enhanced unemployment benefits at any level appeared as slim as ever.
The Washington Post reported that with relief talks at an impasse, “the Trump administration is looking at options for unilateral actions it can take to try to address some of the economic fallout caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.”
“It’s not clear what steps the administration could take without the help of Congress on issues such as lapsed enhanced unemployment benefits or the expired moratorium on evictions,” the Post noted.
Many congressional Republicans, meanwhile, have shown little interest in extending the boosted unemployment benefits even as coronavirus cases continue to surge and tens of millions of Americans struggle to afford food and rent.
The American Prospect‘s David Dayen argued Monday that the GOP’s lack of urgency in the middle of worsening public health and economic crises stems from the fact that Republicans already secured the bailout they really wanted in March, when Congress approved a $4.5 trillion “slush fund” for big corporations.
“The suffering on Wall Street has been lifted,” Dayen wrote. “On the day that expanded unemployment benefits expired last Friday, the stock market rose. It’s back up again today. As we know, this is the cause of an ironclad vow from the Federal Reserve to do whatever it takes to protect asset prices, and a $4.5 trillion money cannon facilitated by Congress to back up the promise.”
“The corporate bailout was the rescue Republicans wanted,” Dayen added. “It was valuable to them and they were willing to give up a lot to get it. Democrats secured some pretty good terms but they were all temporary, and now they’ve mostly expired. The Fed money cannon, you will note, has not.”

Ten years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration is now asking the Supreme Court to overturn it. Yet it’s now clear that the ACA has brought significant improvements to the lives of millions of Americans. Today, they enjoy more health care coverage, with greater access, better outcomes and less cost.
One segment in particular gained the most: pre-Medicare adults from ages 50 to 64. Before the ACA, the number of uninsured in that group reached 8.9 million people. Insurance companies rejected more than one in five of their applications. Those who remained uninsured received fewer basic clinical services. They were more likely to experience health declines.
But after passage of the ACA, 5.6 million of them – 9% of the 62 million in the pre-Medicare group – purchased coverage in the individual health insurance market. As a result, their uninsured rate fell from over 14% in 2013 to less than 9% in 2018.
Now the new question: Have there been improvements in the health status for the pre-Medicare population? If so, they would likely be somewhat more resilient to COVID-19. So both of us began to analyze data from the Health and Retirement Study, and tracked changes in the group’s well-being. We chose the years 2010 and 2016.
Data shows health improvements
What we found was good news. On balance, middle-aged Americans are better off now than before passage of the ACA. Key health metrics improved. Reported levels of depression are down. Smoking has declined. Those who say their health improved over the prior two years rose from 12% to 16%. The number who say their health had deteriorated has diminished.
What’s more, their use of hospitals and nursing homes over the period has lessened. Given the high pandemic-related mortality rate among residents of nursing homes, this is a particularly critical finding.
To put it into perspective: the two-year incidence rate for the group’s nursing home admission in the pre-ACA (1.7%) and post-ACA (0.7%) period is a drop of 59%. Annually, that translates to 284,000 fewer admissions.
And far fewer deaths: Some estimates suggest that ultimately, upwards of 20% of nursing home residents may die from COVID-19.
So assume that roughly 15% of new admissions from this population are particularly frail and vulnerable and end up as residents with greater than two-year stays. This annual reduction in admissions would mean up to roughly 8,500 fewer deaths per year.
We also found that out-of-pocket medical costs for them was reduced by 11%, even though medical inflation increased by more than 25% during the period. Fewer of them retired involuntarily – noteworthy, because declining health is a primary reason those between ages 50 and 64 leave the workforce. And fewer were living below the federal poverty line.
Lower risk, better outcomes
So what does this mean in the context of COVID-19?
The pre-Medicare group is now at somewhat lower risk of a severe outcome due to the pandemic. With less use of hospitals and nursing homes, and more staying at home, they have reduced their risk.
[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]
With greater access to insurance, and lower out-of-pocket expenses, they are less likely to put off early treatment; cost is no longer a significant barrier. And because employment is no longer tied directly to health coverage, they may feel less pressure to work when they are ill.
Social isolation can be problematic for those middle-aged and older, who often are lacking social support resources. The decreased rates of depression among the group is likely due to greater access to mental health services. Clearly, this helps mitigate the negative effects of the stay-at-home orders and the anxiety of a pandemic.
Our findings suggest a continued need, not only to safeguard the ACA, but to strengthen it – and keep millions of vulnerable Americans safe and healthy. The Trump administration’s move to overturn the ACA, particularly during this extraordinary time, will only add to our current challenges.

0,2020-08-04T01:08:21+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/republican-senators-are-committing-political/,Republican senators are committing political suicide,"Be thankful for small favors.
When the Covid-19 depression hit like a brick, almost no one advocated austerity as a cure. For the first time since Richard Nixon proclaimed that we are all Keynesians, budget deficits and a burgeoning national debt were accepted as crucial to mitigate the extent and damage of the ongoing depression. Today that history may seem unexceptional, but faith in the doctrine if not the practice of fiscal austerity has been one of the pillars of US capitalism.
Perhaps the classic defense of austerity is Andrew Mellon’s Depression-era defense of austerity at all costs. In his memoirs, President Hoover wrote that Mellon advised him to “liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate.” Though President Hoover had less sanguinary views he ended up taking the hit for the Great Depression. Nonetheless, faith in balanced budgets survived the periodically even within the New Deal. Franklin Roosevelt never became a Keynesian and a 1937 return to fiscal solvency brought another round of growing unemployment.
More recent experience confirms worries about fiscal tightening. Barack Obama came into office at the inception of the world financial crisis. Unlike today, there was almost unanimous Republican opposition to this stimulus package. He tweaked and reduced that package in order to gain some Republican support. The effort failed politically and the undersized package fueled an anemic recovery
The Eurozone was also at the center of the world financial crisis. It suffered even more than the U.S. University of Texas at Austin economist James Galbraith points out that Eurozone rules requiring attempts to balance the budget impose even harsher austerity on member states and were the cause of a very slow and painful recovery in Europe.
I suspect that even many Republican economists would accept at least some of this analysis. This brings up the question of why they would insist on substantial reductions in the supplemental unemployment insurance program. I would argue that reductions in that program will not only lead to more unemployment but risks a further downward spiral in the economy. That $600 a week was someone else’s future income. Furthermore if the loss of the full $600 dollars does lead some unemployed to enter the labor market, mean wages and hence consumer power will sink.
Workers who do choose to continue their job searches are entering a labor market already showing record level weakness even before the Republican cuts take effect. Commerce Department announced that “the U.S. economy shrank at a record-shattering 32.9% annual rate last quarter. New Labor Department numbers also out Thursday showed that 1.43 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total number of people in the U.S. who are either receiving unemployment insurance (UI) or waiting for approval to more than 33 million.”
In any case evidence suggests that current recipients of the bonus do not give up looking for jobs. “The data do not show a relationship between benefit generosity and employment paths after the CARES Act, which could be due to the collapse of labor demand during the Covid-19 crisis,” said co-author and Yale economics professor Joseph Altonji.
The Chicago Federal Reserve found a similar trend, according to recent reporting by Common Dreams, “Those currently collecting benefits search more than twice as intensely as those who have exhausted their benefits.”
Republicans seem not to consider that for many workers a job is more than just a way of making money—especially if the workplace is organized to value their contributions.
According to conventional political science, in presidential elections citizens usually vote based on the direction of the economy in the months leading up to the election. Why Republicans would insist on proposals that could only exacerbate the current depression is a mystery to me. I would expect the harsh austerity bath once the election is behind us.
Perhaps showing workers how precious their jobs are and who is the boss is of paramount importance. Let’s make them pay with an election loss and job creation policies that address the health and climate issues that only affirmative government can handle.

Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, called out President Donald Trump after her father tested positive for COVID-19 last week.
Gohmert had refused to wear a mask for months before contracting the disease. After testing positive, he attempted to claim that he got sick by incorrectly wearing a mask.
Gohmert’s daughter, Caroline Brooks, posted a statement on Twitter urging people to wear masks after her father’s diagnosis.
“Wearing a mask is a non-partisan issue,” Brooks, who is a musician, posted under her stage name BELLSAINT. “The advice of medical experts shouldn’t be politicized. My father ignored medical expertise and now he has COVID.”
Brooks said it has been a “heartbreaking battle,” because “I love my dad and don’t want him to die.”
She appeared to blame Trump for her father’s refusal to listen to doctors.
“Please listen to medical experts,” she wrote. “It’s not worth following a president who has no remorse for leading his followers to an early grave.”
Gohmert has rejected any semblance of medical advice. In addition to blaming masks for his infection, he claimed to be taking the unproven drug treatment of hydroxychloroquine.
“It is what was decided as the best course of action between my doctor and me–not by government bureaucrats,” Gohmert wrote on Twitter last week.
The Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency authorization for hydroxychloroquine after studies repeatedly showed it was not effective in treating the coronavirus and was linked to serious side effects.
Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, told NBC News on Sunday that doctors should not prescribe the drug to treat the virus.
“There may be circumstances — I don’t know what they are — where a physician may prescribe it for an individual, but I think most physicians and prescribers are evidence-based and they’re not influenced by whatever is on Twitter or anything else,” he said. “And the evidence just doesn’t show that hydroxychloroquine is effective, for now. I think we need to move on from that and talk about what is effective.”
Gohmert’s infection, which was announced a day after he participated in a televised House Judiciary hearing with Attorney General Bill Barr and ahead of a planned meeting with Trump, prompted Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to announce new rules requiring masks to be worn on the chamber floor.
Several members of Congress were forced to self-quarantine after Gohmert’s announcement.
But the damage may have already been done. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday after chairing a hearing which included Gohmert.
“While I cannot blame anyone directly for this, this week has shown that there are some members of Congress who fail to take this crisis seriously,” he said in a statement. “Numerous Republican members routinely strut around the Capitol without a mask to selfishly make a political statement at the expense of their colleagues, staff and their families.”

0,2020-08-03T23:47:06+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trumps-s-on-the-postal-service-are-hurting-democracy-and-thats-the-point/,Trump’s attacks on the Postal Service are hurting democracy — and that’s the point,"Donald Trump continues to both demonize the idea of vote by mail and dismantle the U.S. Postal Service, and it’s making a predictable mess. The House Oversight and Reform Committee is calling new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to testify about changes to the Postal Service, but they’re letting that testimony wait until September 17, because apparently this isn’t super urgent, even though “While these changes in a normal year would be drastic, in a presidential election year when many states are relying heavily on absentee mail-in ballots, increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner—an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election,” as committee Chair Carolyn Maloney wrote to DeJoy.
But while the concrete damage Trump is doing to the on-time delivery of mail in this country is a disaster, the effects of his constant ranting against mail voting on his fellow Republicans are kind of hilarious. Because the thing is, more Republicans than Democrats traditionally mail in their ballots … or did, until Trump went to work.
Local Republican Party organizations and officials are desperately trying to reassure their voters that it’s okay to vote by mail.
“Please don’t confuse North Carolina’s absentee system with other states’ all-mail elections,” the Johnston County, North Carolina, Republican Party told supporters on Facebook. “NCGOP and JoCo GOP agrees with the President that our current absentee ballot request system is safe and secure.” But a vocal fraction of commenters were not having it, because it is now no longer The Republican Way to vote by mail, even in a pandemic.
At a recent meeting with Republicans, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill found confusion that can be directly traced to Trump’s efforts to distinguish voting by mail, which is bad, from absentee voting by mail, which he does and is therefore good. “They were confused about two different kinds of mail-in balloting,” Merrill told The Washington Post, “where one is ‘good’ and one is not.”
But don’t look for the concerns of local Republicans to sway Trump. He has something more important in mind: his own interests. “Some advisers acknowledged privately that the president may be laying the groundwork to claim the election was rigged if he loses in November,” the Post reports.
Both polls and early ballot requests show that Democrats are eager to mail in their ballots while Republicans are opposed. Will the determination to vote in person no matter what because Trump said so be enough to put Republican voters in long lines on Election Day, an experience more typically reserved for voters of color and low-income voters? Will it reduce overall Republican turnout? If we weren’t worried about the Postal Service having the resources and management needed to get ballots to election officials on schedule, the Republican dilemma might almost be funny, given that it’s so fully self-created. As it is, though, Trump is every day laying waste to the legitimacy of this election and of U.S. democracy more generally.

0,2020-08-03T23:18:45+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/democrats-have-a-warning-for-the-gop-if-it-tries-to-put-another-trump-appointee-on-the-supreme-court/,Democrats have a warning for the GOP if it tries to put another Trump appointee on the Supreme Court,"When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February of 2016, Senate Republicans discovered a heretofore unidentified, now-infamous caveat to President Barack Obama’s constitutional powers: Black presidents aren’t allowed to fill vacant Supreme Court seats during an election year. The Senate refused to even consider the nomination of Merrick Garland, who was put forward by Obama for the role; instead, the seat was simply left vacant for the duration of Obama’s term. When Republican Trump was installed as president the next year, the Senate swiftly confirmed his own conservative nominee.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and fawning Trump golf partner Sen. Lindsey Graham, among others, have not been shy in declaring that the previously made-up rule no longer applies under Trump. On the contrary, they say the Senate would move swiftly to confirm any last-minute nominees if a vacancy were to arise in the last months of Trump’s calamitous term. The recent diagnosis of liberal court icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with liver cancer (she is by all accounts being successfully treated) is putting new focus on these Republican court-packing inventions and un-inventions—and is pushing Democratic senators to more seriously consider expanding the court to rebalance it in the face of blatant Republican sabotages.
Whether Democratic senators will have the guts to actually do the thing remains an open question. But Sen. Tim Kaine—not exactly a liberal firebreather—is among those now open to expanding the Supreme Court if McConnell, Graham, and the others are insistent on undoing their own supposed ban on election-year nominees, notes NBC:
“If they show that they’re unwilling to respect precedent, rules and history, then they can’t feign surprise when others talk about using a statutory option that we have that’s fully constitutional in our availability.”
Unfortunately, that is phrased as a threat that depends on if Republicans go any further than they already have, rather than an observation about just how far they have already gone. The Democratic National Committee may go farther; they’re planning to make a call for “structural” court reforms part of the party platform.
The current Supreme Court has lost its legitimacy, and for structural rather than ideological reasons. The blocking of an Obama justice under a newly invented partisan rule that was discarded immediately afterwards put Neil Gorsuch on the court illegitimately; the Republican Senate’s role in hiding evidence during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings was a near-perfect runup to the fiasco of discarded impeachment charges against Trump, not because anyone was willing to argue that Trump did not do the political extortion he was charged with but because Republican senators declared they simply did not wish to hear any evidence either way. The court is a product of the same Republican corruption that has debased the rest of Washington, and the nation. The party broke it.
“It would be very dangerous for Americans to begin to believe the Supreme Court was not the legitimate arbiter of our nation’s laws,” we often hear. True, but that ship has sailed. The Supreme Court is a parody of itself already; you cannot even make good money making bets as to which conservative justices will discard their own precedents and proclamations to bend each new argument towards the preferred “conservative” outcome, because everybody else also knows that the core of conservative justices will make those flips of logic whenever the need arises. Pointing it out is now a consistent feature—and perhaps the most consistent feature—of non-conservative dissents.
It is true that Trump replacing any Supreme Court position in the next few months would quickly blossom into yet another crisis of government as the Senate swiftly erased whatever self-declared impediments were thrown up in the past, the whole of America watched it happen, and a good chunk of America came to the conclusion that the Supreme Court was now simply a structural appendage of the Republican Party. Again, though: ship, sailed. Watching the Kavanaugh nomination and listening to McConnell’s unending carousel of new-rules-that-are-not, does anyone think the Supreme Court is not that appendage right now?

Nevertheless, the president has continued to behave just as he promised he would in March when there had been only 40 deaths from the virus here and he said, “I don’t take responsibility at all.”
In April, when 50,000 Americans had died, he praised himself and his administration, insisting, “I think we’ve done a great job.” In May, as deaths continued to mount nationwide, he insisted, “We have met the moment and we have prevailed.” In June, he swore the virus was “dying out,” contradicting the views and data of his just-swept-into-the-closet coronavirus task force. In July, he cast the blame for the ongoing disaster on state governors, who, he told the nation, had handled the virus “poorly,” adding, “I supplied everybody.” It was the governors, he assured the public, who had failed to acquire and distribute key supplies, including protective gear and testing supplies.
All told, he’s been a perfect model in deflecting all responsibility, even as the death toll soared over 150,000 with more than four million cases reported nationwide and no end in sight, even as he assured the coronavirus of a splendid future in the U.S. by insisting that all schools reopen this fall (and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention back him on that).
In other words, Donald Trump and his team have given lack of accountability a new meaning in America. Their refusal to accept the slightest responsibility for Covid-19’s rampage through this country may seem startling (or simply like our new reality) in a land that has traditionally defined itself as dedicated to democratic governance, and the rule of law. It has long seen itself as committed to transparency and justice, through investigations, reports, and checks and balances, notably via the courts and Congress, designed to ensure that its politicians and officials be held responsible for their actions. The essence of democracy — the election — was also the essence of accountability, something whose results Donald Trump recently tried to throw into doubt when it comes to the contest this November.
Still, the loss of accountability isn’t simply a phenomenon of the Trump years. Its erosion has been coming for a long time at what, in retrospect, should seem an alarmingly inexorable pace.
In August 2020, it should be obvious that America, a still titanic (if fading) power, has largely thrown accountability overboard. With that in mind, here’s a little history of how it happened.
The War on Terror
As contemporary historians and political analysts tell it, the decision to go to war in Iraq in the spring of 2003, which cost more than 8,000 American lives and led to more than 200,000 Iraqi deaths, military and civilian, was more than avoidable. It was the result of lies and doctored information engineered to get the U.S. involved in a crucial part of what would soon enough become its “forever wars” across the Greater Middle East and Africa.
As Robert Draper recently reminded us, those in the administration of President George W. Bush who contested information about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq were ignored or silenced. Worse yet, torture was used to extract a false confession from senior al-Qaeda member Ibn Sheikh al-Libi regarding the terror organization’s supposed attempts to acquire such weaponry there. Al-Libi’s testimony, later recanted, was used as yet another pretext to launch an invasion that top American officials had long been determined to set in motion.
And it wasn’t just a deceitful decision. It was a thoroughly disastrous one as well. There is today something like a consensus among policy analysts that it was possibly the “biggest mistake in American military history” or, as former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) put it four years after the invasion, “the worst foreign policy mistake in U.S. history,” supplanting the Vietnam War in the minds of many.
And that raises an obvious question: Who was held accountable for that still unending disaster? Who was charged with the crime of willfully and intentionally taking the nation to war — and a failed war at that — based on manufactured facts? In numerous books, the grim realities of that moment have been laid out clearly. When it comes to any kind of public censure, or trial, or even an official statement of wrongdoing, none was ever forthcoming.
Nor was there any accountability for the policy and practice of torture, “legally” sanctioned then, that took the country back to practices more common in the Middle Ages. (It’s worth noting as well that John Yoo, who wrote the memos authorizing such torture then, is now helping the Trump administration find ways to continue evading checks on the presidency.)
More than a decade ago at TomDispatch, I wrote about how the Bush administration supported such acts at the highest levels. As a result, in the early years of the war on terror, in 20 CIA “black sites,” located in eight countries, the U.S. government used torture, as a Senate Select Intelligence Committee Report of December 2014 would detail, to elicit information and misinformation from dozens of “high-value detainees.”
It should go without saying that torture violates just about every precept of the modern rule of law: the renunciation of adjudication in favor of brutality, the use of dungeon-like chambers and medieval equipment rather than the expertise of intelligence professionals gathering information, and of course the rejection of any conviction that civility and rights are valuable.
Among his first acts on entering the Oval Office, Barack Obama pledged that the United States under his leadership would “not torture.” Nonetheless, the lawyers who wrote the memos legally approving those policies were never held accountable, nor were the Bush administration officials who signed off on them (and had such techniques demonstrated to them in the White House); nor, of course, were the actual torturers and the doctors who advised them in any way censured or criminally charged in American courts.
Indeed, many of their careers only advanced as they took jobs like a federal judge, a professor at a prestigious law school, or a well-remunerated author. When suggestions for leveling criminal charges or holding congressional hearings and investigations were raised, the Obama administration decided not to proceed. Attorney General Eric Holder claimed that “the admissible evidence would not be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt,” while President Obama insisted that the administration should “look forward as opposed to looking backwards.” Accountability was once again abandoned.
And looming over the war on terror, the invasion of Iraq, and those torture policies was a refusal to hold any agency, administration, or anyone at all responsible for failing to stop 9/11 from happening in the first place. The 9/11 Commission Report might have been an initial step in that process, but as journalist Philip Shenon put it in his book The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation, the report “skirt[ed] judgements about people who almost certainly had some blame for failing to prevent September 11.”
Evasion Elsewhere
It wasn’t only in relation to the war on terror that accountability vanished. The government responded to the 2007-2008 banking crisis with a similar determination to avoid it. At that time, the men who ran the nation’s largest banks had played upon the greed of investors to leverage mortgage investments until, lacking government bailouts, their companies would have gone under. In response, both the Bush and Obama administrations bandaged the losses with federal funds. Yet when it came to a classic dive into irresponsible and even illegal financial behavior, they offered stern warnings and nothing else.
Accountability had been similarly elusive for corporate crimes for decades. Take, for instance, the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill that covered 1,300 miles of Alaskan coastline with oil, while killing thousands of birds, otters, seals, and whales. Lawsuits brought by that state did result in payments of more than $1 billion after the federal government indicted ExxonMobil for violating the Clean Water Act. However, only the captain of the ship, whom many experts felt had been scapegoated, was convicted of a criminal offense.
A separate lawsuit filed on behalf of local fishermen, native Alaskans, and landowners fared less well. In our post-9/11 era of unaccountability, the penalties that had been leveled against the oil company were reconsidered. In 2008, the Supreme Court reduced a $5 billion punitive damages award by 89% to $507.5 million dollars. And in 2017, in the early months of the Trump administration, 26 years of litigation came to an abrupt end when a federal court in Alaska decided not to pursue a final ExxonMobil payment of $100 million for damages from the spill.
As it turns out, (lack of) accountability is increasingly not just a matter of the law but of politics, as the Mueller investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election of 2016 highlighted. No matter how much information Mueller and his team collected demonstrating violations of both law and policy in future president Donald Trump’s dealings with Russia, or how much information a series of career diplomats and national security officials provided on his quid pro quo approach to Ukrainian officials, escaping blame, not to mention impeachment, has proven all too easy for the president.
As Attorney General Barr told the nation, misrepresenting the essence of the Mueller report, the investigation “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.” More accurately, the report concluded that the evidence “does not exonerate” the president.
Subsequently, nine individuals, seven of them members of the Trump team, were found guilty and 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies were indicted (though charges against two of the companies have been dropped by Barr’s Department of Justice). And while five of those convicted went to jail, Donald Trump commuted the sentence of his close associate Roger Stone. Meanwhile, the prosecution of his first National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is still in turmoil after the Department of Justice directed and a federal appeals court ordered the case to be dropped. As the Flynn episode demonstrates, even when individuals were held accountable, the president and his administration have, in essence, refused to accept the judgments of the courts.
In other words, the mechanisms for shining a light on government wrongdoing are being systematically undermined and abolished. In that spirit, in April and May at the behest of the president, numerous inspectors general, tasked by law with investigating and reporting on wrongdoing in their agencies, were fired, including those for the State Department and the Intelligence Community, as well as the acting inspectors general for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Transportation.
In the age of Trump we’re reaching the end of the line when it comes to accountability in the halls of government. Increasingly, it’s no longer an American concept.
Once Upon a Time
It hasn’t always been this way. In the past, when government policy or the officials making it have gone rogue, broken the law, and conspired against the basic tenets of American democracy, they have, at times, paid the price. Nearly a century ago, for instance, President Warren Harding’s Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall went to prison for accepting bribes from oil companies in the Teapot Dome Scandal. In fact, the list of former government officials who have been convicted and served time in jail is long.
Fifty years later, in the Watergate scandal of Richard Nixon’s presidency, 69 individuals, including several top government officials, were indicted and 48 of them found guilty of burglarizing documents from and wiretapping Democratic Party headquarters, among other things. The trail of illegality and cover-up went right up to the office of the president, ending in impeachment proceedings, which led President Nixon to resign.
During the years of Ronald Reagan’s presidency, misuse of power was punished as well. Fourteen people in or close to his administration were convicted for their participation in the Iran-Contra scandal in which the government secretly sold weapons to Iran, an act proscribed by law, with plans to use the funds from those sales to support American-backed Contra rebels in Nicaragua (also in violation of U.S. law). True, of the 14 charged and 11 convicted, only one actually served his sentence in prison. Nonetheless, the convictions stood as a testament to a public acknowledgement of governmental wrongdoing.
Perhaps the saddest part of all is that the Trump administration has not just refused to take responsibility for anything whatsoever, but has blamed others, even those on the front lines of pandemic defense, for things that it did. Since Covid-19 struck American shores and the president and his officials failed to respond, resulting in a catastrophically high — and climbing — death toll, accountability has been harnessed to political whims in a new way. The president has, for instance, blamed President Obama whose pandemic office was dismantled by Trump’s own national security advisor John Bolton.
Until recently, President Trump refused to wear a mask in public and insisted — until belatedly canceling the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida, still rife with the pandemic — on holding a maskless, unsocial-distanced indoor rally in Tulsa despite overwhelming evidence that indoor transmission is the predominant means by which Covid-19 spreads. In doing so, he also encouraged irresponsible behavior at a local level, while supporting governors ready to imprudently reopen their state economies far too quickly and so condemn Americans there to an explosion of new cases.
It’s possible that this abdication of leadership, leading to a disastrously rising death rate, will, in the end, help Americans turn the corner from unaccountability to accountability — and not just for the disastrous Covid-19 response. Recent street protests from Portland to Manhattan, Chicago to Kansas City, are a sign that accountability is long overdue, not just for the current era, but for this century of American life.
In March, journalist Peter Bergen was the first person to call for a 9/11-style commission to investigate the government’s response to the coronavirus, “if only to make sure the nation is prepared for the next pandemic.” Recently, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, both from California, also proposed a Covid-19 Commission “not as a political exercise to cast blame, but to learn from our mistakes so we can prevent the problems we now face from being tragically repeated… An honest analysis is the only way to adequately prepare for the next novel virus or another disaster.”
Of course, no such thing is imaginable until Donald Trump is out of office and the Senate in Democratic hands, which does look possible. In the meantime, in its own deadly fashion, the pandemic crisis may actually help turn the tide and bring accountability back to American shores. If more than 150,000 deaths, countless numbers of them preventable, don’t offer a compelling reason to hold our public officials responsible, then what would?
Whatever the punishments, however symbolic or cosmetic, crimes of this sort need to be exposed for what they are and those who carried them out officially identified and held to account. This has nothing to do with retribution. It is not about exacting punishment. It’s about shining a beam of light on deeds that have been harmful beyond imagination and must never be repeated. We as a nation need to remind ourselves of what morality, justice, and the responsible use of power can mean. The country has to be given a chance to restore its long-faded commitment to accountable government. And perhaps we should acknowledge one more crucial thing: that this may prove to be our last chance.

0,2020-08-03T22:29:05+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/health-experts-warn-about-political-interference-in-vaccines-as-trump-urges-warp-speed/,Health experts warn about political interference in vaccines as Trump urges ‘warp speed’,"Public health experts on Monday raised alarm over the White House’s aggressive push to rush a Covid-19 vaccine into production, an effort which critics say has been apparent since the first weeks of the pandemic.
According to a New York Times report, researchers working on Operation Warp Speed, the public-private partnership established to find a vaccine that could be given to the public within the next few months, are “under constant pressure from a White House anxious for good news.”
When the task force was first assembled in April, weeks after the pandemic began and when President Donald Trump was insisting to the public that the coronavirus would likely disappear on its own, the Health and Human Services Department shared a presentation with the White House saying October 2020 should be a firm “deadline” for developing a vaccine and giving “broad access to the public.”
The Trump administration has since begun promoting late 2020 or early 2021 as the timeframe for a Covid-19 vaccine, but public health officials are concerned that the president’s desire to win re-election may interfere with scientists’ efforts to ensure a vaccine is safe and effective before it is approved for use by the public.
With Trump campaign officials reportedly calling a potential pre-election vaccine “the holy grail,” experts told the Times of their concern that Trump will pressure the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve whichever vaccine is furthest along in the clinical trial process in the weeks before the general election on November 3.
“There are a lot of people on the inside of this process who are very nervous about whether the administration is going to reach their hand into the Warp Speed bucket, pull out one or two or three vaccines, and say, ‘We’ve tested it on a few thousand people, it looks safe, and now we are going to roll it out,'” Dr. Paul A. Offit of the University of Pennsylvania, who serves on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, told the Times.
Presidential adviser Jared Kushner, who is helping to lead Trump’s reelection campaign and influenced the decision to name Dr. Moncef Slaoui as chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed, is reportedly in regular contact with public health officials to speed up the development of a vaccine.
“Researchers are fearful of political intervention in the coming months and are struggling to ensure that the government maintains the right balance between speed and rigorous regulation,” the Times reported.
The pressure campaign from the White House has led companies researching vaccines to begin manufacturing millions of doses of the immunization, “essentially on spec so that they can be distributed quickly if they secure approval.”
The newspaper’s report came a day after Dr. Steven Salzberg, a biomedical engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University, suggested in a Forbes op-ed that vaccines which have entered Phase 3 of their clinical trials, the final step in pharmaceutical testing before approval, should be offered more widely to the public at a faster pace:
We already have two vaccines in phase 3 trials in the U.S. and Europe; each of these trials which will vaccinate many thousands of people, and then wait to see how many get infected… But we don’t have to wait. Both of these vaccines (from Moderna and Oxford University/Astra Zeneca) have already been shown, in phase 1 trials, to be safe and probably effective. That’s why the companies are moving ahead and giving each vaccine to 30,000 more people: they are fairly confident that the vaccines are safe…So why not start administering millions of doses right now?
Others in the science and public health communities were distraught over Salzberg’s suggestion, taking to social media on Sunday to explain why rushing to administer vaccines to millions of people before clinical trials have been completed is, as one science journalist tweeted, “a horrifically bad idea.”
“Drug trials exist for a reason. So many things can go wrong,” wrote Erin Biba. “If you skip the checks and balances the amount of damage that can be done is astronomical.”
Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett derided Salzberg’s piece as an “utterly bonkers, insane, irresponsible article,” while University of Florida biostatistics professor Natalie Dean laid out the dangers of offering a vaccine to the public before its efficacy and safety is proven via the painstaking process of completed clinical trials.
Widespread use of an unproven vaccine:
– Gives people a false sense of security if efficacy is really low
– Diverts resources away from other interventions (fixing testing!)
– Makes it harder to evaluate better vaccines
– Jeopardizes safety
– Erodes trust in the process
— Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) August 2, 2020
In an op-ed at the Times on Monday, Dean questioned the very notion of developing a vaccine for a newly-discovered virus at “warp speed.”
Dean noted that in a survey taken by AP-NORC in May, 31% of respondents said they were unsure whether they would get a coronavirus vaccine once one is made available, in a display of the “vaccine hesitancy” which the World Health Organization says could jeopardize the global community’s ability to combat the pandemic.
“This hesitancy isn’t surprising. Why should we expect Americans to agree to a vaccine before one is even available?” wrote Dean. “I’m a vaccine researcher, and even I would place myself in the ‘not sure’ bucket… The evidence that would convince me to get a Covid-19 vaccine, or to recommend that my loved ones get vaccinated, does not yet exist.”
That data can only be gathered through a complete Phase 3 trial of a vaccine, Dean wrote, showing that a vaccine either provides immunity to Covid-19 or, like the flu vaccine, keeps patients from developing severe symptoms of the illness if they contract it.
Although the public’s desperation for a Covid-19 vaccine is understandable, Dean wrote, “a weak vaccine might be worse than no vaccine at all. We do not want people who are only slightly protected to behave as if they are invulnerable, which could exacerbate transmission.”
“It is also costly to roll out a vaccine, diverting attention away from other efforts that we know work, like mask-wearing, and from testing better vaccines,” she added.
Following the backlash against his article, Salzberg on Monday wrote an update to the Forbes piece, titled “I Was Wrong: We Can’t Skip Phase 3 Vaccine Trials.”
“If we expand the distribution of vaccines too quickly, and then the vaccine doesn’t work, we may seriously undermine the public’s trust in any eventual vaccine that really does work,” Salzberg wrote. “That in turn will reduce the number of people willing to be vaccinated, which could cause serious harm to public health.”
The Trump administration, the researchers who are under pressure from the White House, and the public must “resist the desire” to push for a rushed vaccine by the election, early 2021, or any specific date, Dean suggested.
“Creating vaccines is hard, and we should be prepared for the reality that some promising ones will not meet the F.D.A.’s criteria,” she continued. “Researchers and the government should also commit to transparency so that people can see the results for themselves to understand the regulatory decisions. Waiting for a better vaccine to come along may feel like torture, but it is the right move. With so many potential shots on goal, scientists are optimistic that a safe and effective vaccine is out there. We can’t afford to jeopardize the public’s health and hard-earned trust by approving anything short of that.”

In the video, the handler could be seen wearing a Kaepernick jersey as dogs attacked him for demonstration purposes at an event held by the nonprofit National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum. “Oh man, I will stand,” the handler could be heard saying after the dog attack. The comment, a reference to  Kaepernick’s earlier decision to kneel for social justice during the playing of the national anthem at NFL games, earned him a few laughs from the crowd, but the Navy was not amused.
“The inherent message of this video is completely inconsistent with the values and ethos of Naval Special Warfare and the U.S. Navy,” a Navy spokesperson said in a statement about the incident. “We are investigating the matter fully, and initial indications are that there were no active duty Navy personnel or equipment involved with this independent organization’s event.”

When Kaepernick, who was then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, took a knee during the national anthem four years ago, he was all but banned from the NFL and targeted with threats and profanities. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell recently did an about-face in light of protests throughout the nation following the death of George Floyd. A Black man, Floyd died in police custody May 25 after a Minneapolis cop kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. “We were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,” Goodell has since said.
Far be it for President Donald Trump to follow suit, though. He implied Kaepernick was a “son of a b—h” at an Alabama rally for Republican Sen. Luther Strange in September 2017, and he stood by his stance this year following Floyd’s death.
Tony Fauci has nothing to do with NFL Football. They are planning a very safe and controlled opening. However, if they don’t stand for our National Anthem and our Great American Flag, I won’t be watching!!!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2020

Trump said June 19 that if the NFL doesn’t “stand for our National Anthem and our Great American Flag, I won’t be watching!!!” It’s no mystery why people, even those representing powerful agencies, feel so emboldened to live out their cherished racist sentiments. The SEAL museum has failed to address the anti-Kaepernick videos in a public statement.
In another video, after “Navy SEALs and Navy SEAL dogs take down Colin Kaepernick for not standing during National Anthem,” he moans something like, “Oh man, I will stand” #BecauseFlorida https://t.co/uZ3ervZguB pic.twitter.com/6vi1uCGIt5

Although it isn’t officially affiliated with the Navy SEALs, the museum has several retired SEALs on its board of directors and has apparently been mocking Kaepernick for years, ABC News reported. Another video taken in November 2018 at the museum’s 33rd Annual Muster event shows an SUV with the words “TAKE A KNEE” and “NIKE” on it being used as a shooting target following the corporation’s decision to use Kaepernick in an ad.

0,2020-08-03T20:39:34+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/the-one-thing-we-know-about-bidens-vp-choice/,The one thing we know about Biden’s VP choice,"Apart from the daily outrages of Trump and his enablers, the hot political story these days is the countdown to Biden’s announcement of his running mate. As a reminder, here are the guidelines the candidate laid out for his selection process. His choice for vice president will be:
a woman,
able to step into the job of being president from day one,
someone who agrees with him in principle and philosophically,
someone who can make up for his weaknesses,
someone he can trust, and
someone who will tell him the truth, but will always have his back.
What is clear from that list is that, other than the gender of the candidate, the most important thing for Biden is to replicate—as close as possible—his relationship with Barack Obama.
As we view all of the commentary leading up to this announcement, it is important to keep in mind that most of the arguments being made in favor of one candidate or against another are meaningless. For example, as Christopher Devine and Kyle Kopko documented, “running mates usually fail to deliver votes among targeted geographic or demographic groups.”
Other than being made in the midst of a pandemic, there is one factor in this process that sets it apart from historical precedents. The number one item on the list up above has limited the discussion to various women candidates. As such, we’re hearing some arguments that have never surfaced in the past when it was assumed that the nominee would be a man. For example, I don’t remember vice presidential candidates being criticized for being too ambitious or wanting to run for president someday. In most instances, those things were assumed, indicating that this is the kind of critique that is only leveled against women.
The truth is that, among the women who are rumored to be under consideration, any one of them would be an impressive choice. It seems that in politics these days, we actually have to point out that none of them is perfect, even though that has never been true of any human being on the planet. But it is hard to imagine any one of these women being the kind of colossal failure we all witnessed when John McCain chose Sarah Palin.
As the old saying goes, Biden actually has an “embarrassment of riches” when it comes to choosing just one of these women to be his running mate—which is something Democrats should keep in mind when/if their preferred woman isn’t chosen. That’s because the biggest challenge a new administration will face is to clean up the horrendous mess left by the Trump administration. Biden’s cabinet will be at least as important as his vice president. So there will be a critical job for everyone on the list.
As we await Biden’s announcement, there is one thing we know about his choice. The initial reaction from Trump and his enablers will be to attack her with everything they’ve got. The idea that any one of them will be an easier target or a safe bet is, at best, incredibly naive. Over at Fox News, Liz Peek gave us a preview of how all of that will play out.
Here’s what we do know:  almost certainly Biden will pick a woman of color; he has no choice. He owes his nomination to black voters, and they have demanded a seat at the table.
The short list of potential running mates now includes Sen. Kamala Harris, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice, California Rep. Karen Bass, who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, Florida Rep. Val Demings and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
While all five of these women have impressive bios, all have serious shortcomings and none can possibly perform the heavy lifting that this role will require.
Peek goes through each one of these women’s “shortcomings” only to conclude that when Biden delayed his announcement until next week, it must be because he is dithering.
No wonder Biden is dithering. He is looking for a loyal and like-minded vice president and partner, the VP he was to Barack Obama and Mike Pence has been to President Trump. But he also needs someone to light up the ticket.
Another week will not solve this puzzle.
Trump and his enablers have thrown everything they can think of at Joe Biden, but nothing is sticking. So they’ll do the exact same thing to his vice presidential nominee—with the ultimate aim of suggesting that Biden is weak and an “empty vessel” controlled by those around him. That’s what is coming, regardless of his choice.
But all along, voters have made one thing perfectly clear: this election will not be primarily about Joe Biden or his running mate. Instead, it will be a referendum on the narcissistic, mendacious, incompetent bully who currently occupies the Oval Office. If you think that a choice of running mate by the opposition changes things, Morning Consult has a poll for that.
National GE:
Biden/Grisham 46% (+6)
Trump/Pence 40%
Biden/Duckworth 46% (+6)
Trump/Pence 40%
Biden/Whitmer 46% (+5)
Trump/Pence 41%
Biden/Bass 46% (+5)
Trump/Pence 41%
Biden/Bottoms 46% (+5)
Trump/Pence 41%
Biden/Hassan 45% (+4)
Trump/Pence 41%@MorningConsult/@politico
— Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) July 29, 2020
While some of the potential candidates with less name recognition don’t fare as well in national polling, a margin of error of +/- 2 points indicates that Biden’s choice won’t have much effect.
Presidential elections after one four-year term are often a referendum on the incumbent. That has never been more true than it will be in November. The dynamics of this race have already been set, leaving Biden free to pick the woman who can best help him govern.

0,2020-08-03T20:22:38+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/irregularities-found-in-the-trump-administrations-contract-for-company-used-to-collect-data-report/,‘Irregularities’ found in the Trump administration’s contract for company used to collect coronavirus data: report,"TeleTracking Technologies, a Pittsburg-based company known for developing software that hospitals use to track the status of patients, was awarded a multi-million-dollar contract from President Donald Trump’s administration to collect COVID-19 data from hospitals in the U.S. — and National Public Radio is reporting that it found “irregularities” in the “process” that gave TeleTracking the contract.
According to NPR reporters Dina Temple-Raston and Tim Mak, NPR’s investigation found that “the Department of Health and Human Services initially characterized the contract with TeleTracking as a no-bid contract. When asked about that, HHS said there was a ‘coding error’ and that the contract was actually competitively bid. The process by which HHS awarded the contract is normally used for innovative scientific research, not the building of government databases.”
According to the NPR reporters, Carrie Kroll of the Texas Hospital Association “didn’t give it a second thought” when, in April, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it would be using TeleTracking as an option for collecting data on COVID-19. But she “balked” after “the HHS suddenly announced, in July, that hospitals could no longer report COVID data through the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), but would instead, be required to do so through the HHS-TeleTracking system or their state health departments,” Temple-Raston and Mak explain.
Temple-Raston and Mak note that NPR found that TeleTracking CEO Michael Zamagias “had links to the New York real estate world — and in particular, a firm that financed billions of dollars in projects with the Trump Organization.”
Zamagias, according to Temple-Raston and Mak, “came from the real estate sector” and founded the real estate company, Zamagias Properties, in Pittsburgh in 1987. And Zamagias has long been a GOP donor, the NPR reporters observe.
Howard Cooper, a partner in the Manhattan-based company Cooper-Horowitz, had a business relationship with Zamagias. Neal Cooper, his son, told NPR, “(Cooper-Horowitz) did business with Michael in the late 1980s. I don’t know if we ever did big deals with him, but we ran in the same circles. I learned a lot from Michael. He was always one or two steps ahead of the next guy.”
Cooper-Horowitz, according to Neal Cooper, had extensive dealings with the Trump Organization. Neal Cooper told NPR, “I didn’t handle Trump’s account, but I’ve been in meetings with Trump.  We did tons of business with him — billions of dollars of business.”

0,2020-08-03T20:04:44+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/new-report-reveals-one-of-the-funders-of-the-federalist-and-how-right-wing-commentators-warp-the-news/,New report reveals one of the funders of The Federalist — and how right-wing commentators warp the news,"Some right-wing pundits will offer a policy-by-policy defense of President Donald Trump, while right-wing pundits of the Never Trump persuasion — from CNN’s Ana Navarro and MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough to Bill Kristol and Charlie Sykes of The Bulwark — will go issue by issue while slamming the president. But Jeremy W. Peters, in an article for the New York Times, examines a third type of right-wing pundit: one who is generally pro-Trump but is less interested in defending Trump on the issues than demonizing Trump’s liberal critics.
“What these writers and pundits don’t tend to do is make the doggedly pro-Trump defenses that appear on Breitbart and erupt from the mouth of Sean Hannity,” Peters explains. “Often, they don’t bother at all with the awkward business of trying to explain away Mr. Trump’s latest folly. Instead, they offer an outlet for outrage against those the president has declared his enemies, often by reducing them to a culture war caricature of liberalism.
Peter cites The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway and Allie Beth Stuckey (who hosts the podcast “Relatable”) as examples of pundits who fall into that category. Stuckey, according to Peters, “does not go out of her way to defend the president” but does go out of her way to demonize his liberal critics.
“Through this lens,” Peters observes, “Mr. Trump’s transgressions seem irrelevant compared with the manifold misdeeds of everyone from the Clintons to CNN. Their portrayal of what the country would look like if the Democrats win big in November is indeed a frightening one to Trump supporters: a White House with Sen. Bernie Sanders as the shadow socialist president; a Democratic House of Representatives where Rep. Ilhan Omar calls the shots; a society in which mask mandates are the first step in a government experiment with social control; a political arena where conservatives are badgered into silence.”
The piece also revealed one of The Federalist’s funders, who have long been kept secret, and indicated how the backer may have influenced its coverage:
Critics have asked who is funding the site, since ad revenue alone wouldn’t be enough to sustain its staff of 14 and political websites often rely on wealthy donors for support. The Federalist has not disclosed its supporters, leading to criticism that it is not being transparent about its agenda. But according to two people with knowledge of its finances, one of its major backers is Dick Uihlein, the Midwestern packing supply magnate and Trump donor who has a history of giving to combative, hard-right candidates, like Roy S. Moore of Alabama, who make many Republicans squeamish. (After Mr. Moore was accused of assaulting underage girls in 2017, The Federalist ran an opinion piece that defended men who dated young women as a practice with a long history that was “not without some merit if one wants to raise a large family.”)
Another pundit Peters discusses in his article is Ben Shapiro, who famously became the butt of jokes in the U.K. after calling British conservative Andrew Neil a “leftist” during an appearance on his BBC program (to Brits who are familiar with Neil, the notion that he is a “leftist” is beyond laughable). Shapiro is not deeply enamored of Trump the way that Breitbart’s staff are, but as Peters notes, Shapiro’s hatred of liberals by far outweighs his issues with Trump.
“Mr. Shapiro isn’t shy about calling out the president for his divisive and unfocused leadership, but far more often, he takes shots at Mr. Trump’s critics,” Peters explains. “Mr. Shapiro echoes other conservatives who deflect: Mr. Trump wasn’t helping anyone, for instance, by asking top public health officials to study whether disinfectant could be injected into the human body as a coronavirus treatment. But, Mr. Shapiro explained he didn’t actually tell people to put bleach in their bodies: ‘That doesn’t mean he was recommending actually injecting Clorox, people.’”
Tim Miller, a Never Trump conservative and GOP activist who writes for The Bulwark, told the Times that publications like The Federalist are motivated by “an unquenchable desire to take everybody else down a peg.” Miller, on the other hand, believes that Trump has been terrible for the conservative movement — and he is happy to express that view during his appearances on cable news.
With Hemingway, Stuckey and Shapiro, Peters observes, the main ingredient is “anti-liberalism” — not an intense adoration for all things Trump like one finds at Breitbart.
Nicole Hemmer, a research scholar at Columbia University in New York City, told the Times, “The conservative ideology that had been cohesive during the Cold War is falling apart. It seems to me that ‘owning the libs’ is kind of the way you hold everyone together when your policy preferences are coming apart.”

0,2020-08-03T19:41:39+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/justice-department-is-zeroing-in-on-the-takeover-of-credit-karma-by-the-maker-of-turbotax/,Justice Department is zeroing in on the takeover of Credit Karma by the maker of TurboTax,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
The Department of Justice is scrutinizing Silicon Valley giant Intuit’s $7 billion takeover attempt of Credit Karma, an upstart personal finance firm that became a competitor when it launched a free tax prep offering that challenges Intuit’s TurboTax product.
The probe comes after ProPublica first reported in February that antitrust experts viewed the deal as concerning because it could allow a dominant firm to eliminate a competitor with an innovative business model. Intuit already dominates online tax preparation, with a 67% market share last year. The article sparked letters from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., urging the DOJ to investigate further. Cicilline is chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee.
Government lawyers worry that allowing Intuit to snuff out a promising startup could harm American consumers seeking free tax prep options, according to a June memo from the company side that describes Intuit’s legal strategy, which was obtained by ProPublica.
The government is particularly interested in “the influence that Intuit’s purchase of Credit Karma will have on consumer tax preparation platforms and [the] software market,” according to the memo.
At this stage of the government’s review, the DOJ has requested more information from the companies, according to Intuit securities filings. After Intuit and Credit Karma respond, the government will decide whether to seek to block the deal.
Chris Sagers, an antitrust expert at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, said it appeared that Intuit was seeking the deal to eliminate a competitor. It reminded him of the “copy-acquire-kill” strategy that lawmakers criticized Facebook for at landmark antitrust hearings on Capitol Hill last week. “It won’t be lost on the DOJ staff lawyers that it is likely Intuit’s motive,” Sagers said.
An Intuit spokesman didn’t answer questions about the memo but said in a statement that: “By joining forces with Credit Karma, we plan to create a personalized financial assistant that will help consumers find the right financial products that put more money in their pockets. This is a benefit neither company could easily achieve on their own.”
He added: “This combination is not about tax. We are confident in the clear consumer and competitive benefits of our combination and look forward to continued engagement with regulators.”
The DOJ declined to comment. Credit Karma did not respond to a request for comment.
As part of its probe of the deal, the government is also asking Intuit for more information about its participation in the Free File program, under which TurboTax and other tax prep companies are supposed to offer free tax filing options to most Americans. As ProPublica has reported, millions of Americans eligible for the free services end up paying for tax prep anyway, often because of industry marketing efforts to steer them toward paid options.
In 2017, Credit Karma became the only major new entrant to the online tax prep business in over a decade. Its model threatened to upend the industry. The company offers a suite of free financial services (like credit monitoring) to its more than 100 million members and then makes money by using their data to pitch them credit cards and other financial products. Credit Karma’s tax prep product was just another way to draw in more user data.
Credit Karma boasted that it “never” charged for tax prep, even for services that “could cost over $200 when filing with TurboTax.” It was a departure from the model that had shaped the tax prep industry since the mid-2000s: advertise “free” tax prep in order to draw in new customers, and then use a variety of tactics to make as many users as possible pay. TurboTax is the undisputed master of the craft.
Credit Karma is a distant threat to TurboTax’s dominance — the company filed 40 million returns last year — but the relative newcomer ranks as the fifth-largest provider of online tax filing and has been growing rapidly.
Intuit already is considering a strategy to placate the DOJ to win approval for the deal: offering to spin off Credit Karma’s tax preparation product and sell it to another company, according to the memo. Such remedies are common. The logic is that if two companies seeking to merge have some overlapping business lines, those are sold off to a third party in order to preserve competition that the merger would otherwise extinguish.
But selling off the business, known as a divestiture, might not be enough, the memo acknowledges. That’s because Credit Karma’s tax prep product might not be able to survive as a potent competitor once it is spun off.
“Credit Karma offers its tax preparation business for free, primarily to generate business to its consumer finance platform,” the memo notes. “In order for DOJ to accept the divestiture remedy, the agency will need to be satisfied that Credit Karma’s tax preparation business will be viable when separated from Credit Karma’s robust consumer finance platform.”
Some antitrust experts view divestitures with skepticism because of instances in which they have fallen apart. In one notorious case, the government allowed supermarket chains Safeway and Albertsons to merge on the condition that they sell off stores in 130 local markets around the country. Just months after the deal went through, the small firm that bought the divested stores went bankrupt. Albertsons bought some of them back during the bankruptcy process.
“I’d be hesitant to rely on a divestiture in any deal where there’s serious anti-competitive risk,” Sagers said.
Merger enforcement has declined under the Trump administration in general. And the Antitrust Division, led by Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, has accepted some controversial mergers on the basis of divestitures, including the Sprint-T-Mobile deal.
The department’s guidelines state that, to pass muster, a divestiture must include all business assets that would allow the third-party purchaser “to be an effective, long-term competitor.”
The timeline for the DOJ’s investigation is not clear. In Intuit’s most recent public statements, the company said it expects the deal to close in the second half of 2020.

0,2020-08-03T19:23:47+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trump-knows-his-time-is-up-and-that-makes-him-extremely-dangerous/,Trump ‘knows his time is up’ — and that makes him extremely dangerous,"One of the first things that activists and educators who work to stop domestic violence learn is this: The most dangerous time for the victim is when she tries to leave the abusive relationship. The abuser, desperate to keep his power and control over the victim, will drastically escalate the threats and violence if he senses that she’s looking for an escape route. If she does get out, the abuser will often track her down and try to force her to return through violence. This is why advocates for victims emphasize the importance of careful planning to escape an abusive relationship, since abusers rarely just let a victim walk away.
The parallels between the situation of many abuse victims and the nation’s dilemma when it comes to removing Donald Trump from power have not been lost on feminists. As sex educator Twanna Hines noted on Twitter on Friday, Trump “knows his time is up.” She predicted that he will lash out the way that abusers do “when the relationship is ending.”
We’re already seeing the evidence that Trump, terrified of being kicked out by the voters, is getting increasingly unhinged in his flailing attempts to cling to power, as evidenced by last week’s threat — disguised as a helpful suggestion — to “delay” the November election.
The good news is that — despite the GOP’s usual willingness to embrace any scheme that maximizes their power for themselves, regardless of legal or or ethical concerns — leading Republicans seem disinclined to help Trump find some excuse to nullify Congress’ power to determine the date of the election. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has already used delay tactics to steal a Supreme Court seat from a Democratic president, ruled out using a similar strategy this fall to steal the election.
As my colleague Andrew O’Hehir reassuringly wrote over the weekend, it’s also unlikely that “Trump has anywhere near the courage, the confidence or the means to pull off any version of a coup with success” if he loses in November. It’s too big a task, with too many moving parts and too little buy-in from the corporate power interests that back the GOP, he argued.
But even though we’re likely to see a situation where former Vice President Joe Biden is sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2021, that doesn’t mean we’re in anything like a position to relax. Like the abusive husband who would rather see his wife injured or dead than let her move out in peace, Trump will, as Election Day nears, increasingly turn to schemes to keep power that will pose real threats — not just to our democracy, but to the immediate safety and well-being of Americans.
Even if Trump is successfully removed from office, the amount of damage he could well do to punish the American people for rejecting him is, frankly, terrifying.
The most obvious threat is the pseudo-military presence Trump is rapidly building up in the streets of American cities. He famously kicked this by tear-gassing peaceful protesters in Washington, and then moved the show across the country to Portland, Oregon. He’s now transitioning it to cities in swing states, including Cleveland and Milwaukee.
The presence of these federal police should make anyone uneasy. It’s becoming increasingly clear, as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., noted on CNN on Sunday, that Trump has no “plans to leave the White House” if he loses in November.
Even if, as O’Hehir persuasively argues, Trump is eventually pushed out, the grim reality is that his near-certain refusal to concede defeat  — something no losing candidate has done in the era of modern politics — will lead to all manner of chaos, and likely to violence. Earlier this summer, a bipartisan group of former government officials and political scientists gathered together for the Transition Integrity Project, which largely consisted of a series of war games to project possible outcomes if and when Trump refuses to concede.
“[I]n every scenario the answer includes street violence and political crisis,” Brian Beutler of Crooked Media explained in his weekly newsletter description of the project.
The project looked at the various political arson fires Trump will light as he desperately seeks to reject the election results, and I recommend that everyone read the Boston Globe’s coverage of these particulars. But what is most viscerally alarming, in light of the federal police buildup that’s occurred since the project, is the likelihood of street violence. Once Trump refuses to concede, there will almost certainly be widespread street protests against him. By then, Trump will have already had months under his belt of using federal police to tear gas, beat and arrest protesters. It’s unlikely that he would hesitate for a moment to use these forces to sow even more chaos and violence if Americans dare to protest his unwillingness to accept electoral defeat.
But that’s far from the only way that Trump is putting Americans in physical danger in his desperate efforts to keep power over a country that, as polling data shows, is eager to put him in the ex-president category. As the New York Times reported on Sunday, government scientists are concerned that Trump will try to force them to release something he can call a coronavirus vaccine by October — so he can claim credit for it, naturally — regardless of whether it’s been demonstrated to be safe or effective.
From the very beginning of the pandemic, Trump has made it clear that his only concern is winning re-election, and that if he has to sacrifice millions of Americans to sickness or even death to get there, he won’t think twice about it. He has defied the advice of medical scientists on enforcing lockdowns, wearing masks and expanding virus testing, mostly because he believed — however mistakenly — that efforts to fight the disease would hurt his re-election chances more than an unchecked pandemic. Now, with more than 4.6 million confirmed cases and 155,000 deaths, Trump expects the same medical scientists he’s derided for months to rush in and save his campaign — even if doing so makes the pandemic worse in the long run.
Trump’s increasingly desperate efforts to keep control aren’t just a threat to life and limb. His desire to prevent people from even being able to vote him out in November also threatens fundamental American institutions. That includes the institutions that aren’t ostensibly political at all, but exist to serve the daily needs of all Americans, such as the U.S. Postal Service.
Yep, like an abusive husband who threatens to kill the family pet if his wife leaves him, Donald Trump has declared war on the post office. Relatively quietly, he has been gutting the ability of the Postal Service to deliver mail on time, both out of Republican ideological hostility to good government and because Trump personally thought this would be useful as part of his years-long vendetta against Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
But now that it appears the election is going to be conducted in large part by mail, to allow voters to avoid exposing themselves to the coronavirus, Trump’s war on the post office has escalated. He has been demonizing mail-in ballots as fraudulent, as part of his run-up to rejecting the election results. (There is of course virtually no evidence of any voter fraud in the history of voting by mail.) Now the chips are falling into place: Trump undermines the ability of postal workers to deliver the mail on time, and then uses the fact that mail isn’t being delivered on time as an excuse to reject the results of the election.
The collateral damage of this strategy extends far beyond just electoral integrity, though certainly that would be enough reason to be freaked out. Americans rely on the mail system, now more than ever, for life necessities like paying bills or getting prescriptions filled. Trump, however, is fully prepared to demolish this critical institution in his desperate and hopefully fruitless bid to nullify an American election.
I point all this out not to alarm anyone unduly, but so we can be prepared. The success of a victim leaving an abuser depends largely on her willingness to anticipate her abuser’s violent reaction when she tries to get out. Having a clearly thought-out escape plan can be the difference between getting away successfully or getting hurt.
Similarly, Americans will need an escape plan to get away from Trump. Even if our institutions successfully hold up well enough that a new president takes office in January, the amount of damage Trump can do to the country in his scorched-earth efforts to hang onto power is terrifying to contemplate. We need to understand that he will not be held back by conscience or decency from doing physical harm to Americans or destroying even backbone institutions, and plan accordingly. This isn’t just about winning back the White House and saving democracy. It’s about minimizing the casualties along the way.

In discussing what he sees as the broad portions of an agreement the President used a real estate term to openly solicit the payment that would have to be made to the U.S. Treasury.
“I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the U.S. Treasury of the United States, because we’re making it possible for this deal to happen,” Trump told reporters Monday afternoon.
“Now they don’t have any rights, unless we give it to them,” Trump continued. “If we’re going to give them the rights then it has to come into this country, it’s a little like the landlord-tenant. Without a lease, the tenant has nothing, so they pay what’s called ‘key money’ or they pay something, but the United States should be reimbursed.”
Trump is actively forcing the sale of a foreign-owned company, after announcing he would ban it over the weekend. And now that he’s forcing the sale, he’s saying the U.S. should get a “substantial” cut from the sale of the company – or he will not allow it to go through.
In some states and certain situations, “key money” is illegal.
It is not known if any other U.S. company purchasing a foreign asset or company was ever required to pay what effectively sounds like a bribe.

0,2020-08-03T18:40:11+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/meet-the-disturbing-trump-aide-who-admitted-he-wanted-the-president-to-be-more-of-a-fascist/,Meet the disturbing Trump aide who admitted he wanted the president to be ‘more of a fascist’,"When CNN wanted to feature a stridently pro-Trump pundit in 2019,  they often turned to Steve Cortes — whose willingness to defend President Donald Trump at every turn stood in stark contrast to the views expressed by conservative CNN pundits like S.E. Cupp and Republican strategist Ana Navarro. Cortes is now a senior adviser for Trump’s reelection campaign, and an article by the Daily Beast’s Scott Bixby exposes some of his more extreme views.
Navarro and Cupp are conservative but not far-right; Cortes is far-right, and Bixby offers some examples in his August 3 article. Trump drew widespread criticism when, on June 1, protesters in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. were violently removed by law enforcement so that Trump could walk from the White House to St. John’s Episcopal Church for a photo-op; in Cortes’ view, Trump hasn’t been harsh enough with protesters.
On the June 25 broadcast of his program, “The Steve Cortes Show,” Cortes remarked, “If Trump were the fascist that they pretend that he is, wouldn’t he have cracked down much, much harder on the unrest in the American streets? To be quite honest, you know — when there were people being bloodied, cops being attacked, businesses being smashed — I could have used a tad bit more of a fascist Trump.”
Cortes is also known for promoting conspiracy theories. For example, he has claimed that Black Lives Matter is being manipulated by billionaire George Soros in order to achieve the “nullification of America.”
“I think this is incredibly important that we talk about George Soros and others,” Cortes said on his radio show on June 9. “There are some very powerful, very well-financed actors, both individuals and groups on the left, who have decided that they are going to use Black Lives Matter as their vehicle, as their vehicle to achieve — and I really don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say this — to achieve a nullification, really, of America, of our founding principles.”
Cortes has also downplayed the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, not unlike many others on the far right.
Bixby notes, “Many of Cortes’ statements track with the publicly expressed opinions of President Trump, who has denied the existence of structural racism in law enforcement, called some Black Lives Matters protesters ‘terrorists’ —  and who has dismissed concerns about the further spread of COVID-19 infections due to packed classrooms in public schools.”
Trump, Bixby observes, has been fascinated by the fact that Cortes is a light-skinned Latino and once commented, “He happens to be Hispanic, but I’ve never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do.”
Although Cortes often got a workout from those he debated at CNN last year — including Navarro, who once insulted Cortes by filing her nails while he was speaking in Trump’s defense — one of the most intense grillings came from al Jazeera’s Mehdi Hassan in January.
Michael Gwin, who is working on former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, isn’t surprised that Cortes is now a senior adviser for the Trump campaign. Gwin told the Beast: “Donald Trump’s spent years dividing America and pitting people against each other for political gain. So, it’s no surprise that he would hire top aides who have done the exact same thing.”

0,2020-08-03T18:39:21+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/would-republicans-fill-a-supreme-court-vacancy-even-during-trumps-last-weeks-of-course-they-would/,Would Republicans fill a Supreme Court vacancy even during Trump’s last weeks? Of course they would,"When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February of 2016, Senate Republicans discovered a heretofore unidentified, now-infamous caveat to President Barack Obama’s constitutional powers: Black presidents aren’t allowed to fill vacant Supreme Court seats during an election year. The Senate refused to even consider the nomination of Merrick Garland, who was put forward by Obama for the role; instead, the seat was simply left vacant for the duration of Obama’s term. When Republican Trump was installed as president the next year, the Senate swiftly confirmed his own conservative nominee.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and fawning Trump golf partner Sen. Lindsey Graham, among others, have not been shy in declaring that the previously made-up rule no longer applies under Trump. On the contrary, they say the Senate would move swiftly to confirm any last-minute nominees if a vacancy were to arise in the last months of Trump’s calamitous term. The recent diagnosis of liberal court icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with liver cancer (she is by all accounts being successfully treated) is putting new focus on these Republican court-packing inventions and un-inventions—and is pushing Democratic senators to more seriously consider expanding the court to rebalance it in the face of blatant Republican sabotages.
Whether Democratic senators will have the guts to actually do the thing remains an open question. But Sen. Tim Kaine—not exactly a liberal firebreather—is among those now open to expanding the Supreme Court if McConnell, Graham, and the others are insistent on undoing their own supposed ban on election-year nominees, notes NBC:
“If they show that they’re unwilling to respect precedent, rules and history, then they can’t feign surprise when others talk about using a statutory option that we have that’s fully constitutional in our availability.”
Unfortunately, that is phrased as a threat that depends on if Republicans go any further than they already have, rather than an observation about just how far they have already gone. The Democratic National Committee may go farther; they’re planning to make a call for “structural” court reforms part of the party platform.
The current Supreme Court has lost its legitimacy, and for structural rather than ideological reasons. The blocking of an Obama justice under a newly invented partisan rule that was discarded immediately afterwards put Neil Gorsuch on the court illegitimately; the Republican Senate’s role in hiding evidence during Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings was a near-perfect runup to the fiasco of discarded impeachment charges against Trump, not because anyone was willing to argue that Trump did not do the political extortion he was charged with but because Republican senators declared they simply did not wish to hear any evidence either way. The court is a product of the same Republican corruption that has debased the rest of Washington, and the nation. The party broke it.
“It would be very dangerous for Americans to begin to believe the Supreme Court was not the legitimate arbiter of our nation’s laws,” we often hear. True, but that ship has sailed. The Supreme Court is a parody of itself already; you cannot even make good money making bets as to which conservative justices will discard their own precedents and proclamations to bend each new argument towards the preferred “conservative” outcome, because everybody else also knows that the core of conservative justices will make those flips of logic whenever the need arises. Pointing it out is now a consistent feature—and perhaps the most consistent feature—of non-conservative dissents.
It is true that Trump replacing any Supreme Court position in the next few months would quickly blossom into yet another crisis of government as the Senate swiftly erased whatever self-declared impediments were thrown up in the past, the whole of America watched it happen, and a good chunk of America came to the conclusion that the Supreme Court was now simply a structural appendage of the Republican Party. Again, though: ship, sailed. Watching the Kavanaugh nomination and listening to McConnell’s unending carousel of new-rules-that-are-not, does anyone think the Supreme Court is not that appendage right now?

0,2020-08-03T18:15:18+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/white-working-class-voters-are-finally-turning-on-trump/,White working class voters are finally turning on Trump,"When I wrote How to Win Rural Voters Without Losing Liberal Values for the June/July/August issue of the Washington Monthly, I was seeking a way for the Democrats to win back the White House, the House of Representatives, and control of state legislatures. The title of the piece carried more meaning than you might think, because it wasn’t solely about the moral quandary of courting the votes of so-called “deplorables.” It was part of my thesis that a party dependent primarily on affluent, well-educated suburbanites would do a poor job of being an advocate for working class men and women, irrespective of their race. For a host of reasons, I wanted the Democrats to pursue a broad front strategy, and I absolutely believed that Trump’s complete dominance of white working class voters was reversible.
I might have argued that Trump was certain to be such a colossal screw up that he’d lose a significant chunk of his support, but that would have hardly created a blueprint for action. I wasn’t content to act on faith, which is why I emphasized the importance of Democrats taking antitrust enforcement seriously, in an effort to revitalize small business ownership and opportunity throughout small town America. As it turns out, the Democrats didn’t have to do much of anything but sit back and let Trump alienate first the suburbs and now the remainder of the country.
That’s not entirely accurate, actually, because while suburban seats formed the basis for the new Democratic House majority after the 2018 midterms, the Republicans actually lost a higher percentage of their support in safely red districts. The “deplorable” defection was significant two years ago, it just didn’t have much of an effect. It’s a process that has sped up and now threatens to have a huge effect.
Harry Enten explains for CNN that white working class voters have turned on Trump to a significant degree.
Biden has clear leads in an average of the last three CNN approved polls in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On average, Biden is up by 9 points in Michigan, 11 points in Pennsylvania and 10 points in Wisconsin.
Biden’s upward trajectory is because of vast improvements among White voters in a comparison of Biden’s standing in each poll to how Clinton did with them…
…Still, the size of Biden’s rise over Clinton in these states is clear enough that it’s well outside the range of any statistical anomaly.
Michigan: Trump leads by an average of 3 points among White voters. Four years ago, Trump won amongst these voters by 15 points.
Pennsylvania: Biden is ahead by 3 points with White voters. In 2016, Trump won them by 15 points.
Wisconsin: Biden’s up by 6 points with White voters. Last election, Trump took them by 7 points.
These are three important states, but the collapse of Trump’s advantage with white voters is having an impact on races in every state, including Republican strongholds like Texas, Georgia, Arizona, and Kansas. It was never true that white working class voters were inseparably wed to Donald Trump. They still form his strongest group of support, but they were a bedrock part of the New Deal Democratic coalition for a reason. They knew the Republicans were the party for their factory bosses and distant plutocrats. They belonged to a working man’s party until the economy stopped delivering them a decent lifestyle, and then they became susceptible to highly targeted media-driven efforts to appeal to their basest instincts and cultural alienation.
They’re still susceptible to those messages, but they’re turning on Trump because he’s manifestly terrible at his job. It won’t take too much of a defection for “safe” red districts and states to begin to fall in the Democrats’ column. And that will have one big consequence. For the first time in a long time, the country will get less polarized. It will be less polarized geographically, and also less polarized by race and culture. As a result, the country will become more governable.
There will be Democrats who don’t want these voters in their coalition, just as there are Democrats who don’t welcome the #NeverTrumpers who brought us Dick and George’s Excellent Adventure in Iraq. They won’t be reliable allies or stalwart members of the base. But, on many economic issues, they can be crucial supporters. If you want a higher minimum wage, a more comprehensive health care system, and the breakup of super-monopolies that are stifling economic opportunity, these folks are going to be very helpful.
Large, durable political majorities have always included some “deplorables.” Lincoln’s Republican Party took in the Know-Nothings. FDR’s majority was anchored in the segregated South. Big majorities make it possible to do big things, and that’s what the country needs right now.

According to Times reporters William K. Rashbaum and Benjamin Weiser, the filings indicate a “significantly broader inquiry than the prosecutors have acknowledged in the past.” And in the filings, Vance’s office argues that Trump should have to comply with subpoenas that demanded eight years of the president’s financial and tax documents.
Rashbaum and Weiser explain, “The reports, including investigations into the president’s wealth and an article on the congressional testimony of his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, said that the president may have illegally inflated his net worth and the value of his properties to lenders and insurer.”
According to the Associate Press, Vance has been investigating reports of “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization.”
BREAKING: The Manhattan district attorney’s office suggested on Monday that it has been investigating President Trump and his company for POSSIBLE BANK AND INSURANCE FRAUD, a significantly broader inquiry than the prosecutors have acknowledged in the past. https://t.co/chQuT2JUuY
— Spiro Agnew’s Ghost (@SpiroAgnewGhost) August 3, 2020
The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that it Vance’s office had a right to demand Trump’s financial documents as part of an investigation — and that Trump was not sheltered from such requests. Trump had been arguing that executive privilege sheltered him from Vance’s inquiries.
Vance’s office has been investigating to determine, among other things, if hush money payments to women Trump had extramarital affairs with — including adult film star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal — were illegal.

However, we may not know all the winners at the end of Tuesday. With the coronavirus pandemic fueling a surge in mail voting, election watchers everywhere should expect that we might not learn the results in every race for some time—perhaps days or even weeks.
Our live coverage will begin at 8 PM ET Tuesday night at Daily Kos Elections when the polls close in Missouri and most of Kansas and Michigan. You can also follow us on Twitter for blow-by-blow updates. And you’ll want to bookmark our primary calendar, which includes the dates of the presidential and down-ballot primaries in all 50 states—many of which have been changed—as well as our separate calendar tracking key contests further down the ballot taking place nationwide this year.
ARIZONA
Polls close at 10 PM ET/ 7 PM local time.
• Maricopa County Sheriff (R) (48-45 Trump, 54-44 Romney): Disgraced former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio faces two fellow Republicans in a bid to regain his old post. The winner will take on Democratic incumbent Paul Penzone, who four years ago denied Arpaio a seventh term as the top lawman of Arizona’s largest county, in the November general election.
Arpaio’s two intra-party foes are Jerry Sheridan, who served as his chief deputy during his long reign of terror, and Glendale police officer Mike Crawford. Long a favorite of national conservatives, Arpaio has outraised Sheridan $1.2 million to $105,000, while Crawford took in only $5,000. Penzone, by contrast, has hauled in $643,000.
Other Arizona Races to Watch:
• Corporation Commission (R)
• Maricopa County Attorney (D)
• Pima County Prosecutor (D)
KANSAS
Polls close at 8 PM ET / 7 PM local time in the portion of the state located in the Central time zone, where virtually all Kansans live, and an hour later in four sparsely populated counties along the state’s western border with Colorado.
• KS-Sen (R) (56-36 Trump, 60-38 Romney): Republicans have a nasty and expensive contest between former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Rep. Roger Marshall, and wealthy businessman Bob Hamilton. A few other Republicans are also running to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Roberts, but none of them have attracted much money or attention. The winner will face Democratic state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a former Republican who left the GOP two years ago and has no serious intra-party opposition.
Democrats and Republicans alike all agree that Kobach, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial election to Democrat Laura Kelly, could harm the GOP’s chances in the fall if he wins on Tuesday, and major outside groups from each party are spending millions to secure their desired outcome. A Republican outside group called Plains PAC has dropped $3.3 million on ads to weaken Kobach, while a Democratic-linked organization known as Sunflower State PAC has deployed $5.3 million on commercials meant to boost him and hurt Marshall.
Much of the GOP establishment has consolidated behind Marshall, including Roberts. The congressman has also benefited from positive ads from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Senate Leadership Fund, which is run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Kobach, in turn, has been aided by $1.7 million in spending from Free Forever, a PAC funded by far-right billionaire Peter Thiel and the only group that actually wants to see Kobach in the Senate.
Hamilton, meanwhile, has used his wealth to outspend his primary foes, but while some outside groups have run ads against him, they’ve mostly focused on Marshall and Kobach. However, Hamilton and Marshall have aired several negative ads targeting each other.
• KS-01 (R) (69-26 Trump, 70-38 Romney): Four Republicans are running to succeed Senate candidate Roger Marshall in this safely red western Kansas seat, though only two of them have attracted much money or support. Finney County Commissioner Bill Clifford, who has self-funded most of his campaign, has outspent former Lt. Gov. Tracey Mann, and he’s also benefited from more outside spending.
• KS-02 (R) (56-37 Trump, 55-42 Romney): Freshman Republican Rep. Steve Watkins was already facing a seemingly serious primary challenge from state Treasurer Jake LaTurner before the congressman was indicted on voter fraud charges in July. Another candidate, former state Labor Secretary Dennis Taylor, is also in, and while he’s raised little money, his presence could cost LaTurner some anti-Watkins votes. The winner will take on Topeka Mayor Michelle De La Isla, who doesn’t have any serious Democratic primary opposition.
Watkins has responded to the charges insisting that, like Donald Trump, he’s the victim of a corrupt prosecutor, and by portraying LaTurner as a career politician who has supported higher taxes. LaTurner has in turn run ads highlighting Watkin’s scandal and argued that the congressman’s weak win in the 2018 general election means that he could cost Team Red this Topeka-area seat in the fall. Despite Watkins’ extreme legal woes, however, LaTurner has proven to be a very weak fundraiser.
• KS-03 (R) (47-46 Clinton, 54-44 Romney): Democrat Sharice Davids flipped this suburban Kansas City seat last cycle, and five Republicans are all hoping to retake it. The only two contenders who have brought in much money, though, are former state party chair Amanda Adkins and Sara Hart Weir, the former head of the National Down Syndrome Society. Adkins has outspent Weir and benefited from another $215,000 in spending from a super PAC financed by her father.
MICHIGAN
Polls close at 8 PM ET in the portion of the state located in the Eastern time zone, where almost all Michiganders live, and an hour later in four small counties in the Upper Peninsula along the state’s western border with Wisconsin.
• MI-03 (R) (52-42 Trump, 53-46 Romney): Republican-turned independent-turned Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash is not seeking reelection, and five Republicans are competing to retake this seat in the Grand Rapids area. The winner will face attorney Hillary Scholten, who has no Democratic primary opponent.
The only two Republicans who have spent a credible amount of money are Army veteran Peter Meijer and state Rep. Lynn Afendoulis. Meijer, whose family owns an eponymous retail chain with almost 200 locations across the Midwest, has the backing of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and he’s outspent Afendoulis.
• MI-10 (R) (64-32 Trump, 55-44 Romney): Rep. Paul Mitchell is retiring after just two terms representing this safely red seat, which includes northern Macomb County and Michigan’s “Thumb” region, and three fellow Republicans are facing off to succeed him.
Wealthy businesswoman Lisa McClain has used her personal resources to massively outspend state Rep. Shane Hernandez and retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Doug Slocum; and a group called the U.S. Future Fund has also deployed $460,000 on ads supporting her and going after Hernandez. However, the extremist anti-tax Club for Growth has spent a hefty $1.5 million on pro-Hernandez and anti-McClain commercials. Mitchell is backing Hernandez, while former Gov. Rick Snyder is pulling for Slocum.
The only poll we’ve seen was a mid-July survey from WPA Intelligence that showed Hernandez leading McClain 33-27, while Slocum was in third with 10%.
• MI-11 (R) (50-45 Trump, 52-47 Romney): National Republicans haven’t shown much interest yet in targeting freshman Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens in this suburban Detroit seat, but five Republicans are running to face her this fall.
The two Republicans who have reported spending a notable amount are self-funding businesswoman Carmelita Greco and attorney Eric Esshaki. However, perhaps the candidate with the most name recognition is former Rep. Kerry Bentivolio, who won the GOP nomination 2012 in an utter fluke (remember Thad McCotter?) and then badly lost it two years later. Bentivolio has waged several failed campaigns since then as both a Republican and an independent; as per usual, he’s brought in little money for his latest endeavor. A mid-July WT&S Consulting poll for Bentivolio, though, showed him leading Greco 23-22, with Esshaki at 9%.
• MI-13 (D) (79-18 Clinton, 85-14 Obama): Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is one of the most high-profile members of the House freshman class, faces a primary rematch with Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones in this safely blue seat.
Each woman defeated the other on the same day in 2018 thanks to some unusual circumstances. Last cycle there were two different primaries here: A six-way contest for the full two-year term, and a four-way special election for the final months of former Rep. John Conyers’ term. Tlaib narrowly beat Jones 31-30 in the regular primary, but it was Jones who edged Tlaib 38-36 in the special, though her victory allowed her to serve just a few weeks in the House.
This time, Tlaib and Jones are the only candidates. Tlaib has massively outspent Jones, and a late July Target Insyght poll had the incumbent ahead 52-24.
Other Michigan Races to Watch:
• Oakland County Executive (D & R)
• Wayne County Prosecutor (D)
MISSOURI
Polls close at 8 PM ET / 7 PM local time
• MO-01 (D) (77-19 Clinton, 80-19 Obama): Longtime Rep. Lacy Clay defeated nurse and activist Cori Bush for the Democratic nomination by a 57-37 spread in 2018—a margin that would be a blowout in a general election but is relatively weak for a primary—and Bush is running again for this safely blue St. Louis seat.
Bush has argued that Clay, who has represented this seat for almost 20 years, has not risen to meet the challenges of this moment in American history. Bush has raised considerably more money for this campaign than her last effort, and she’s benefited from another $240,000 in outside spending from two groups, Fight Corporate Monopolies and the Justice Democrats. Clay seems to be taking Bush’s second bid more seriously, as evidenced by an attack ad he recently launched against her.
• MO Ballot (56-38 Trump, 54-44 Romney): Missourians will also be voting on a statewide ballot initiative called Amendment 2 that would expand Medicaid to 230,000 residents. The measure would amend the state constitution to prevent Republican lawmakers, who have consistently refused to expand Medicaid, from rolling back the expansion should it pass.
Supporters have castigated Republican Gov. Mike Parson for moving the vote from November to the Aug. 4 primary, charging that Parson did so in the hopes that lower turnout would help defeat the amendment. However, a similar move in neighboring Oklahoma failed to prevent a comparable measure from narrowly passing in late June.
There’s been no public polling, but ballot measures to expand Medicaid in red states have been successful not only in Oklahoma but also in Idaho, Utah, and Nebraska, all of which voted in favor in 2018. Advocates have argued that Missouri is missing out on its fair share of federal tax dollars (which would pay for most of the expansion), while opponents, who have been heavily bankrolled by billionaire GOP megadonor Rex Sinquefield, have resorted to baseless racist claims that passage would mean “illegal immigrants flooding Missouri hospitals.”
Other Missouri Races to Watch:
• St. Louis County Executive (D)
• St. Louis City Circuit Attorney (D)
WASHINGTON
Polls close at 11 PM ET / 8 PM local time.
Washington’s top-two primary requires all candidates to compete on one ballot rather than in separate party primaries. The two contenders with the most votes, regardless of party, advance to the Nov. 3 general election. Candidates cannot win outright in August by taking a majority of the vote.
• WA-10 (51-40 Clinton, 56-41 Obama): A total of 19 candidates are campaigning to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Denny Heck in this seat located in the Olympia area and Tacoma suburbs. There are eight Democrats and eight Republicans as well as three independents, making it possible that only one party will be represented in the general election.
The three most serious candidates are all Democrats. State Rep. Beth Doglio, former state Rep. Kristine Reeves, and former Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland have all spent comparable amounts of money. Former Heck district director Phil Gardner is also running but was far behind financially. The Congressional Progressive Caucus has spent $336,000 to help Doglio, while the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has deployed $246,000 to aid Reeves. While Strickland doesn’t have much outside support, though, she has former Democratic Govs. Gary Locke and Christine Gregoire in her corner.
If Reeves or Strickland were to win, either would be the first African American to represent Washington in Congress, while Dogilo, who is bisexual, would be the state’s first LGBTQ member. Reeves would also be the first Latina to represent the state as a Democrat, while Strickland, whose father is Black and whose mother was born in Korea, would be the country’s first Korean American congresswoman.
Other Washington Races to Watch:
• WA-LG

Democrats in Congress have been investigating Linick’s firing, and Politico is reporting that they have subpoenaed four State Department officials to testify: Undersecretary Brian Bulatao, Acting Legal Adviser Marik String, Senior Adviser Toni Porter and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mike Miller.
The four subpoenas were issued by Rep. Eliot Engel, Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In a joint statement, Engel —  along with House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney and New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee — said, “The (Trump) Administration continues to cover up the real reasons for Mr. Linick’s firing by stonewalling the Committees’ investigation and refusing to engage in good faith. That stonewalling has made today’s subpoenas necessary.”
News: House Democrats just issued a subpoena for top @StateDept officials are part of their investigation into IG Linick’s firing:
– Undersecretary Bulatao
– Legal Adviser Marik String
– Senior adviser Toni Porter
– DAS Mike Miller (Pol-Mil)
— Josh Lederman (@JoshNBCNews) August 3, 2020
Politico reporter Kyle Cheney notes that Bulatao “is seen by Democrats as a linchpin in their investigation, an enforcer of sorts for (Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo —  who Linick said attempted to bully him into shying away from sensitive investigations about Pompeo’s use of taxpayer resources and stewardship of an arms sale to Saudi Arabia.”
Previously, Bulatao was scheduled to testify on July 2, but Democrats agreed to a delay.
Cheney explains, “The strained relationship between Linick and Bulatao is at the heart of the” investigation by Democrats in Congress. Bulatao, Cheney notes, alleged that “Linick botched an investigation into his own office’s handling of a sensitive report about political retaliation inside the State Department, which leaked to the media ahead of its release. Linick was cleared in that probe by Pentagon watchdog Glenn Fine, who Linick had asked to conduct the review. Linick told lawmakers he faced pressure to stop probing the Saudi arms sale, which Pompeo allies stated was a policy dispute as opposed to a question of management.”

0,2020-08-03T17:04:07+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trumps-anti-biden-s-arent-working-in-pennsylvania-a-state-the-president-cant-afford-to-lose/,Trump’s anti-Biden attacks aren’t working in Pennsylvania — a state the president can’t afford to lose: report,"Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio are the four states that GOP strategists have been describing as President Donald Trump’s “Rust Belt firewall” — states that went to President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012 but favored Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. But that “firewall” has not been holding up for the president. Trump’s reelection campaign has “temporarily” suspended its advertising in Michigan, although it continues to advertise in the other three — all of which are clearly in play for former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. And Philadelphia-based reporter Holly Otterbein, in an article published in Politico on August 2, stresses that so far, Trump’s attacks on Biden have not been resonating in Pennsylvania.
“Senior citizens and suburban voters are sinking President Donald Trump’s campaign across the country,” Otterbein explains. “But here in Pennsylvania — home to one of the largest populations of residents age 65 or older and where suburbanites comprise more than half of the electorate — their defection to Joe Biden is hurting Trump even more acutely. It’s a very big problem in a swing state that’s central to his Rust Belt path to victory.”
Comparing Trump’s poll numbers in Michigan and Pennsylvania, one can see why his campaign is focusing on the Keystone State In July, polls found Biden leading in Michigan by 12% (CNBC/Change Research), 10% (Morning Consult and YouGov/CBS News) or 11% (Fox News). The polls in Pennsylvania haven’t been quite as bad for Trump — although they haven’t been encouraging either. Recent polls have found Biden ahead in Pennsylvania by 9% (Franklin and Marshall), 8% (Morning Consult), 11% (Fox News), 6% (CNBC/Change Research) or  4% (Mason-Dixon).
Politico discussed Trump’s performance in Pennsylvania with some major politicians in that state, including Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, Jr. (who won a third term by double digits in 2018). Casey told Politico, “Joe Biden — his party is not in power. So, just by definition, he’s the candidate of change. That’s a huge advantage. No matter what Hillary Clinton did with her campaign schedule, she was running after eight years of a Democratic president. So, when you’re running after eight years of your party, you are not the change candidate.”
Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle, who represents Pennsylvania in the U.S. House of Representatives, believes that Biden doesn’t inspire negative feeling among the GOP base the way that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez do.
Boyle told Politico, “Hating Joe Biden doesn’t juice up their base and their Fox News viewers the way going after Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and AOC do. You can make certain assumptions and wonder why that is. Is gender a factor? Is race a factor? I don’t know. I have certain suspicions.”
In 2016, Trump became the first Republican to win Pennsylvania in a presidential race since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Trump, Otterbein recalls, “won Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes by taking a path that defied expectations: he won blue-collar, often traditionally Democratic areas in northeastern and northwestern Pennsylvania, surged in rural regions, and performed poorly in the moderate Philadelphia suburbs. Overall, he carried suburban voters by 8 points and seniors by 10 points in the state, according to exit polls.”
Of the four Rust Belt states that Trump was able to flip in 2016, Ohio is the most GOP-friendly. Polls have shown a close presidential race in the Buckeye State in 2020. But in Wisconsin, some polls have not been encouraging for Trump’s campaign. Recent polls have shown Biden ahead in Wisconsin by 10% (Redfield and Wilton), 5% (Change Research), 8% (Gravis Marketing) or 7% (Morning Consult).
If Biden carried every state that Clinton won in 2016 but flipped Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, he won be elected president. But the Rust Belt is not the only part of the U.S. in which polls have shown Biden to be quite competitive in swing states: recent polls have shown him performing well in Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.

Trump relied heavily on the bank for loans when other top banks refused to do business with him after a series of bankruptcies and defaults; he still owes hundreds of millions to the financial giant. Kushner’s family also borrowed millions from the bank.
Both Trump and Kushner were clients of Rosemary Vrablic, a managing director and senior private banker at Deutsche Bank. The bank opened an investigation into an apartment which Vrablic and two other colleagues at the bank bought for $1.5 million in June 2013 from a company called Bergel 715 Associates, The Times reported.
The review was opened after Kushner revealed in his annual personal financial disclosure filed last week that he and wife Ivanka Trump had earned between $1 million and $5 million last year from Bergel 715 Associates. A source familiar with Kushner’s finances told The Times that Kushner owned a stake in the company when Vrablic bought the apartment.
“Typically, banks restrict employees from doing personal business with clients because of the potential for conflicts between the employees’ interests and those of the bank,” The Times wrote. “Deutsche Bank said it had not been aware that Ms. Vrablic and her colleagues had done business with a company part-owned by Mr. Kushner.”
The bank opened the review after Kushner’s financial disclosure was filed.
“The bank will closely examine the information that came to light on Friday and the fact pattern from 2013,” Deutsche Bank spokesman Daniel Hunter told The Times.
Kushner Companies denied Jared Kushner’s involvement.
“Kushner is not the managing partner of that entity and has no involvement with the sales of the apartments,” spokesman Christopher Smith told The Times.
The size of Kushner’s stake in Bergel 715 is unclear. The company has sold dozens of condos in the Park Avenue building over the last four decades, according to the report. At least one of the apartments was sold to Kushner Companies.
Though Kushner and Ivanka Trump previously listed the entity used to make the investment in the company, this was the first year they listed income from Bergel 715. The income they reported was not related to the sale to Vrablic, The Times reported. There is also no indication that the apartment was sold below market value.
Vrablic is reportedly a “leading private banker” in New York who worked with the Kushner family before even coming to Deutsche Bank in 2006. In 2011, Kushner introduced Vrablic to future-President Trump when most top banks balked at doing business with him.
“I introduced him to this woman Rosemary,” Kushner testified to the House Intelligence Committee in 2017. “She is one of the biggest private wealth bankers, probably in the world. Amazing banker, amazing woman. Very smart banker. And she banked my family for a long time.”
The following year, the bank lent President Trump about $175 million for his Doral golf resort in Florida and the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. Trump later pursued a $1 billion loan when he unsuccessfully sought to buy the NFL’s Buffalo Bills. Financial documents submitted by longtime former Trump “fixer” Michael Cohen showed that Trump inflated his net worth by about $4 billion in his pursuit.
Though his NFL bid was rejected, Trump later got another $170 million in loans from the bank for his Washington hotel. Trump later inflated Vrablic’s role at the bank, as well during his 2016 presidential campaign.
“I am friends with all the major banks. They are dying to do business with me,” Trump insisted to the Times in 2016 when pressed on financial firms’ refusal to do business with him. “Why don’t you call the head of Deutsche Bank? Her name is Rosemary Vrablic. She is the boss.”
That year, anti-money-laundering specialists at the bank recommended that multiple transactions by companies controlled by Trump and Kushner be reported to the Treasury Department’s financial crimes watchdog. At least some of the transactions “involved money flowing back and forth with overseas entities or individuals, which bank employees considered suspicious.” However, executives at the bank rejected the suggestion and never reported them, the Times reported last year.
The Department of Justice last year launched an investigation into the bank’s compliance with money laundering regulations.
The watchdog group Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington (CREW) also called on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors to investigate whether the bank failed to report suspicious financial activity by Trump and Kushner.
“Deutsche Bank’s careless attitude towards banking compliance laws and failure to police its accounts may now be impacting American government at the highest levels,” CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. “Questions about transactions between President Trump and foreign actors whose conduct seemingly warranted suspicious activity reports, potentially facilitated by Deutsche Bank, harms the public legitimacy of the institution of the presidency itself.”

And in a scathing op-ed for his website, Morantz compares President Donald Trump to the infamous cult leader Jim Jones, arguing that Trump, in effect, committed “mass murder” by downplaying the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and encouraging large gatherings despite the dangers.
In 1978, the same year in which Morantz survived a rattlesnake bite, Jones was responsible for a mass killing in a remote area of Guyana — where the leader of the People’s Temple ordered his followers to drink Kool-Aid that was laced with cyanide. More than 900 cult members died at the Jonestown settlement on November 18, 1978, and in 2020, the slang expression “drinking the Kool-Aid” is still used to criticize people who blindly accept bad information.
Morantz, now 74, believes that Trump’s followers have been “drinking the Kool-Aid” during the coronavirus pandemic — which, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, has killed more than 154,861 people in the United States and over 690,055 people worldwide (as of early Monday morning, August 3). And in his op-ed, Morantz argues that Trump’s mishandling of the pandemic has had much deadlier results than the Jonestown Massacre of 1978.
“On a long ago November 1978 night in the jungle of Guyana, a narcissistic and vicious cult leader played Pied Piper and lead his flock to a mass grave by convincing them it was in the world’s interest that they drink the poisoned Kool-Aid,” Morantz writes on his website. “(Now), an even more evil cult leader is playing Pied Piper and (leading) a greater number willingly to their deaths — but worse than Guyana — by having them take (in) a deadly virus before they die. They will spread and kill thousands of others.”
Referring to Trump’s Fourth of July rally in South Dakota, Morantz slams Trump for holding large gatherings this summer and not mandating the use of face masks at those events. In South Dakota, Morantz writes, the president “gathered somewhere around 7000 of his horribles to shun masks and cuddle as close as they (could) in the plains of South Dakota in worship of Donald Trump. From hell, Jim Jones rejoices.”
Other large events Trump held this summer include rallies in Tulsa and Phoenix. By encouraging mass gatherings during a deadly pandemic, Morantz argues, Trump has made himself “one of the greatest mass murderers of all time.”
In the 1970s, Morantz became famous for his anti-cult activity — and in 1977, he went after Synanon with a vengeance, taking action against the violent cult and its leader, the late Charles E. Dederich (who died in 1997). Morantz, in 1978, won a $300,000 judgement against Synanon on behalf of a married couple, who testified that the wife had been held against her will. Synanon members retaliated against Morantz by placing a rattlesnake in the mailbox of his home in Pacific Palisades, an affluent Los Angeles suburb; Morantz was bitten and spent six days in the hospital but survived.

0,2020-08-03T14:40:37+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trumps-craziness-is-scaring-off-exhausted-voters-in-the-rust-belt-states-ohio-columnist/,Trump’s ‘craziness’ is scaring off exhausted voters in the Rust Belt states: Ohio columnist,"In a column for the conservative Bulwark, political observer Daniel McGraw said voters in a key region between Pennsylvania and Ohio have had enough of the chaos in the Donald Trump’s White House and his failure to bring the jobs he promised them in 2016.
As McGraw points out, the region along the border encompassing Erie, Crawford, Mercer, Lawrence and Beaver counties in Pennsylvania was a solid Democratic region until Trump came along. Writing that candidate Trump swept into the area in 2016 with rallies where he promised jobs and better times ahead McGraw stated that Trump’s pitch was well-received and local voters turned out for him.
But now, three and a half years later, those promises are not only unfulfilled, but conditions have grown worse due to the coronavirus pandemic and those same voters are tired of his act.
“Four years ago, Trump campaigned like a rock star in this part of the country, betting smartly that one really big campaign event has more impact than 40 more traditional stops where he shakes hands and kisses babies in local diners. And Trump’s message resonated for these people looking for economic salvation,” he explained. “It was all about job growth—and that message worked in 2016. In Ohio, Trump won by about 442,000 votes, so his winning by a total of about 2,200 votes in the combined Youngstown counties (Trumbull and Mahoning, where Obama won by about 57,000 in 2008 and again in 2012) didn’t make much of a difference there. But in the five Pennsylvania counties on the northwest Ohio border, with their combined population of about 710,000—counties that Obama won by a total of 19,000 in 2008 and 3,500 in 2012—Trump won by 58,000 votes. Recall that Trump’s margin in the entire state was just 44,000.”
Now McGraw claims, a sense of weariness has engulfed voters and they are looking for change again — with University of Akron political scientist David Cohen agreeing.
“The craziness of last three years is exhausting people, and when people talk of Youngstown as being this big swath of red voters it is way overblown,” Cohen explained. “He came here and told people jobs are coming back and not to sell their homes and he was the one who was going to do all that.”
He then added, “Think about that. People who had been on the losing ends of jobs for 50 years were listening to some showman telling them he is going to reverse it all. They were desperate and bought in. But of course, it didn’t happen, and there is an awful lot of resentment toward him right now.”
McGraw notes that polling indicates that Trump fatigue is real and quantifiable, pointing out: “Poll numbers are showing that resentment. In Pennsylvania, Biden is up by 6.0 percent. In Ohio, he leads by 1.5 percent.”
According to Youngstown resident Monica Beasley, whose husband was laid off by GM, things have grown worse under Trump and they are $5,000 behind on paying their mortgage.
Right now, [we] can’t afford to do anything,” she said in an interview. “I feel like [its] the dog that’s chasing its tail but never catches it. I honestly don’t know what exactly I’m gonna do. I know I can’t continue in this situation. . . . This is the time I thought I’d be doing other things—just kind of slowing down and enjoying my life.”
“This year, the question in this part of the country has morphed from being whether Trump is a viable candidate for political leadership and economic revival to whether he has the basic rationality and human decency needed to lead the country through the crisis of the pandemic. Some polling shows Trump falling way short on that question,” McGraw wrote before pointing to another expert on the region who backed up prevailing attitudes.
According to Lara Putnam, a professor of political history at the University of Pittsburgh, “Older female voters are more suspicious of him now in this area, much more so than they were in 2016. Part of the reason is the occupational advantage women have at this time. Hospitals are where it is happening for political discussion. Education institutions are where networking is taking place. Women are more of the breadwinners now, and are dominating the political discussion much more than they used to.”
Rogers Smith, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that Trump’s popularity is in a steep decline in the region.
“Trump was able to pull out a compelling story for the people in this part of the country in 2016; they lost jobs and he spoke to them personally,” he explained to McGraw. “He’s in trouble now because he didn’t deliver, even before the COVID-19 epidemic ravaged job growth even further. And this is a politically very important place. It is diverse and no one section stands out. It’s vital because it is like a microcosm of the country. Neither party can really win without them.”

“Nevada’s clubhouse governor made it impossible for Republicans to win the state,” Trump wrote, referring to the Nevada State Senate’s passage Sunday of legislation that would send every active registered voter a mail-in ballot ahead of the November elections. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, is expected to sign the bill.
“Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation,” continued Trump, whose administration, critics warn, is currently attempting to sabotage and undermine the U.S. Postal Service.
“Using Covid to steal the state,” the president added. “See you in Court!”
As Common Dreams reported in May, the Republican National Committee and right-wing advocacy groups are spending millions on lawsuits combating state efforts to expand mail-in ballot access as a safe alternative to in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2020
Trump’s tweet Monday was just his latest baseless attack on vote-by-mail expansion, which the president has repeatedly claimed—without evidence—will lead to a surge in voter fraud and cost him the presidential race.
Contradicting the narrative pushed by the president and the GOP, Nevada’s Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske told state lawmakers last week that her office is not aware of any voter fraud from the state’s June primary, which was conducted largely by mail.
William McCurdy II, chair of the Nevada State Democratic Party, said in a statement Sunday that Trump’s “protestations against mail-in voting represent an utterly hypocritical attempt to deny Nevadans the same rights” he and members of his administration have exercised repeatedly in past elections.
“Trump and his allies have always been motivated by partisanship, even at the expense of American lives,” said McCurdy. “That he would threaten Nevada Democrats’ work to protect voting access through a crisis of his own making is both despicable and par for the course. But Democrats will not be intimidated. We stand with Nevadans and will do the necessary work to ensure every eligible voter can participate easily and safely in what will surely be the most important election in a lifetime.”

0,2020-08-03T14:03:56+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/neuroscientist-explains-why-christian-evangelicals-are-wired-to-believe-donald-trumps-lies/,Neuroscientist explains why Christian evangelicals are wired to believe Donald Trump’s lies,"President Donald Trump lies so often that it is no longer shocking when it happens, no matter how blatant or absurd the falsehood may be. Not only does Trump regularly exaggerate the truth, he frequently denies facts that can be observed directly from video or audio tapes. This has led some professionals to diagnose his lying as compulsive or pathological, and many psychologists have pointed out that he is constantly gaslighting his base—a term that refers to a strategic attempt to get others to question their direct experience of reality.
With so much evidence to contradict his claims, like having the largest inauguration crowd size despite pictures clearly showing otherwise, one must wonder how there are still people out there who believe anything the man says. But the fact of the matter is there are many who swallow it hook, line, and sinker. Most of his fervent supporters are convinced that Trump is the harbinger of truth when it comes to important issues like climate change—which is really just a “hoax perpetrated by the Chinese government”.
While this might sound laughable, it is a serious problem, as it has contributed to fake news and dangerous propaganda running rampant. Given its negative impact on society, it is important to understand why certain groups of people are more vulnerable to believing unsupported lies than others. For this, we must look to science for answers, and fortunately, the fields of psychology and neuroscience offer valuable insight.
One reason Trump supporters believe his lies comes from a basic fact about the brain: it takes more mental effort to reject an idea as false than to accept it as true. In other words, it’s easier to believe than to not.
This fact is based on a landmark study published in the journal PLOS ONE in 2009, which asked the simple question, how is the brain activated differently during a state of belief compared to a state of disbelief? To test this, participants were asked whether or not they believed in a series of statements while their brain activity was being imaged by an fMRI scanner. Some sentences were simple and fact-based (California is larger than Rhode Island), while others were more abstract and subjective (God probably does not exist). The results showed the activation of distinct but often overlapping brain areas in the belief and disbelief conditions. While these imaging results are complicated to interpret, the electrical patterns also showed something that was fairly straightforward. Overall, there was greater brain activation that persisted for longer during states of disbelief. Greater brain activation requires more cognitive resources, of which there is a limited supply. What these findings show is that the mental process of believing is simply less work for the brain, and therefore often favored. The default state of the human brain is to accept what we are told, because doubt takes effort. Belief, on the other hand, comes easily.
This troubling finding makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. If children questioned every single fact they were being taught, learning would occur at a rate so slow that it would be a hindrance. But this fact could be just as easily applied to both the political left and right. So how does it explain why conservatives, specifically evangelicals, are so easily duped by Donald Trump?
For Christian fundamentalists, being taught to suppress critical thinking begins at a very early age. It is the combination of the brain’s vulnerability to believing unsupported facts and aggressive indoctrination that create the perfect storm for gullibility. Due to the brain’s neuroplasticity, or ability to be sculpted by lived experiences, evangelicals literally become hardwired to believe far-fetched statements.
This wiring begins when they are first taught to accept Biblical stories not as metaphors for living life practically and purposefully, but as objective truth. Mystical explanations for natural events train young minds to not demand evidence for beliefs. As a result, the neural pathways that promote healthy skepticism and rational thought are not properly developed. This inevitably leads to a greater susceptibility to lying and gaslighting by manipulative politicians, and greater suggestibility in general.
If we want to combat the brain’s habit of taking the path of least resistance, which has destructive downstream consequences for critical thinking, as a society we must place more value on empirical evidence, and this must be reflected in how we educate our youth. Additionally, we must create an awareness of the fact that for the human mind, believing is more of a reflex than a careful and methodical action.

0,2020-08-03T13:46:51+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/gop-strategists-fear-a-kris-kobach-nomination-could-cost-republicans-greatly-the-senate-majority-runs-through-kansas/,GOP strategists fear a Kris Kobach nomination could cost Republicans greatly: ‘The Senate majority runs through Kansas’,"In Kansas’ Republican senatorial primary, voters will choose between former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and Rep. Roger Marshall — who some GOP strategists believe is by far the more electable of the two. And according to Politico’s James Arkin, one of the prominent Republicans who is sounding the alarm is Kevin McLaughlin, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
Although Kobach and Marshall are both hard-right politically, Kobach is more extreme — so extreme that even in deep red Kansas, he lost a gubernatorial race to a centrist Democrat in the 2018 midterms. That Democrat, Laura Kelly, is now governor of Kansas, where Kobach was a leading promoter of the racist “birther” conspiracy theory during the 2010s.
Arkin reports that on Thursday, July 30, McLaughlin appeared in a private Zoom call and warned that if Kobach receives the GOP nomination and loses in the general election, it could cost Republicans their U.S. Senate majority. McLaughlin, according to Politico sources, warned, “The Senate majority runs through Kansas.”
Earlier this year, Republican strategists were hoping that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would run for that U.S. Senate seat presently held by Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who is retiring. But Pompeo wasn’t interested, and Kobach’s Republican critics have been rallying around Marshall.
Democrats, according to Arkin, have been “meddling” in the primary and hoping that Kobach wins — as they believe he would be easier to defeat than Marshall, who, Arkin notes, was “leading Kobach comfortably in internal polling earlier in the summer. But after nearly $5 million was dumped in by a super PAC with ties to Democrats to elevate Kobach and bash Marshall’s image, Republicans acknowledge that the primary is a dead heat.”
“A Kobach victory would upend the battle for control of the Senate,” Arkin explains. “Democrats haven’t won a Senate race in Kansas since the 1930s, but with Kobach on the ballot, Republicans would be forced to sink millions into trying to defend a seat party officials believe should have stayed safely in their column. Republicans are already stretched thin on a Senate map that features more than a half dozen GOP incumbents in competitive races.”
The winner of the GOP senatorial primary in Kansas will likely be up against Democrat Barbara Bollier, a Kansas state senator who was a Republican in the past.
Arkin notes that another well-known Republican who is sounding the alarm and hopes Marshall receives the nomination is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In a pro-Marshall robocall, Gingrich described him as a “committed pro-life conservative” and a “great supporter of President Trump.” And in an appearance on a Kansas radio station, Gingrich warned, “Every poll I’ve seen says that Kobach can’t win a general election. (Kobach) did the worst statewide numbers when he ran for governor of any Republican in the last more than a decade. He’s weaker now.”

Greitens served as Navy SEAL before pursuing a career in politics, and according to the Kansas City Star, Vice President Mike Pence tried to pressure the U.S. Navy into reinstating the former Missouri governor in 2019. But Pence’s office, according to the Associated Press, has flatly denied that the vice president intervened in the matter.
Star reporters Tara Copp, Jason Hancock and Bryan Lowry explain that according to documents the publication has obtained, “Greitens had been charged with a felony in 2018 connected to allegations of violent sexual misconduct. Though the charge was ultimately dropped, the Navy wasn’t ready to welcome the former governor back at a time when the military was facing intense criticism over its response to sexual assault in its ranks. It was after the intervention of Vice President Mike Pence’s office that Greitens was allowed to return as a reservist, the documents show.”
In an e-mail dated May 24, 2019, the Star reporters note, Navy Vice Adm. Robert Burke wrote, “Since he was in the (individual ready reserve) at the time, we had no recourse. If he were in the AC (active component), or even RC (reserve component) on active duty, we would have gone after Art 120 (Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, rape and sexual assault). But for a reservist not on orders, or the IRR, we have no authority; it’s like holding a civilian accountable. How could/should that have been accounted for in the administrative move from IRR to [selected reserve)?”
Copp, Jason Hancock and Bryan Lowry report that through the Freedom of Information Act, the Star has obtained “more than 850 pages of documents” that shed light on “behind-the-scenes tussling over allowing the former Missouri governor back into the Navy” — which, they note, didn’t want him back in early 2019.
Devin O’Malley, a Pence spokesperson, denies that the vice president’s office had anything to do with Greitens’ reinstatement. Malley told AP, “Vice President Pence did not, nor did he authorize any staff to, intervene on behalf of Mr. Greitens.”

0,2020-08-03T12:17:01+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trump-is-doomed-and-he-knows-it/,Trump is doomed — and he knows it,"Donald Trump is doomed, and he knows it — in the limited, animalistic way he ever knows anything. His electoral prospects are dwindling toward the mathematical vanishing point, and his historical legacy is now sealed. There is no possible future in which he will not be remembered as the most catastrophically corrupt and incompetent U.S. president of the past 100 years, and quite possibly ever. If it’s any consolation to him, the damage he has done is enormous, and as Paul Rosenberg explored for Salon this weekend, it may never be undone.
No, I will not pause to listen to your sermon about “overconfidence,” or your superstitious lamentations about the lingering trauma of 2016. I was there too, and it was nothing like this. In fact, I wrote two articles that year — after attending the Republican and Democratic conventions, respectively — arguing that it felt like Trump was winning and that the Hillary Clinton campaign seemed clueless.
But all of us who covered that campaign were torn between what we could feel was happening, on a sort of electrical level, and the normative logic that suggested only one plausible outcome. So the first response to your demand for wolfsbane and incantations is that the dynamics of 2020 are completely different, and the second is that I’m not running Joe Biden’s campaign — which is a good thing for both of us — and if the Democrats find a way to screw up an election that’s been handed to them on a silver platter, wrapped in crinkly designer paper with a Godiva chocolate on top, then the whole party should definitely be sold off for scrap but it won’t be my fault.
Everything about Trump’s behavior in recent weeks or months speaks to this dawning, if childlike, half-awareness that he is staring right in the face of doom, defeat and failure. He has played chicken with those things his entire life, and has convinced himself — and to a large extent, the rest of us — that he can evade them through sheer cunning and the most brazen, shameless forms of salesmanship, which he mistakes for intelligence. None of that is working now, and his desperation is palpable.
It seems clear that Trump believed he could suppress or prevent the coronavirus pandemic through sheer force of will, and when that failed he believed he could use his dipshit Jedi mind-tricks to convince people that it either didn’t exist or didn’t matter. He believed that the Black Lives Matter protests were playing into his hands, and that out there in what he regards as “real America,” people remained hypnotized by the same provincial, racist anxiety and terror that was so potent from the late 1960s well into the ’90s. (To be fair, numerous mainstream observers shared that view at first, and I don’t mean to suggest that political current no longer exists.)
He believed his ludicrous Bible-clutching photo-op in front of St. John’s Church would cause patriotic moms and dads in the heartland to weep and swoon at his godly power. (In fact, I believe a great many devout Christians, including some conservative evangelicals, felt profoundly insulted, and not for the first time.) He believed his Keystone Kops pseudo-military intervention in Portland, Oregon — mail-order fascism on the cheap, as Salon columnist Lucian K. Truscott IV has put it — would be a display of macho dominance that would make the notional “suburban housewives” he both desires and despises go wobbly in the knees.
Donald Trump still believes that he can grab ’em by the you-know-what, and until now has avoided coming to grips with the reality that he is a morbidly obese 74-year-old man with a spray-on tan and an ingeniously structured hairdo that could be dubbed the Sat-on Beehive. At this point, his erotic allure is limited to sad-sack middle-aged men with expensive divorces, expensive pickups, lowered expectations and too many guns. He may hold the title of commander in chief, for now — and let’s not underestimate the danger in that — but he’s more like the incel in chief.
None of it’s working even a little, and after last week’s report that the U.S. economy contracted at an annual rate of nearly 33 percent in the second quarter — which is three times worse than the second-worst quarter recorded in the 73 years that such statistics have been collated — the Trumpian narrative has been reduced to shameless buck-passing and whining about the unfairness of fate, which is the behavior of losers, and of abuse victims who have grown up into abusers. A massive economic recession, more likely a depression, and what could well be 180,000 to 200,000 Americans dead by Election Day are not the kinds of headlines from which a presidency recovers. Trump and his shrinking band of courtiers can blame Barack Obama and Tony Fauci all they want, but the delusional zeal of the early Trump era has vanished, and what’s coming off those people now is the flop-sweat of desperation.
Trump’s supposed Republican allies, while still fearful of his fanatical voter base, have begun to back away from him, none too subtly. Needless to say, that has nothing to do with any version of political principle or any respect for “democratic norms”; the Republican Party left those things by the roadside a generation ago. For so-called leaders like Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, the issue now is simply survival: Their immediate task is to limit the damage of what they clearly understand will be a November bloodbath, and then to position themselves amid the ugly intra-party power struggle that is sure to follow. Their union with Trump was always a marriage of convenience, and they always knew no actual loyalty was involved on either side. Now that the convenience has evaporated, it probably feels good — in a small-minded, sadomasochistic register — to be the ones dumping Trump rather than the other way around.
I’m quite sure that McCarthy and McConnell, along with many other prominent Republicans, cannot wait to be rid of Donald Trump and are already rehearsing various death-of-Stalin monologues that range from “well, he expressed the true greatness of America but” to “honestly, I never really knew the guy.” What they may discover, however, is that the Republican Party after Trump is something like John Hurt’s character in “Alien” after the face-hugger falls off. He seems fine and normal! But as the robot scientist knows, he’s been impregnated with something awful, and once it gets a decent feed down there in the gummy darkness, it’s bustin’ out.
The remaining questions about Donald Trump are all much larger than he is, which is nothing new. One of the most striking peculiarities of this bizarre era is that such a small person, with such a limited understanding of reality, could command the national stage and a massive proportion of the media’s attention for the better part of five years. All by itself, that fact does not speak well of the condition of American civil society, let alone “democratic discourse.” Yet at the same time, the monotonous narcosis of the Trump years has also provoked a vigorous reaction, visible in different parts of society in different ways: #MeToo feminism, Black Lives Matter, the 2018 midterms, the upsurge of left-wing or “socialist” politics catalyzed by the Bernie Sanders campaign, which the Democratic Party has been startled to discover it cannot control or contain.
Will Trump try to delay or cancel the election? Will he try to rig the election by sabotaging the Postal Service or claiming premature victory based on partial results, or both? If and when he loses, will he protest that the whole thing was rigged and unfair, and announce that he’s staying in the White House indefinitely while Bill Barr investigates Democratic voter fraud? I don’t want to underestimate the inherent danger of this situation: We have a deeply wounded and profoundly delusional person at the head of the federal government, who is convinced that the world is unfairly stacked against him and does not care whether the things he says have any relationship to reality.
So, yes, Trump could try to do any or all of those things. But remember that he’s a “sniveling coward,” in the immortal words of Ted Cruz (who arguably turned out to be an even bigger one), not to mention profoundly ignorant and totally incompetent. Ultimately, I don’t think Trump has anywhere near the courage, the confidence or the means to pull off any version of a coup with success. He’d need a posse of powerful allies — not just Barr, who might enjoy giving it a whirl, but Republican leaders in Congress, the military brass, the Secret Service and the FBI, the Supreme Court and, most important of all, the top one-tenth of the one percent in the investment and banking class.
You won’t catch me claiming that “democratic institutions” or the “rule of law” will rescue us from Donald Trump. That manifestly has not happened, and any such hope rested on a set of charmingly old-fashioned assumptions in the first place. None of the people I just mentioned are greatly concerned with that stuff, but all of them — especially the last group, the financial and corporate overlords who control all the wealth and most of the power in our society — do not much care for chaos and disorder, and have seen about enough of it over the last four years.
No doubt Wall Street feels some collective concern about the potential cost of a Democratic presidency, especially under current social conditions — but Joe Biden, the longtime “senator from MasterCard,” was the Democrat the Mr. Monopoly crowd wanted all along. After the disastrous meltdown of the Trump presidency, they’ll welcome Biden with open arms, along with helpful dossiers of potential Cabinet nominees.
As Donald Trump has secretly known all along — stupid, injured manchild that he is — none of the people in the privileged classes of New York or Washington or California who pretended to love and admire him truly understood his greatness, and now that the waves are crashing over the bow they’re scurrying off the deck. He’ll be left at the end with the losers and incels and rubes in the red hats — stricken, lonely people who looked to him as a savior and for whom he feels only contempt. People he probably hates more than he hates Muslims or Mexicans or Black people, and possibly even more than he hates himself.

0,2020-08-03T12:02:33+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/millionaire-treasury-secretary-uses-debunked-gop-talking-point-to-justify-slashing-600-unemployment-insurance/,Millionaire Treasury secretary uses debunked GOP talking point to justify slashing $600 unemployment insurance,"Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday recycled a debunked right-wing talking point to justify the GOP’s proposal to cut by more than half the $600-per-week federal boost in unemployment benefits that expired at the end of last week, depriving around 30 million Americans of a key economic lifeline as joblessness remains at historic levels.
In an appearance on ABC‘s “This Week,” Mnuchin claimed “there’s no question” that the $600 weekly boost in unemployment insurance (UI) created a disincentive to work.
When host Martha Raddatz pointed to a recent Yale study that found “no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work,” Mnuchin responded, “I went to Yale, I agree on certain things, I don’t always agree.”
As a counterpoint, the Treasury Secretary cited a “Chicago study”—apparently referring to May research from the University of Chicago showing that under the $600-per-week boost, 68% of unemployed workers who were eligible for UI could have received benefits that exceeded their previous work income. That study, however, did not examine whether the benefits created a disincentive for the unemployed to seek work.
“There are cases where people are overpaid,” said Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker whose net worth is estimated to be around $400 million.
The $600 weekly payment amounts to around what a worker would earn working 40 hours per week at a $15-an-hour wage. The fact that some workers earned more under the enhanced unemployment benefits than they did from their jobs makes the case for raising wages, not cutting benefits, progressives have argued.
Senate Republicans have proposed cutting the $600 weekly boost to $200—a $1,600 monthly benefit cut for tens of millions of people.
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin tells @MarthaRaddatz “there’s no question” that $600 unemployment insurance is a disincentive to find a job in “some cases.”
“There are cases where people are overpaid,” he adds when pressed about study refuting his argument. https://t.co/HNQgCe39RN pic.twitter.com/1zceOdxULW
— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) August 2, 2020
In response to Mnuchin’s remarks, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) tweeted that “inflicting suffering on tens of millions of Americans by cutting unemployment benefits because of an anecdotal ‘some cases’ argument that has been refuted again and again by studies of actual data is a stupid way to make policy.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) slammed Mnuchin for wanting to to “slash $600 a week in unemployment benefits for 30 million workers who lost jobs” while supporting “the continuation of a $500 billion slush fund for corporations.”
“The Trump administration loves socialism for the rich, unfettered capitalism for everyone else,” said Sanders.
The $600-per-week increase in unemployment benefits expired on Friday as Republican and Democratic negotiators failed to reach an agreement to extend the payments—even amid dire warnings that a lapse could lead to a surge in evictions, increased hunger, and massive job loss.
Mnuchin on Sunday touted the White House’s offer of a one-week extension of the $600 payments, but Democratic congressional leaders and other critics dismissed the proposal as a “sham” given that it would likely take weeks for states to distribute the payments.
“They proposed it after it was too late to prevent a benefits lapse,” tweeted HuffPost‘s Arthur Delaney. “The last checks had already gone out. State workforce agencies have thoroughly demonstrated they don’t do policy changes on a dime. Republicans opposed the $600 from before anyone received their first check and they made sure the benefits stopped.”
Democratic leaders met with Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Saturday for a rare weekend discussion as the two sides remain far apart on key priorities for the next Covid-19 stimulus package, from unemployment benefits to additional aid for state and local governments.
In a Dear Colleague letter on Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) described the weekend meeting as “more productive than our previous discussions” but added that no agreement was reached.
“This is a very different kind of negotiation, because of what is at stake,” Pelosi wrote. “Millions of children are food insecure, millions of families are at risk of eviction, and for the nineteenth straight week, over one million Americans applied for unemployment insurance… All parties must understand the gravity of the situation in order to reach an agreement that protects Americans’ lives, livelihoods, and the life of our democracy.”

Clyburn warns Americans to ‘wake up’,"Appearing on State of the Union on CNN this Sunday morning, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn talked about former Vice President Joe Biden’s VP pick options, misinformation about voting by mail, and whether or not he thinks Donald Trump actually intends to leave office if he loses in November. “I don’t think he plans to leave the White House. He doesn’t plan to have fair and unfettered elections,” Clyburn said in a now-viral clip. He continued that he thinks Trump “plans to install himself in some kind of emergency way to continue to hold onto office.”
Here is that clip.
“I don’t think he plans to leave the White House. He doesn’t plan to have fair and unfettered elections. I believe that he plans to install himself in some kind of emergency way to continue to hold onto office,” Democratic Rep. James Clyburn says about Pres. Trump. #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/q0CgdTwWcX

“I know a little bit about history,” he continued, “and I know how countries find their demise. It is when we fail to let democracy, and the fundamentals of which is a fair unfettered election, and that’s why he is trying to put a cloud over this election, floating the idea of postponing the elections.” He also warned that the American people “had better wake up.”
The bigger picture is, of course, that Trump continues to weaponize claims of voter fraud, spew rhetoric about “rigged” elections, and declined to say he’d accept the election results during a truly bizarre Fox News interview. He also suggested delaying the federal elections until it’s “safe,” though he does not actually have the power to make such a change himself. Still, all of his spewings can sow doubt and distrust in the election process (and its results), which is dangerous in itself.

According to co-host Joe Scarborough senior Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (KY), Senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) are blocking bills because they are trying to enhance their prospects to replace Donald Trump as the face of the party after he’s gone and they’re ignoring their colleagues’ plight.
“Right now, Mitch McConnell is more than just a majority leader who is worried about where he, you know, where the caucus is,” Scarborough began while also noting that McConnell has been returning to his home state because his re-election is not assured. “He’s got to worry about his own race. Look at Martha McSally (AZ) who’s in a lot of trouble politically. Look at Cory Gardner in Colorado. Joni Ernst is Iowa is probably in trouble. Susan Collins in Maine in big trouble.”
“Yesterday in North Carolina this poll came out on Thom Tillis, and Thom Tillis is getting beaten by nine points in North Carolina — the deep south,” he continued. “I’m sorry, it seems the Republicans are just sitting on their hands, not doing anything about voting, economic relief for working-class and middle-class Americans in many states like Arizona, Colorado, Maine, North Carolina. Can Mitch McConnell and the Republicans really sit back and let Donald Trump rig the election and let Donald Trump and let Donald Trump basically tell millions of Americans, let them eat cake?”
“The real challenge, if you look at middle-classiAmericanscking points to the Republicans coming up with a plan to help these vulnerable senators, it’s Tom Cotton, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz,” Morning Joe contributor Jason Johnson offered. “The guys who want to run in 2024; the safe Republicans who think that, hey, ‘Donald Trump may be out of here and I want to set myself up to be one of the new leaders of the party.”
“They’re also the people standing in the way of creating the kind of relief that would help Susan Collins, Thom Tillis, Martha McSally and Joni Ernst,” he added. “The Republicans are in the vulnerable position of having to defend what the president is doing and they don’t know how to come up with a valuable plan. You know, it’s not just that we had the Susan Collins of the world and the Cory Gardners of the world, the fields they’re in is more competitive than six weeks ago. I don’t think Mitch McConnell realizes how tenuous his position of power is, that’s the reason everyone is scrambling for the doors.”

0,2020-08-03T11:10:36+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trump-threatens-to-ban-popular-social-media-app-tiktok-with-an-executive-order/,Trump threatens to ban popular social media app TikTok ‘with an executive order’,"News of a TikTok ban is sweeping the Internet. But why exactly is Tik Tok, a popular social media app, being banned? According to The New York Times, government officials fear that China could access information about Americans using the app, thus posing a threat to national security. (TikTok is owned by the Chinese internet company ByteDance, which has repeatedly denied allegations that it is operated or connected to the Chinese government.) As a result, Donald Trump has discussed banning the app on multiple occasions and announced Friday that he could do so “with an executive order.” “As far as TikTok is concerned we’re banning them from the United States,” Trump said aboard Air Force One on Friday.
Young Americans have criticized Trump’s announcement to ban the app, accusing him of threatening their freedoms of speech—some have even said such a ban would impact their decision to vote. “If it hasn’t already, I think this will definitely be a game-changer in young voters going out and voting for sure,” 18-year-old Kaylyn Elkins told NBC News. Owners of the app have said they will address the administration’s concerns by selling the app to U.S. operations, and reports that the app may be potentially bought by Microsoft are in the air. The app is estimated to have between 65 to 80 million users in the United States.
TikTok has gained a strong American following amid the pandemic. Users have been using it to not only cope with stay-at-home measures and to stay connected with friends, but to also spread information about the coronavirus. “Especially now, during this pandemic —it’s a weird, odd, scary time—and to know I’m not going through it alone is really comforting and it would be disappointing if it were to go away,” Elkins said. She added that, like her, many TikTok users are not concerned with the app’s connection to China and said that had it been owned by a company based in a different country,  the administration’s reaction would differ. “I think it’s just ridiculous considering what’s going on in the world and our country alone,” Elkins told NBC News. “I think if it was owned by a European country he wouldn’t even consider this idea.”
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) denounced Trump’s statement and reiterated the threat to freedom of speech banning the app would impose. “Banning an app like TikTok, which millions of Americans use to communicate with each other, is a danger to free expression and technologically impractical,” the advocacy organization said on Twitter.
To truly address privacy concerns with companies like TikTok, Congress must ensure that ANY company that services US consumers cannot hand over our data to any government without a warrant or equivalent.
Letting the president selectively ban platforms isn’t the solution.
— ACLU (@ACLU) August 1, 2020
Some young users even cited reserving tickets to Trump’s Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally as a reason why Trump was taking such actions. In June, a number of TikTok users reserved tickets to Trump’s rally without the intention of attending. “I feel like that could be one of the reasons he wants it gone,” Clara McCourt, a TikToker from New Jersey told NBC News. “I personally see a lot of politics on my TikTok … it’s definitely a very powerful tool in informing my generation.”
Many users have been using TikTok to criticize Trump and his administration, in addition to posting about racial injustice movements across the nation. The app has become widely popular for not only its fun and trendy videos but for its political and social justice-related content.
i find it interesting how trump is more worried about banning tiktok than he is about black lives

While many teens are worried about the outcome for the app, users were reassured Saturday in a video statement posted to TikTok by TikTok U.S. General Manager Vanessa Pappas. “We’ve heard your outpouring of support and we want to say thank you. We’re not planning on going anywhere,” Pappas said. “We are so proud of all the various communities that call TikTok their home.”

“These are the facts: 100 million Americans come to TikTok for entertainment and connection, especially during the pandemic. We’ve hired nearly 1,000 people to our U.S. team this year alone, and are proud to be hiring another 10,000 employees into great paying jobs across the U.S. Our $1 billion creator fund supports U.S. creators who are building livelihoods from our platform,” a spokesperson for TikTok told ABC News. “TikTok U.S. user data is stored in the U.S., with strict controls on employee access. TikTok’s biggest investors come from the U.S. We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform.”
According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Trump will take action on TikTok and other Chinese apps that cite national security risks “in the coming days”, CNN reported. “President Trump has said enough and we’re going to fix it, and so he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo said Sunday.

And the end result was that doors weren’t open 24 hours before a positive coronavirus case was reported.
A student at Greenfield Central Junior High School tested positive for the virus hours after returning to the campus in the Indianapolis suburb of Greenfield Thursday, The New York Times reported. “We knew it was a when, not if,” Greenfield-Central Community School Corporation Superintendent Harold Olin told the newspaper, admitting he was “very shocked it was on Day 1.”
Olin told local news station WXIN-TV that when school officials received word of a positive case, administrators put their plan into action. “We immediately pull that student from class,” Olin told WXIN. “We isolate them in a specific place in the clinic. Get the kid home.”
The school then started trying to nail down who the affected student had come into contact with, later requiring those children to quarantine for 14 days. “There’s no way that you can completely keep that out of a school corporation with 4,400 kids, or even if you have 300 kids in a school,” Olin told WXIN. “You’re likely going to have it at some point.”
Indiana reported 67,857 positive cases and 2,775 deaths related to COVID-19 as of Sunday. Although that pales in comparison to states like California, in which Los Angeles County alone reported 190,857 confirmed cases and 4,669 related deaths, the numbers haven’t led to widespread support for a return to school in Indiana.
In Greenfield, which has a population of about 23,000 people, coronavirus cases have remained “relatively high” since they began to “spike” in mid- June, The New York Times reported. Russell Wiley, a history teacher at Greenfield-Central High School, told the newspaper he “most definitely” felt like his school wasn’t ready to reopen. “Really, our whole state’s not ready,” he said. “We don’t have the virus under control. It’s just kind of like pretending like it’s not there.”
The district gave parents an option to have their children start virtually or attend classes, and only 15% chose remote learning. Patricia Woods told WXIN her family is part of that minority. “… Not only are you risking your family but you’re risking everybody else’s family as well. It’s just not worth it,” she said.
An unidentified father at Greenfield-Central Junior High told The New York Times few people wear masks in his community but faced with at least a one-hour commute to work each day, he felt sending his daughter back to school was the better option. “It’s just a mess,” he said. “I don’t know what the answers are.”
Indianapolis Public Schools was planning to reopen schools Monday but instead decided to push back its start date to Aug. 17 following the spike in coronavirus cases, according to The Indianapolis Star. “As I’ve acknowledged all along, this is a fluid situation and we will remain flexible,” Superintendent Aleesia Johnson said. “My job as superintendent is to look at all of the data from state and local health and government officials to make the best decision for our students and staff about the new school year. The decision to delay the opening of school by two weeks gives our community more time to ensure we are turning the tide on the number of positive COVID-19 cases and confirm we are doing the right thing.”

Under Donald Trump, our country has been reduced to a laughingstock, a curiosity, and a pitiable mess. All of that is on display in this video from The New York Times. If you don’t feel like watching the whole thing, at the very least skip ahead to 6:05 to see just how much sympathy the world has for us — trapped as we are on Asshole Island.

This is America. That used to mean something. No longer.
Our only chance to recapture our status and earn back the respect of the world is to elect Joe Biden. There is simply no other option.
Make it so.

Steve Daines — while he was writing a law to award them federal funds,"Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, who faces a tough re-election fight this year, received thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical companies while pushing Congress to fund a fast-tracked coronavirus treatment and vaccine development program that eventually awarded contracts to those companies, Federal Election Commission records show.
The $10 billion program, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, was Daines’ marquee contribution to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which President Trump signed into law on March 27.
In the days and weeks that Daines worked on the bill, PACs affiliated with the pharmaceutical corporations Pfizer and Sanofi gave his campaign $2,500 and $2,000, respectively. Four days before Trump signed the act, a Merck corporate PAC gave Daines $4,000.
In total, from the end of March to the end of June, Daines took a combined $24,000 from the corporate PACs of pharmaceutical companies involved with Operation Warp Speed.
In addition to Merck, Sanofi and Pfizer — which made two donations — Daines saw contributions from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, who in late June contributed $2,500 and $3,000, respectively.
While all these companies donated to senators and candidates on both sides of the aisle, these contributions are notable in that AstraZeneca tripled its other donations to Daines, and Johnson & Johnson had never given him money before.
All donors were among the six finalists chosen as finalists for Warp Speed contracts in June.
For reasons that are still unclear, these pharmaceutical PACs all but stopped donations entirely through the month of April, before resuming in late May.
Operation Warp Speed was created as part of a “moonshot” joint public-private effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine by early 2021. The federal government announced Friday that it had reached a $2.1 billion agreement with drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi — a Daines donor — the largest contract awarded through the program yet. The week before, Pfizer, another Daines donor, won a contract worth nearly $2 billion.
Daines promoted the project as recently as last week, boasting about the initiative at a Senate Finance Committee hearing last Wednesday, along with legislation to bring drug manufacturing back to the U.S. from China.
In total, the Montana Republican has accepted nearly $140,000 from pharmaceutical companies over the years, FEC records show. Those companies have little to no presence in Montana.
Daines’ 2018 financial disclosure form, the most recent available, shows that he has a Vanguard Health Care Adm Mutual Fund valued as much as $250,000. That fund includes slices of Teva and Amneal, pharmaceutical corporations that have promoted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, despite health warnings from federal regulators.
That same financial disclosure also reveals that Daines owns several parcels of commercial real estate in Bozeman, Montana. One of his tenants there is Golden Helix, a company that makes genome-sequencing analytics software — key to vaccine and drug development — which received between $350,000 and $2 million in CARES Act small business loans. The company says it counts nine of American’s 10 largest pharmaceutical companies as customers.
In the first quarter of 2020, pharmaceutical companies Sanofi, Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca reported spending more than $6.6 million to lobby Congress on various issues, including the CARES Act and COVID-19.
Congressional oversight bodies and watchdogs have expressed concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding the award of vaccine contracts under Operation Warp Speed.
Daines will face current Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, in November. Trump took the state by 20 points in 2016, but Montana has a record of electing Democrats in statewide races while favoring national Republicans. Recent polls show Bullock and Daines neck-and-neck, and Roll Call currently considers the race one of four “toss-ups” in the U.S. Senate.
The Daines campaign did not reply to Salon’s request for comment.

While it is unclear if the president was attempting to distract from the economy in freefall or his falling poll numbers.
Historian and expert on authoritarian regimes, Professor Timothy Snyder, authored of On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century, describing the key ways to spot authoritarianism.
“Do we have any reason to believe that Mr. Trump would accept the outcome of the election?” asked the Yale professor. “The tweet of July 30th was a very clear statement, but he has literally, dozens of times before said he wouldn’t. There is nothing in his career that indicates he actually likes democracy. In this particular tweet, we have a dangerous mixture, where he’s talking about a problem he created himself, insofar as we do have problems with voting in the U.S. They have to do with things like African-Americans not being enfranchised, they have to do with the things of foreign intervention. And even the problems he mentioned, which is postal voting, which is good and of itself, that might be slowed down because of his own postmaster general. So, he’s talking about problems he caused himself, then claiming they’re an emergency, and using that as a reason to claim power himself. That’s a manufactured emergency and that is, in fact, a prime historical fascist tactic.”
He went on to explain that a fascist is someone who will often manufacture a crisis, blame it on the other side, and then use the crisis to his own benefit. In Trump’s case, vote-by-mail has become the enemy as Republicans continue to defund the post office and Republicans in several states were caught in absentee-voter crimes.
Snyder said that Trump has already manufactured his crisis and is now trying to create the solution that would best protect him and his power.
“Another element of this, which is worth paying attention to, is the way the tweet ends,” he continued. “People can console themselves by saying Mr. Trump can’t himself cancel the election. That’s true, but what he is doing, as of July 30th, is calling upon others to create a mess, so that the election won’t go through smoothly. That’s what the three question marks at the end mean. He can’t do it himself.”
As of the time Trump sent that tweet, Snyder said that anyone who continues to support Trump knows they are doing so in defiance of democratic values of America.
“As of July 30th, if you support Mr. Trump, if you’re planning on voting for Mr. Trump, if you contribute to the campaign, if you’re a delegate, you know perfectly well, this is a man who doesn’t believe he can win by the normal vote count,” said Snyder. “You know you are taking part now in a campaign which is no longer a democratic campaign, but which is something else. You know that his main task for you now is not to win an election. He’s basically conceded defeat already. His main task for you now is to find someone who can mess up the election so we can cling to power. I think that’s a big moral question where a lot of Americans should be thinking about the choices they’re about to make.”

0,2020-08-02T17:27:04+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/a-weakened-trump-desperately-tries-to-preserve-his-delusions-of-grandeur/,A weakened Trump desperately tries to preserve his delusions of grandeur,"An enfeebled Donald Trump made a desperate bid this week to snatch victory from the jaws of electoral defeat. Baselessly impugning mail-in voting as a drag on election integrity, Trump offered, “Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???”
Not only does Trump lack the constitutional authority to do anything of the sort, no one was going for it. Not the pro-Trump co-founder of the ultra conservative Federalist Society, Steven Calabresi, who called it grounds for “immediate impeachment.” Not the Wall Street Journal editorial board, which suggested that perhaps Trump should scrap his reelection bid and “let someone run who isn’t looking for an excuse to blame for defeat.” And even some vulnerable Senate Republicans up for reelection this cycle managed to part ways with Trump on something for basically the first time ever.
In case you missed it, Trump is now at the weakest point of his presidency. Facing electoral doom and threatening to sink the GOP with him, some Republicans smell freedom and are breaking out the pitchforks early.
After Trump’s ‘delay’ trial balloon drew a legion of arrows, he was back Thursday afternoon to assure Americans that we “must know Election results on the night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!” No, we must not. Hopefully, we will know the result of the presidential contest that night, but there’s nothing constitutionally imperative about getting immediate results.
What is true is that the longer the results are delayed, the longer Trump will have to sow the seeds of doubt in Americans’ minds about the election’s integrity. Trump voters are already predisposed to refusing to accept the results of November’s election, with 55% of respondents in a Yahoo/YouGov survey saying they would not accept a close election result if Biden wins due to “an advantage in mail-in votes.” And Trump is already very actively laying the groundwork for that skepticism to take hold, with a particular focus on “mail-in voting,” which is the same as absentee voting even though Trump likes to pretend there’s some meaningful distinction.
“With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,” Trump wrote in his deranged “delay” tweet.
As the Washington Post reported Thursday, Trump has “attacked mail voting nearly 70 times since late March in interviews, remarks and tweets, including at least 17 times this month.” Naturally mail-in/absentee voting are also the safest way for Americans to vote amid the pandemic.
But pre-doubting the election results isn’t just a strategy for Trump, it’s also a psychological necessity for someone who’s entire persona and sense of self-worth is delicately balanced on a mythical house of cards. Trump’s whole adult existence has been nothing but a deceptive smoke-and-mirrors fabrication aimed at convincing others of his greatness. But along the way, Trump fell for his own delusions of grandeur, and now it’s imperative to his being that he safeguard them at all costs. Losing fair and square simply isn’t an option for someone who’s convinced himself he’s a “killer,” a term he inherited from his sociopathic father, Fred Trump.
So when Trump charges that he’s been “very unfairly treated” from the get-go, the media never gives him enough credit, the “fake” polls are undercounting his voters, the “silent majority” will have its say in November, and that a “fixed” and “rigged” election has already been stolen out from under him, it’s all of a piece—a function of self-preservation for a man who’s impervious to any reality that undercuts his supposed supremacy.
None of this is to say we should dismiss the strategic side of Trump’s persistent “fraud” push. He is pumping the ether full of toxicity about what he’s already declared “the greatest election disaster in history.” And it’s surely not beyond Republican lawmakers to survey the post-Election Day GOP ruins and decide, yeah, why not back Trump’s bid to steal the election? Without him, there’s nothing left of us.
We must make certain it’s perfectly clear that Americans won’t stand for his betrayal of our Constitution, our democratic ideals, and our republic. Trump has made perfectly clear for years that he would like to be “president for life” and, given all the investigations awaiting him if he loses, he has more incentive than ever to barricade himself in the White House. As American-Russian journalist Masha Gessen told MSNBC’s Joy Reid Friday, “the question of whether he can is really a question of how many enablers he has?” The People must provide a convincing counterbalance to those enablers.
But if Joe Biden wins, it won’t matter whether it’s a narrow victory or an emphatic rout, Donald Trump will go to his grave believing he was harassed as a candidate, wronged throughout his presidency, and robbed of reelection. When the truth is, he cheated his way into office and spent four years taking everything America was worth and burning it like Monopoly money, just like he did with his daddy’s fortune. Too bad Fred Trump won’t be around to bail out the country.

0,2020-08-02T17:23:23+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/gop-congressman-reprimanded-for-11-ethics-violations-including-fake-loan-he-made-to-his-campaign/,GOP congressman reprimanded for 11 ethics violations — including fake loan he made to his campaign,"Republican Rep. David Schweikert agreed to pay a $50,000 fine, accept a formal reprimand, and admit to 11 different violations of congressional rules and campaign finance laws in a deal with the bipartisan House Ethics Committee to conclude its two-year-long investigation of the congressman. But while the matter may now officially be closed, Schweikert’s already uncertain political future is now only more endangered.
The Ethics Committee’s wide-ranging findings fell into four categories: (1) “campaign finance violations and reporting errors”; (2) spending government money to support Schweikert’s political campaigns; (3) pressuring government staff to perform campaign work; and (4) Schweikert’s “lack of candor and due diligence in the course of the investigation.”
A special subcommittee convened to carry out the inquiry determined in its own lengthy report that Schweikert had failed to disclose at least $370,000 in campaign donations, expenditures, and loans between 2010 and 2017, and had used at least $1,500 in campaign funds for “impermissible personal purposes.” It also found that Schweikert had falsely claimed he loaned his campaign $100,000 on Christmas Day in 2011, then later made up five fictitious payments to a consulting firm that wound up totaling the same amount in order to get his books to balance.
Why lie like this? At the time, Schweikert was on a collision course with fellow GOP Rep. Ben Quayle, since redistricting made it likely that both would try to seek reelection in the same district. Schweikert had immediately announced his intention to run in the 6th District as soon as new maps were announced in October of 2011, but Quayle dithered, so Schweikert almost certainly inflated his cash-on-hand figures with his fake loan in order to deter Quayle from opposing him. It didn’t work, as Quayle eventually decided to go head-to-head with Schweikert, but Schweikert wound up narrowly winning their primary, 51-49.
This sort of scam was in fact an ongoing occurrence, according to the Ethics Committee. Schweikert’s chief of staff, Oliver Schwab, regularly made outlays on behalf of the congressman’s campaign committee that ultimately totaled $270,000, and Schweikert would delay reimbursing Schwab in order to again pad his cash balance on his fundraising reports. He later would conceal repayments to his aide by listing the recipient as Schwab’s consulting company.
It was Schwab’s behavior, in fact, that helped spur the investigation that ultimately led to Thursday’s settlement. In the fall of 2017, the conservative Washington Examiner published a report alleging that Schwab had taken a trip from D.C. to Arizona for Super Bowl weekend in 2015 that was paid for by taxpayers but included non-official activities, such as a Schweikert fundraiser. The Ethics Committee agreed the use of public funds for this trip was improper, though Schwab had already repaid the U.S. Treasury, leading the panel to conclude that “no further steps are required.”
Schwab was also at the center of investigators’ findings of improper pressure placed on congressional staff to assist Schweikert’s campaigns. The committee determined that Schweikert himself “regularly pressured” Schwab to perform campaign work, especially fundraising, and that Schwab in turn pushed other aides to help raise money. One unnamed former staffer charged that Schwab had told him he “would need to take a 40 percent pay cut and his performance would be judged on fundraising,” an accusation Schwab did not deny. Schweikert’s “lax oversight” of his own office, said the committee, was a violation of House rules because of the atmosphere it created.
Schweikert had a similarly laissez-faire attitude about telling the truth during the course of the Ethics Committee’s investigation. The subcommittee’s report says the congressman made “misleading” statements, took inordinately long to produce documents, and “made statements that could not be reconciled with the evidence” during his interview with investigators, for which he had come “ill-prepared.” The full committee’s briefer report concluded that Schweikert’s dilatory behavior “allowed him to evade the statute of limitations for the most egregious violations of campaign finance laws”—actions that “were themselves sanctionable misconduct.”
Perhaps the only good news for Schweikert in all this is that he can finally stop hemorrhaging cash to his attorneys: His campaign had spent at least $1.1 million in legal fees as of mid-July. But now his Democratic opponent in the November general election—likely physician Hiral Tipirneni—will be able to blast out ads reminding voters that their congressman admitted to almost a dozen ethical violation, paid a huge fine, and was formally sanctioned by the House.
And if Tipirneni wins next week’s primary, she’ll definitely have the funds to do so. While Schweikert’s campaign balance stands at a meager $230,000 thanks to all those expensive lawyers, Tipirneni is sitting on a giant stockpile of $1.3 million.
Schweikert is also facing an electorate that’s grown increasingly hostile to the GOP: While Mitt Romney carried Arizona’s 6th District—well-educated and relatively affluent turf in the Phoenix suburbs—by a hefty 60-39 margin, Donald Trump only won it 52-42, and Republican Martha McSally prevailed just 51-47 in her unsuccessful Senate bid in 2018. Given the district’s demographics, it’s far more likely than not that this leftward trend is still underway.
It’s quite an irony: Schweikert engaged in all of this skulduggery in order to help him win his past elections. Now it can only help him lose his next one.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) played to the cameras Friday morning as he bullied, belittled, and attacked Dr. Anthony Fauci during a House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee hearing on the coronavirus crisis.
Jordan tried to politicize the immunologist and public health official’s testimony – and tried get Fauci, who has served for decades as the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), to say that the federal government should shut down the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests under the guise of combatting the pandemic.
“Do protests increase the spread of the virus?” Jordan pointedly asked.
“Crowding particularly when you’re not wearing a mask contributes to the spread of the virus,” Fauci replied.
“Should we limit the protesting?” Jordan pressed.
Stunned, Fauci responded.
Fauci repeated the question, offering to “make a general statement,” but Jordan immediately interrupted him after the doctor had spoken just 15 words.
“Half a million protestors on June 6 alone,” Jordan declared.
“I’m not sure – how do you mean? Should we limit the protesting?”
Jordan, insisting a public health official weigh in on a specific event and a specific legal issue, shot back with a terse and angry answer: “Should government limit the protesting?”
This is a question not for Fauci but for legal experts. Jordan could have asked the question another way, say, “Should the government limit outside events of more than 500 people?” But he didn’t want an answer, he wanted the television footage.
The attack went on for at least two minutes. Ultimately Chairman James Clyburn was forced to intervene.

Many on social media were furious – and only too happy to remind Americans that allegations by numerous of his former college wrestlers have never been resolved.
JIM JORDAN: Dr. Fauci, do you believe wrestlers should be molested. Hey who put this question in here.
FAUCI: No. They shouldn’t. And if you see that happen you should say something.

Why is it Fauci’s role to say whether or not the government should forcibly stop civil rights protests? Do you even know wha Fauci’s job is?

And the Democrats are missing the critical point. This virus spreads more easily and more readily when people are inside than when they are outside. He is complaining about protests which are outside while everything he wants to be opened is inside

0,2020-08-02T13:32:41+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/heres-what-the-faithless-electors-decision-says-about-scotus-and-originalism/,Here’s what the faithless electors decision says about SCOTUS and originalism,"The outcome of Chiafalo v. Washington (a unanimous decision that states may compel presidential electors to cast votes for the candidate to which they are pledged-ed.) was a foregone conclusion. In this troubling time, SCOTUS was not about to upend our system of selecting a president. To achieve the desired result, however, the justices were forced to turn the clear intent of the Framers on its head. This does not mean they made the wrong call; it simply shows us, point blank, that originalism is no more than a pragmatic tool, to be used or ignored at will.
The opinion of the Court, delivered by Justice Kagan, states correctly that the system of presidential electors “emerged from an eleventh-hour compromise.” But neither the Court, nor the concurring opinion penned by Justice Thomas, tells us why compromise was required. While Kagan and Thomas quarreled over the Framers’ use of the term “manner,”neither discussed the competing views or warring factions—nor why the Framers, in the end, opted for this convoluted, untested resolution to the heated debate over presidential selection. Any originalist would eagerly explore such promising territory; no justice did, not even the self-proclaimed originalists.
Here’s the backstory:
The Virginia Plan, the Convention’s opening foray, called for “a national Executive … to be chosen by the national Legislature.” That made sense. Under the Articles of Confederation, all the nation’s business was conducted by committees of Congress or boards it appointed, but that had proved highly inefficient. In the new plan, Congress would select a distinct executive to implement its laws. (Not until mid-summer did the Framers dub this executive “President.”)
A few delegates, however, preferred greater separation between the legislative and executive branches of government; they didn’t want the executive to be totally beholden to Congress. But when James Wilson proposed that the executive be selected by the people, several of his colleagues balked. “It would be as unnatural to refer the choice of a proper chief Magistrate to the people,” George Mason pronounced, “as it would, to refer a trial of colours to a blind man.” Most agreed with Elbridge Gerry, who held that “the evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy,” and with Roger Sherman, who proclaimed, “The people immediately should have as little to do as may be about the government. They want information and are constantly liable to be misled.” Rebuffed, Wilson then suggested that the people choose special electors, and this elite crew would select the “Executive Magistracy.” This option also fared poorly. On June 2, by a vote of eight states to two, the Convention affirmed that the national Executive would be chosen by the national Legislature.
Twice more popular election was proposed and turned down. In mid-July, Gouverneur Morris convinced the Convention to opt for special electors, but four days later five states that had favored electors reversed their votes; Congress would choose the Executive, as originally suggested. That is how matters stood until the waning days of August. Then, by a devious maneuver, Gouverneur Morris managed to refer the matter to a committee charged with taking up unsettled issues—even though the manner of selection had been discussed several times and settled. There, in committee, the system we now call the “Electoral College” was written into the Constitution.
The Committee reported out on September 4, less than two weeks before the Convention would adjourn. Morris, a member, presented “the reasons of the Committee and his own.” “Immediate choice by the people” was not acceptable, while “appointment by the Legislature” would lead to “intrigue and faction.” The committee’s ingenious elector system, on the other hand, depoliticized the process. “As the Electors would vote at the same time throughout the U. S. and at so great a distance from each other, the great evil of cabal was avoided,” he explained. Under such conditions, it would be “impossible” for any cabal to “corrupt” the electors.
Hamilton, in Federalist 68, sold this notion to the public: “Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption,. … The convention have guarded against all danger of this sort with the most provident and judicious attention.” Voting separately and independently, “under circumstances favorable to deliberation,” electors would “enter upon the task free from any sinister bias.” Further, to guard against political interference, the Constitution stated that “no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.” This argument addressed the concerns of those who had opposed congressional selection.
Those who had opposed popular election of the Executive were also pacified. Madison, for example, believed the people should elect their representatives to the lower house of Congress, but selection of senators, judges, and the president should be “refined” by “successive filtrations,” keeping the people at some remove from their government. The elector system did exactly that: people choose their state legislatures, these bodies determine how to choose electors, and the electors choose the president—a most thorough “filtration.” During the debates over ratification, Anti-Federalists complained about this. A New York writer calling himself Cato wrote, “It is a maxim in republics, that the representative of the people should be of their immediate choice; but by the manner in which the president is chosen he arrives to this office at the fourth or fifth hand.” Republicus, from Kentucky, commented wryly, “An extraordinary refinement this, on the plain simple business of election; and of which the grand convention have certainly the honour of being the first inventors.”
Both arguments presented by the Framers were based on the premise that electors, chosen for their greater wisdom and free to act independently, were best positioned to choose the president. It didn’t work out that way. Political parties quickly gamed the system, leading to the fiascos of 1796 and 1800. The Twelfth Amendment addressed one flaw in the scheme by requiring separate votes for the president and vice president, but it did not change the fundamental structure. To this day, we remain saddled with a system devised to shield selection of the president from politics and the people.
That was then, and this is now—an unpleasant truth for originalists. A Court composed of faithful originalists would have decided Chiafalo v. Washington unanimously in favor of the rebel electors, who insisted on maintaining their Constitutionally-guaranteed independence. Fortunately, there are no true originalists on the Court. Yet that does raise troubling questions:
Did the Court’s professed originalists consciously ignore the historical context for presidential electors, too embarrassed by the Framers’ distrust of democracy and their inability to foresee the system’s basic flaws? Or did they not understand the textual record, which makes that context clear? Neither alternative is acceptable. Any standard of jurisprudence must be applied evenly and knowledgeably, or it is no standard at all.

0,2020-08-02T13:25:15+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/rnc-announces-convention-press-ban-one-day-after-trump-encounters-yet-another-tiny-crowd-in-florida/,RNC announces convention press ban — one day after Trump encounters yet another tiny crowd in Florida,"The latest modification to the ever-changing Republican National Convention is one that seems to cater to the incumbent seeking re-election, and his endless war on the media: The entire four-day event will be closed to members of the press, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.
Conveniently blaming the novel coronavirus, which a near-endless stream of Republicans have continued to minimize, an unnamed Grand Old Party spokesperson attempted to shift responsibility for the decision to the government of North Carolina. “[W]e are planning for all of the Charlotte activities to be closed press: Friday, August 21—Monday, 24th given the health restrictions and limitations in place in the state,” the email read, adding that “we are working within the parameters set before us by state and local guidelines regarding the number of people who can attend events.”
Press will also be unwelcome in “the room when the Republican National Committee meets to conduct official party business,” the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Unless Republicans change their plans, this rejection of the Fourth Estate from the convention is a pretty big deal. In fact, it’s the first time journalists have been barred from a Republican presidential nominating convention, ever. Donald Trump—also known as the guy getting the Republican nomination—has declared the press to be an “enemy” of the American people, and for months has minimized the dangers of the novel coronavirus. He’s also the guy who hasn’t been drawing huge adoring crowds, long considered more essential to his survival than even Big Macs. Balloons and streamers dropping on an all-but-empty arena—and caught on camera for the world to see, and share, and replay—would likely be more than Trump can take. Even before the ban on reporters, the RNC reduced the amount of delegates welcome to just 336, down from over 2,400 in 2016.

“Suburban districts … have long been critical bases of Republican support, packed with affluent white voters who reliably chose Republicans to represent them in Congress,” reported Emily Cochrane and Catie Edmondson. “Democrats seized control of the House in 2018 by making inroads in communities like these, and Republicans have tied their hopes of reclaiming power to preserving their remaining footholds there. But as Mr. Trump continues to stumble in his response to the pandemic and seeks to stir up racist fears with pledges to preserve the ‘Suburban Lifestyle Dream,’ such districts are slipping further from the party’s grasp, and threatening to drag down congressional Republicans in November’s elections.”
Two of these longtime Republican voters are Cass and Samantha Madison, who live in Sugar Land, Texas, just outside of Houston and plan to vote for Democratic foreign service officer Sri Kulkarni for Congress in an open Republican seat. “The lack of accountability kills me,” said Samantha, noting the GOP’s “very poor handling” of the coronavirus pandemic “from top to bottom.”
Another disaffected Sugar Land Republican is attorney Farha Ahmed. “The megaphone is really with the president and that is what has translated to all the Texas Republican leaders,” she complained. “It makes it very difficult for them to carry out what they need to do for health and safety reasons.”
“I have always been a mostly straight-ticket voter — I don’t think I will be this coming election,” said a Cypress, Texas Republican, Wade Miller, who is losing confidence in GOP Rep. Michael McCaul. “We’re talking about human lives here, and if people aren’t willing to do what it takes to save lives, what else aren’t they willing to do? I will definitely be changing my vote come November.”

“In the middle of this pandemic they’re playing with us,” said Candida Kevorkian, a 53-year-old California woman relying on the payments to survive, told the Washington Post Saturday.
The benefits are credited with keeping the economy from a complete collapse due to the ongoing nationwide Covid-19 outbreak and staving off a wave of evictions many advocates fear is coming now that the weekly infusion is gone. But the initial program, passed in the CARES Act in late March, only ran until the end of July.
House Democrats approved the HEROES Act, a $3 trillion stimulus package which included an extension of the unemployment benefit boost, in late May, but GOP lawmakers in the Senate, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), took no action on the bill, instead presenting a competing bill known as the HEALS Act last month that cut the payment to $200 a week. That legislation was dead on arrival, however, not even generating necessary support within the caucus due to the level of spending.
The White House and the GOP Senate leadership floated a one-week extension for the benefits, but that fix—such as it is—was rejected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) Thursday evening.
“We recognize the gravity of the situation,” Pelosi told reporters Friday. “They don’t.”
Sounds like some progress on negotiations today. Here’s what Mnuchin told reporters is in the mix, specifics unclear:
— Fix on UI
— Eviction moratorium
— PPP $
— Schools/childcare $
— Cites McConnell demand on liability
Unemployment $ and eviction moratorium already expired
— Jeff Stein (@JStein_WaPo) August 1, 2020
Negotiations are, reportedly, ongoing—but the Republican-led Senate nonetheless adjourned for the weekend on Thursday.
Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) told MSNBC Friday night the choice to leave town was “inexplicable” and urged his GOP colleagues to negotiate a workable solution to the ongoing crisis with House Democrats.
“I hear senators making $175,000 a year complaining that these ‘lazy workers are getting so much money,'” said Brown. “People haven’t sunk into poverty in significant numbers at all during this pandemic because of the $600 a week.”
The fix is simple, 38-year-old New Haven, Connecticut resident Raven Holmes told the Post.
“Money is not a resource that can be depleted. It’s a man-made thing,” said Holmes. “If you need more make more.”
“There are other countries—their citizens are fine, nobody is suffering, and everybody is healthy,” she added. “All our government wants is money in their pockets, while the people are poor and starving and scrounging.”

The report notes that Pennsylvania was key to the president’s 2016 election when he became the first Republican presidential nominee to carry the state since 1988.
This time around the same people who carried him to victory — voters 65 and older and those who live in the suburbs — are deserting him droves because he can’t get them to buy into his attacks on Biden and he has the baggage of three and a half years of failures including the coronavirus health crisis and a faltering economy weighing him down.
Noting the president has trailed Biden in every head-to-head poll in the state — with the Democratic nominee now sitting on a 6 point lead according to the Real Clear Politics poll average — one local Democrats claimed that Trump’s can’t seem to “juice” up his voters with less than one hundred days before the election.
“Hating Joe Biden doesn’t juice up their base and their Fox News viewers the way going after Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and AOC do,” Rep. Brendan Boyle (D) explained. “You can make certain assumptions and wonder why that is. Is gender a factor? Is race a factor? I don’t know. I have certain suspicions.”
As Politico notes, Biden also has a home-turf advantage.
According to Democratic officials, “Biden is also being buoyed by the fact that he is a Scranton native and former Delaware senator who was covered by the Philadelphia media network for years. And they said that Biden doesn’t anger GOP or swing voters like Clinton — instead, he’s a moderate white man who rarely makes waves in a state that has elected more than its fair share of milquetoast white male politicians.”
“In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes by taking a path that defied expectations: He won blue-collar, often traditionally Democratic areas in northeastern and northwestern Pennsylvania, surged in rural regions, and performed poorly in the moderate Philadelphia suburbs. Overall, he carried suburban voters by 8 points and seniors by 10 points in the state, according to exit polls,” the report states before adding, “A July FOX poll of Pennsylvania found Biden leading Trump by 26 points among suburban voters and 7 points among seniors. Other surveys show a closer race, such as a CNBC/Change Research poll that had Biden ahead in the state by 2 points.”

0,2020-08-02T12:18:15+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/in-a-rare-move-republicans-tell-president-trump-no/,"In a rare move, Republicans tell President Trump ‘no’","In a rare moment in the Trump era, several Texas Republicans pushed back against President Donald Trump on Thursday when he floated in a tweet the idea of delaying the presidential election in November. The president does not have the legal authority to move Election Day; that power resides with Congress.
Trump’s tweet came just 16 minutes after the U.S. Commerce Department released data showing the nation’s gross domestic product had fallen 33% in the second quarter of 2020. In it, he said, “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???!”
Like voter fraud overall, examples of fraudulent voting using mail-in ballots remain rare. And there’s no difference between mail-in voting and absentee voting, despite the framing in the tweet.
Democrats and Republicans respond
Democrats have long worried that Trump would move in that direction. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s Democratic rival, predicted as much in April. “Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held,” he said at the time. “That’s the only way he thinks he can possibly win.”
Republicans, however, were privately stunned. Publicly, a cascade of Texas GOP officeholders pushed back against the president’s suggestion.
Most notably, the state’s junior senator — who devoted much of his childhood years studying the Constitution — responded immediately. CNN quoted U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz as saying that, while election fraud is a “serious problem” that needs to be fought, “the election should not be delayed.”
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn downplayed the president’s remark.
“I think it’s a joke, I guess, I don’t know how else to interpret it,” he told reporters. “Obviously he doesn’t have the power to do that.
“So, I mean, so, all you guys in the press, your heads will explode and you’ll write about it. I don’t know what his motivation is. He can’t do it,” he said.
There are few documented cases of absentee voting fraud in Texas in recent years, representing a minuscule sample in a state where millions of legitimate votes are cast in every general election. The Texas Legislature has taken action to reduce the likelihood of fraud even further. In 2017, state lawmakers passed a measure to widen the definition of mail-in ballot fraud, boost penalties for certain offenses and strengthen rules for signature verification on those ballots. The legislation, which Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law, also requires local election officials to notify voters when their ballots are rejected and limits who can assist voters using the vote-by-mail option.
Abbott asserted the integrity of the Texas election system in a statement. “Texas has adopted procedures and guidelines to ensure safe and fair elections, including extending the early in-person voting period, and the elections in Texas will occur on November 3rd,” he said.
In the House, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, pressed his Republican colleagues to clarify where they stood on the issue.
“An urgent question for every Republican officeholder and candidate: Do you support President Trump’s unconstitutional effort to postpone the November election for the first time in American history in order to continue his march to tyranny?” Doggett tweeted early Thursday.
“No, it’s not even a question. No delays. We should demand safe and secure elections. If you requested an absentee ballot, you should use it. And states should not use universal mail-in, which is indeed vulnerable to mistakes and abuse,” U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, tweeted in response to Trump.
GOP state legislators also weighed in.
“No sir. @realDonaldTrump this is not even up for discussion,” tweeted state Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler.
“We must do all we can to ensure election integrity. Absolutely. But, no way we should entertain delaying the election. Should not even be up for discussion,” tweeted state Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth.
State Rep. Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, responded to Trump’s tweet with a GIF that read, “That’s not how this works! That’s not how any of this works!”
Privately, Texas Republicans expressed more pointed astonishment and worry that the president’s comments reinforced Democratic charges that Trump is trying to unduly influence the election. One exasperated Texas GOP delegation staffer compared the moment to World War II and noted that even then, the country was able to conduct elections.
Can Trump legally delay Election Day? 
Setting the date for Election Day is not within the presidential powers. The Constitution empowers Congress to set the election date. That tradition stretches back to 1845, when Congress first established that Election Day would be the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November in every fourth year.
Elections are overseen by state officials but mostly run by local election officers who are responsible for managing polling places and counting votes. Their responsibilities include fielding applications from absentee voters and processing those ballots.
Democrats and civil rights organizations openly fear that statements like the one Trump made Thursday will undermine the legitimacy of the November election, when an increased number of voters are expected to vote by mail during the pandemic.
“Suggesting the possibility of moving the General Election is an extraordinary statement from a sitting President and is sure to create confusion amongst voters about presidential powers in relation to the election,” Trevor Potter, president of Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement. “The country has voted in general elections in the middle of a Civil War, two World Wars and the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, not to mention the Great Depression.”
While universal mail-in voting has been in use in other states for many years, absentee voting is typically lightly used in Texas. People who are registered to vote in Texas must meet strict eligibility criteria to apply for a ballot they can fill out at home and mail in. The option is generally reserved for voters who are 65 and older, those who cite a disability or an illness, and those who will be out of the county they’re registered in during the election period.
As voters grapple with the risks that could come from casting their ballots in person, the pandemic has ushered in a growing debate over whether to expand the parameters of who qualifies to vote absentee. In other states that also require voters to present an “excuse” to obtain a mail-in ballot, Democratic and Republican officials have either moved to expand absentee voting due to the pandemic or allowed voters to use the coronavirus as a reason to vote by mail during the upcoming elections. Texas’ Republican leaders, by contrast, have refused to budge on the issue and have successfully fought off efforts by state Democrats and civil rights groups to force an expansion through the courts.

“In their launch manifesto, published as a column in the New York Times, the founders said their goal was ‘defeating President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box’, including his Republican supporters in Congress,” reported Richard Wolffe. “To that end, they said their efforts were about “persuading enough disaffected conservatives, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in swing states and districts” to defeat Trump and elect congressional majorities opposed to Trumpism.”
According to executive director Sarah Lenti, one of the ways this is accomplished is by sharing testimonials from anti-Trump Republicans up and down the ballot, who GOP voters respect and listen to — in the hope that just enough of them will be persuaded against Trump to cost him the election. But another big part of the strategy, she said, is to provoke Trump himself into melting down until the voters tire of him.
“Some of these ads have an audience of one,” she said. “That’s always been part of the strategy. Because every time he gets off message, spewing grievances, he’s not campaigning. The idea is to get him off message again and again and again. It bothers him. We hear from people inside the White House that he wants them to make us go away. But we’re not going away.”
This is part of why their ads, which target Trump on a personal level, air in Washington, D.C. — even though Democrats are assured to win the district, it ensures Trump will see the ads, and react to them.

Louie Gohmert’s history of spreading racist lies about immigrants and disease,"It’s unclear exactly how many people Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert has put at risk in very recent days after defiantly refusing to wear a mask around his House colleagues and then testing positive for COVID-19 (which he found out about only because he was scheduled to be within spitting distancing of impeached president Donald Trump). But it didn’t stop there: ABC News is among the media outlets that reported that Gohmert, apparently unaware of technology including email and texting, returned to his office to inform staff of his diagnosis.
”We can expect, then, that he has spread the virus to some significant extent,” we wrote earlier this week. News that Gohmert, hands-down one of the worst members of Congress, could be some sort of “super spreader” comes as Gohmert has a history of also spreading the racist lie that Central American children who have fled to the U.S. for safety are disease-ridden.
“In response to an influx of unaccompanied minors arriving in Texas in 2014, Rep. Gohmert suggested bringing in the Texas National Guard to ‘stop the invasion… [because] we don’t know what diseases they’re bringing in,’” said The Plot Against Immigrants, a project of Western States Center. Gohmert pushed this racist lie more than once, also claiming that U.S. schools would not be able to educate these children because “we don’t even know what all diseases they have,” Texas Observer reported at the time.
The “diseased immigrant” lie is a racist and tired one popular with Republicans like Gohmert. “Consider, for example, Guatemala,” Texas Observer reported at the time.
“According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Guatemalan kids are more likely than Texans to be immunized for most infectious diseases,” the report said. “Guatemala has universal health care. Vaccines are 100 percent funded by the government … By comparison, one in six kids in Texas is uninsured, and even insured families often must pay for vaccination.”
In fact, as Gohmert lies and claims kids fleeing to the U.S. are somehow bringing danger, it’s the current U.S. government that has created precedented dangers.
We know that migrant children have died under U.S. watch for the first time in many years. We know that even after children died under U.S. watch, border officials ignored a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to give detained kids and families flu shots. We also know that even as COVID-19 is hitting migrant family jails, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is refusing to release kids and their parents together.
According to the ABC News report, “Republican sources on Capitol Hill told ABC News that Gohmert’s full staff has been in the office in recent days and that, at times, staffers were chastised for wearing masks.” After testing positive, Gohmert then claimed that maybe it was wearing a mask that got him sick.

According to the report, in 2014, the Obama Administration signed a contract with Philips to add 10,000 ventilators to the nation’s stockpile by June 2019. Though Philips delayed the fulfillment until November 2019, had they been held to that deadline, the nation would have had plenty of ventilators for when the coronavirus epidemic started in March 2020.
However, the Trump Administration granted Philips three extensions.
“On January 21, 2020, when the first coronavirus case was reported in the United States,” the report states, “Philips approached the Trump Administration about accelerating the delivery of ventilators under its existing contract. The Trump Administration ignored this opportunity, and for six weeks, it did not respond to Philips’ offer.”
When Peter Navarro — Assistant to the President, Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy — and other senior officials in the White House negotiated a new contract with Philips, they ended up scrapping the Obama-era terms and agreed to pay almost five-times the price set under those terms.
While Philips had sold ventilators to other purchasers for prices as low as $9,327 per unit, the Trump Administration ended up paying $50,000 per unit.
“The documents show that the Administration accepted Philips’ first offer without even trying to negotiate a lower price,” the report reads.
The ventilators may arrive after a vaccine for the illness does. In the meanwhile, the U.S. has surpassed over 156,000 coronavirus deaths.
This revelation comes just a day after Vanity Fair revealed that the Trump White House scrapped a national testing plan for the epidemic, thinking that coronavirus would mostly kill of blue states voters and the administration could then blame Democratic governors for it.

0,2020-08-02T12:18:15+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/in-a-rare-move-republicans-tell-president-trump-no/,"In a rare move, Republicans tell President Trump ‘no’","In a rare moment in the Trump era, several Texas Republicans pushed back against President Donald Trump on Thursday when he floated in a tweet the idea of delaying the presidential election in November. The president does not have the legal authority to move Election Day; that power resides with Congress.
Trump’s tweet came just 16 minutes after the U.S. Commerce Department released data showing the nation’s gross domestic product had fallen 33% in the second quarter of 2020. In it, he said, “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???!”
Like voter fraud overall, examples of fraudulent voting using mail-in ballots remain rare. And there’s no difference between mail-in voting and absentee voting, despite the framing in the tweet.
Democrats and Republicans respond
Democrats have long worried that Trump would move in that direction. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s Democratic rival, predicted as much in April. “Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held,” he said at the time. “That’s the only way he thinks he can possibly win.”
Republicans, however, were privately stunned. Publicly, a cascade of Texas GOP officeholders pushed back against the president’s suggestion.
Most notably, the state’s junior senator — who devoted much of his childhood years studying the Constitution — responded immediately. CNN quoted U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz as saying that, while election fraud is a “serious problem” that needs to be fought, “the election should not be delayed.”
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn downplayed the president’s remark.
“I think it’s a joke, I guess, I don’t know how else to interpret it,” he told reporters. “Obviously he doesn’t have the power to do that.
“So, I mean, so, all you guys in the press, your heads will explode and you’ll write about it. I don’t know what his motivation is. He can’t do it,” he said.
There are few documented cases of absentee voting fraud in Texas in recent years, representing a minuscule sample in a state where millions of legitimate votes are cast in every general election. The Texas Legislature has taken action to reduce the likelihood of fraud even further. In 2017, state lawmakers passed a measure to widen the definition of mail-in ballot fraud, boost penalties for certain offenses and strengthen rules for signature verification on those ballots. The legislation, which Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law, also requires local election officials to notify voters when their ballots are rejected and limits who can assist voters using the vote-by-mail option.
Abbott asserted the integrity of the Texas election system in a statement. “Texas has adopted procedures and guidelines to ensure safe and fair elections, including extending the early in-person voting period, and the elections in Texas will occur on November 3rd,” he said.
In the House, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, pressed his Republican colleagues to clarify where they stood on the issue.
“An urgent question for every Republican officeholder and candidate: Do you support President Trump’s unconstitutional effort to postpone the November election for the first time in American history in order to continue his march to tyranny?” Doggett tweeted early Thursday.
“No, it’s not even a question. No delays. We should demand safe and secure elections. If you requested an absentee ballot, you should use it. And states should not use universal mail-in, which is indeed vulnerable to mistakes and abuse,” U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, tweeted in response to Trump.
GOP state legislators also weighed in.
“No sir. @realDonaldTrump this is not even up for discussion,” tweeted state Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler.
“We must do all we can to ensure election integrity. Absolutely. But, no way we should entertain delaying the election. Should not even be up for discussion,” tweeted state Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth.
State Rep. Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, responded to Trump’s tweet with a GIF that read, “That’s not how this works! That’s not how any of this works!”
Privately, Texas Republicans expressed more pointed astonishment and worry that the president’s comments reinforced Democratic charges that Trump is trying to unduly influence the election. One exasperated Texas GOP delegation staffer compared the moment to World War II and noted that even then, the country was able to conduct elections.
Can Trump legally delay Election Day? 
Setting the date for Election Day is not within the presidential powers. The Constitution empowers Congress to set the election date. That tradition stretches back to 1845, when Congress first established that Election Day would be the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November in every fourth year.
Elections are overseen by state officials but mostly run by local election officers who are responsible for managing polling places and counting votes. Their responsibilities include fielding applications from absentee voters and processing those ballots.
Democrats and civil rights organizations openly fear that statements like the one Trump made Thursday will undermine the legitimacy of the November election, when an increased number of voters are expected to vote by mail during the pandemic.
“Suggesting the possibility of moving the General Election is an extraordinary statement from a sitting President and is sure to create confusion amongst voters about presidential powers in relation to the election,” Trevor Potter, president of Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement. “The country has voted in general elections in the middle of a Civil War, two World Wars and the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, not to mention the Great Depression.”
While universal mail-in voting has been in use in other states for many years, absentee voting is typically lightly used in Texas. People who are registered to vote in Texas must meet strict eligibility criteria to apply for a ballot they can fill out at home and mail in. The option is generally reserved for voters who are 65 and older, those who cite a disability or an illness, and those who will be out of the county they’re registered in during the election period.
As voters grapple with the risks that could come from casting their ballots in person, the pandemic has ushered in a growing debate over whether to expand the parameters of who qualifies to vote absentee. In other states that also require voters to present an “excuse” to obtain a mail-in ballot, Democratic and Republican officials have either moved to expand absentee voting due to the pandemic or allowed voters to use the coronavirus as a reason to vote by mail during the upcoming elections. Texas’ Republican leaders, by contrast, have refused to budge on the issue and have successfully fought off efforts by state Democrats and civil rights groups to force an expansion through the courts.

0,2020-08-02T12:07:36+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trump-didnt-just-break-the-gop-he-broke-conservatism/,Trump didn’t just break the GOP — he broke conservatism,"Remember when you could all describe, in one succinct sentence, what the Republican Party was all about? “Family values, lower taxes, and a strong national defense.” Democrats spent decades trying to come up with their own pithy slogan and failed. We are just too diverse a coalition to condense into a single sentence. And turns out, we don’t need to, because the head of the conservative movement, Donald Trump, has exposed just how empty that statement of values always was.
It was quite the feat, actually, to take the one man with inarguably the worst record on “family values,” and then rally around him with zero sense of irony or shame. Trump had multiples and then cheated on them with pornstars while ignoring his children. He didn’t (and doesn’t) go to church, give to charity, or show any semblance of humility. In fact, he did the opposite of charity—he used a charity to grift.
In fact, has any one man ever embodied the seven deadly sins more perfectly than Trump? Pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, and sloth. He is a wretched human being, morally bankrupt and ethically corrupt. And through it all, evangelical Christians have stuck with him, proving that they never ever cared about any actual morality.
On national defense, Republicans have acknowledged that Trump is a puppet of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. The current House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy, a solid Trump ally, who was recorded saying back in 2017, “There’s …there’s two people, I think, Putin pays: [California Rep. Dana] Rohrabacher and Trump … [laughter] … swear to God.” Then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, another Republican, thought that was funny, ““This is an off-the-record … [laughter] … NO LEAKS … [laughter] … alright?!”
Hilarious.
We went through a whole impeachment process in which Trump’s attempts to enlist foreign governments to help his reelection campaign were fully exposed, and Republicans did nothing but shrug.
But nothing tops revelations that Russia paid Taliban fighters in Afghanistan a bounty for every dead American they killed, and Trump couldn’t be bothered to give a damn. Instead, Putin’s loyal lapdog keeps checking in with Moscow every month, to discuss who knows what. You’d think Republicans would care about America’s top historical geopolitical opponent encouraging the murder of our troops, but nah.
They did get to the “lower taxes” bit, however. Nothing like destroying our nation’s finances in order to justify the cutting of our social nets to really get Republicans excited. … Then again, “bailing out billionaires” isn’t particularly the most populist and popular policy plank on which to hang all your electoral hopes.
So we know that all of this has utterly crushed the GOP, and we’re headed toward another anti-Republican wave election this fall. But now we’re seeing evidence that this goes deeper than simple anti-GOP sentiment. By exposing its flimsy pretenses, Trump is breaking conservatism itself. Check out Gallup’s polling on self-identified ideology over the course of this year:
AMERICAN’S IDEOLOGY JAN/FRB MAR/APR MAY/JUN
CONSERVATIVE 40 37 34
MODERATE 34 36 36
LIBERAL 22 23 26
That’s a stunning collapse in such a short period of time, while the long-demonized term “liberal” is making a strong comeback. (Many Democrats prefer the safer-sounding “moderate,” as you can see if you follow the link above. Black, young, Latino Americans all prefer “moderate” to “liberal,” when we know they are politically liberal.)
More Gallup:
The decline in self-identified conservatism in 2020 has been seen about evenly among men and women, and among all political party groups.
  However, it was more pronounced among adults in upper-income households as well as among middle-aged adults (aged 35 to 54) than their counterparts.
  The conservative falloff has also been stronger among White and Hispanic Americans than Black Americans. Relatively few Black Americans (25%) identified as conservative in January/February, and thus there may have been less opportunity for the rate to decline.
Among those who earn more than $100,000, the number of self-identified conservatives dropped 11 points, from 40% to 29%. And since we’ve tracked suburban voters so closely for the last several cycles, they are also leaving the conservative fold, from 36% to 28%. In fact, and this is crazy—there are fewer conservatives now in the suburbs than in cities (33%)!
Still, don’t count out rural areas, getting hit harder and harder by COVID-19. They’ve gone from 50% conservative to 43%. That’s why states like Alaska, Iowa, Montana, and Ohio are suddenly back in play at both the presidential and Senate levels.
Republicans exist only insofar as conservatives exist, as they and Trump fight to make their tent even smaller and unwelcome to anyone who isn’t ideologically pure. Seeing at close range the kind of rampant hypocrisy, corruption, mismanagement, and incompetence inherent in conservatism, Americans are ditching the label and, with it, their votes for Republicans.
And they still have a lot further to fall.

0,2020-08-02T12:05:36+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/one-american-now-dies-from-19-every-minute/,One American now dies from COVID-19 every minute,"For those keeping track of the many accomplishments of the Trump administration, we reached a milestone of sorts that received little attention this week: The U.S. daily total of officially recorded deaths due to the SARS-CoV2 virus is now averaging one death per every minute, nearly every day.
The United States recorded 1,456 new deaths on Wednesday, the highest one-day increase since 1,484 on May 27, according to a Reuters tally, bringing total deaths to 151,229.
That was Wednesday. We’re actually closer to 156,000 (official) deaths as of this writing. While tallies vary slightly depending on the specific database, the one death per minute “official death” figure has been roughly consistent over the last three days.
Of course, these are only deaths verified and recorded as caused by the COVID-19 virus. Deaths from pneumonia, heart attacks, stroke or other causes brought on by COVID-19  but occurring before the decedent was actually tested are assumed to drastically increase the death total. It is not possible to determine the total number of excess COVID-19 deaths because the COVID-19 tests actually available to medical providers and hospitals in this country are almost entirely reserved for people still alive. One JAMA Internal Medicine study published in July found that an additional 28% of the total “official” deaths could be so attributed.
For comparison purposes, approximately 1,660 Americans per day die from all forms of cancer, annually, while 1,772 succumb daily from heart disease, including coronary artery disease and stroke. With or without the additional 28% of “excess deaths” as a benchmark, COVID-19 has been a leading cause of daily deaths in this country on and off since Apri, with various reported daily totals regularly exceeding the deaths from heart disease or cancer, particularly during New York City’s initial outbreak.
So while the “one death per minute” figure is not unique since the start of the pandemic, it does provide a reference point for people to wrap their minds around.
Various statistical analyses have been developed that explain how Americans spend their time daily. For example, Americans spend (on average) eight hours and 48 minutes per day sleeping. Assuming you are an “average American,” then while you sleep tonight, approximately 528 Americans will die of the COVID-19 virus.
In the time you spend showering, bathing, brushing your teeth and combing/brushing your hair on any given day, an estimated 47 Americans will die of the virus.
In the time you spend eating breakfast, lunch and dinner each day, 77 Americans will die of COVID-19.
Assuming you are an “average American,” today you will spend two hours and 46 minutes watching television. During your TV time, 166 Americans will have died from the virus.
Americans typically spend two hours and 51 minutes on their smartphones daily, with most of that time spent on social media. So while you looked at your phone today, another 171 Americans died from the virus.
And during the rest of the day, another 451 Americans will have died. This is happening every day.
For a bit of perspective on what 1500 people looks like, here’s a crowd of hundreds of workers in Brussels, protesting layoffs at their Volkswagen factory.
In three months, based on the current death rates, this group of Zapatista marchers in Zocalo Square illustrates how many more people (about 150,000 more) will have died.
But death rates are not staying the same. In July, they increased as the disastrous effects of Trump and the Republican Party’s reopening policies became manifest. As schools reopen, even partially, they will likely spike again, with children as the primary carriers, if not the primary victims. Just two weeks ago Alexis Madrigal, writing for the Atlantic, could state that the deaths of 300,000-800,000 people, based on the infection-fatality rate scenarios projected by the CDC, was still “unlikely.” Now, with a death toll approaching 160,000 in those two weeks, it doesn’t seem unlikely at all.
The lack of containment by American authorities has resulted in not only lost lives, but also lost businesses, savings accounts, school years, dreams, public trust, friendships. The country cannot get back to normal with a highly transmissible, deadly virus spreading in our communities. There will be no way to just “live with it.” There will only be dying from it for the unlucky, and barely surviving it for the rest of us.
Assuming Joe Biden wins the election, he will not be able to exercise any power until nearly the end of January. In the dead of winter, viruses typically thrive as people stay indoors. Does anyone believe that the Trump administration is going to magically change course, implementing a national lockdown and a massive ramped up testing effort out of some sense of duty to the American people? Does anyone expect anything fundamentally different on a national level from this administration between now and January, particularly if and when Donald Trump loses the election in November? We’ve already seen the results of the administration’s policy of dumping all responsibility onto the states.
Right now, it looks as if we’re still hurtling headlong into the darkest winter in this country’s history.

0,2020-08-02T11:54:40+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/here-are-13-ways-a-democratic-wave-pickup-of-double-digit-senate-seats-is-a-real-possibility/,Here are 13 ways a Democratic wave pickup of double-digit Senate seats is a real possibility,"Early in the cycle, the big question was wether Democrats could pick up the net-four seats they needed to get control of the U.S. Senate (assuming they won the presidency, and the tie-breaking vote). It was a tall order, given that only one top pickup opportunity (Colorado) was in a 2016 blue state. But Donald Trump’s disastrous and deadly presidency hasn’t just crushed his own reelection chances, but is now threatening Republican Senate seats no one would’ve ever thought would be at risk, even in some solidly red states.
Welcome to my inaugural ranking of Senate races, by most likely to flip.
TIER ONE (expected to switch)
1. Alabama, Doug Jones (D)
Our two-year Democratic rental, thanks to a narrowly won special election against a child predator, should come to an end this November as Alabama’s strong Republican lean and a run-of-the-mill Republican challenger ends Jones’ term. No regrets. It was great while it lasted.
2. Colorado, Cory Gardner (R)
Joe Biden will win Colorado by double-digits. There’s no way Gardner overcomes that margin, and especially not against former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who remained popular throughout his two terms in office. In fact, Gardner has acted as someone vying for a spot on a second Trump term, reliably defending his president during the impeachment proceedings, rather than a blue-state senator trying to differentiate himself from the top of the ticket.
3. Arizona, Marth McSally (R)
McSally narrowly lost in the Democratic wave in 2018, and since appointed to fill Sen. John McCain’s seat after his death, she is headed toward another defeat at the hands of Democrat Mark Kelly, an astronaut and husband to former congresswoman and gun violence victim Gabby Giffords. Polling is showing both Biden and Kelly pulling away, in a state in which resurgent Latino voters and suburban white women are heavily engaging.
4. North Carolina, Thom Tillis (R) 
Democratic Iraq and Afghanistan war vet Cal Cunningham has proven a surprisingly strong challenger to first-term Republican Thom Tillis, handily leading him in all recent polling. It’s not even looking close, in a state in which Biden has also led (albeit more narrowly). Tillis runs weakly against Republicans, who see him as a traitor to Trump’s cause. And the double-whammy of Trump losing the state, and Tillis losing Trump voters, looks too much to overcome.
5. Maine, Susan Collins (R)
Collins survived decades as a Republican in blue Maine by pretending to be a “moderate” independent-minded legislator. The Trump years have torn that facade away, as she’s sided with the wannabe despot in both his Supreme Court nominations, and in voting to acquit him during the impeachment proceedings. Democrat Sara Gideon, Speaker of the Maine House, is leading in all recent polling, and would be the first woman of color (Indian American) elected in Maine.
These five races would net Democrats the +3 seats they need for a 50-50 Senate, with Biden’s vice-president casting the tie-breaking vote. But what a nightmare that would be, right? We’d have the nominal majority, but well-short of the 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, and without the Democratic votes needs to eliminate that stupid filibuster. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has already declared he’d vote against any such efforts. So it is imperative that Democrats pad their majority in order to have the votes to get rid of the filibuster and push through critical legislation like statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico (if its residents vote for it), voting right protections, economic stimulus, police reforms, measures to address climate change, and other Democratic priorities.
TIER TWO (toss-ups)
6. Montana, Steve Daines (R)
How can Democrats be competitive in a state which Trump won by over 20 points? First, convince popular Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock to run, then watch Trump’s numbers collapse to the point that Biden is actually competitive. Recent polling in this hard-to-poll state show Republicans with the narrow edge, but it’s narrow.
7. Iowa, Joni Ernst (R)
This wasn’t a state that was supposed to be competitive, with Trump winning by nine points in 2016. Yet Trump disastrous trade wars decimated Iowa farmers, and the coronavirus pandemic has only added to anti-GOP sentiment. So this state of rural non-college whites—the core base of the modern Republican Party—is suddenly flirting with voting Democratic. Most recent polling shows Trump leading by a hair, the same as Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield.
8. Georgia, Kelly Loeffler (R)
Georgia has a racist Jim Crow-era election system, in which candidates require 50% in the first round, otherwise the race moves to a January runoff. This is a special election, thus features a “jungle primary” in which all candidates, of all parties, run on the same ballot. If none reaches 50% (and none will), this gets decided January next year. Democrats are running several candidates, and would be best served if they rallied around Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta (where Dr. Rev, Martin Luther King preached).
While Democrats have traditionally suffered turnout woes during the runoff elections, I doubt that’ll be an issue this cycle. January will be HOT in Georgia.
9. Georgia, David Perdue (R)
Same as above, except that there’s no jungle primary. Democrats nominated Jon Ossoff to take on the incumbent. Polling has been mixed in this race, with some showing a tied race, and others showing Perdue close to 50%. But at the same time, almost all polling is showing a competitive presidential contest. If Biden can extend his lead in this coronavirus-stricken state, he could very well pull Democrats across the line with him, at least into January runoffs where defeated and demoralized Republicans might just sit things out.
TIER THREE (lean Republican)
These solidly Republican states shouldn’t be competitive at the Senate level, yet amazingly, they are!
10. Kansas, Open (R)
The conventional wisdom is that if Republican nominate crazed right-winger Kris Kobach, that this seat in this +20 2016 Trump state becomes far more competitive in November. That would make sense, since Kobach cost Republicans the governorship in 2018. Our own Civiqs polling, actually, found Democrat Barbara Bollier competitive no matter who Republicans nominate. A tough state, for sure but Kansas is one of the few remaining Republican states with high educational attainment (the other being Utah). Given the nation’s partisan stratification based on college education, we can expect Biden to narrow the gap from 2016, improving Bollier’s chances down the ballot. And if Republicans nominate Kobach? That can’t hurt, either.
11. Alaska, Dan Sullivan (R)
Alaska is competitive at the presidential level (more here), despite the fact that Trump won it by 15 in 2016. No polling has shown the Senate race competitive, but that’s because 1) there is no Democratic nominee—an independent is filling that slot, and 2) that nominee, Al Gross, has a name ID of about zero percent. Gross is now up in the air, and that should boost that name ID in this cheap state. Also, Democrats will now learn that he is their guy, and will answer accordingly the next time they’re polled.
Without strength at the presidential level, this seat isn’t in play, but Alaska has been trending Democratic for several cycles now, and this year may be the year when that vast swath of land is painted in glorious blue.
12. South Carolina, Lindsey Graham (R)
Pinch me I must be dreaming. Infamous Trump bootlicker Lindsey is vulnerable? Yes. Yes he is. The polling has shown the state tightening at the presidential level, and the pandemic is hitting South Carolina hard, further weakening the state’s dominant Republican Party. Democrats have an awesome candidate in Jaime Harrison. His problem has been that while he’s running even with Graham, most undecideds in the race are conservative voters. It’s a tough hill to overcome. But this is happening:
Every point Trump falls is a point that could cost him in the presidential election, and every point that presidential race narrows is one point less Harrison needs to overcome to win the Senate seat. The play here isn’t for Biden to win, he doesn’t need South Carolina (as nice as it would be!). We need it close enough to give ourselves a chance down ballot.
This is a long-shot, by all means, but it’s a real shot. And Harrison has raised record amounts of cash and has the resources to wage a real campaign in this final three-month sprint to Election Day.
13. Texas, John Cornyn (R)
The big question in Texas is whether it is competitive at the presidential level or not. It’s clear where the state is trending, and no doubt in a cycle or two it will be legitimately purple. But polling is mixed on whether this is the year. And that will inform whether the Senate race is flippable. On its merits, Cornyn should be cruising to reelection. He has none of the baggage Sen. Ted Cruz had in 2018, where he held on to his seat by just 2% of the vote. But if Texas Democrats can get the state’s chronically underperforming Latino vote to activate, then all bets are off—at both the presidential and senate levels.
CONCLUSION
Of the 13 Senate seats currently in play, 12 of them are held by Republicans. The odds of Democrats picking up 10 or 11 seats are currently low, but the trends just keep getting worse and worse for the GOP. The toll of the pandemic isn’t just worsening nationwide, it’s currently disproportionately affecting some of the very states discussed above, like Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, South Carolina, and Texas.
Meanwhile, Trump is doing nothing to reverse his precipitous collapse in his national standing, while also refusing to allow Republicans to distance themselves from him.
So can we get to a double-digit pickup in the Senate? Not today, we wouldn’t, but Republicans still have three months to fall.

Now he has COVID-19,"Days after being forced to share air with a Texas congressman (and staunch anti-mask enthusiast)—who tested positive for COVID-19 the very next day—Democratic congressman Raúl Grijalva announced Saturday that he, too, has tested positive for the deadly virus. 
WASHINGTON— Today, Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva issued the following statement after testing positive for COVID-19:
  “The Attending Physician of the Capitol informed me that I tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, I will be self-isolating in quarantine at his recommendation. I currently have no symptoms, feel fine, and hope to make a quick and speedy recovery.
  “While I cannot blame anyone directly for this, this week has shown that there are some Members of Congress who fail to take this crisis seriously. Numerous Republican members routinely strut around the Capitol without a mask to selfishly make a political statement at the expense of their colleagues, staff, and their families. I’m pleased that Speaker Pelosi has mandated the use of masks at the Capitol to keep members and staff safe from those looking to score quick political points. Stopping the spread of a deadly virus should not be a partisan issue.
  “I urge all of us to recognize the severity of this virus and follow the CDC guidance to keep our family, friends, and loved ones safe. We can all play a part in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.”
Unlike those working for Rep. Louie Gohmert, the aforementioned Texas congressman, the majority of Rep. Grijalva’s staff has been working remotely for months; thus, also unlike with Rep. Gohmert, no “in-person” reveal party of his COVID-19 test results was required. However, as The Washington Post’s Radley Balko points out, the hearing that brought the congressman (and others) together also wasn’t required.
“This is infuriating,” Balko tweeted in a thread on Saturday. “Grijalva chairs the committee investigating the clearing of Lafayette Square. He wanted his hearing to be via video. The Trump administration said it wouldn’t cooperate unless Grijalva flew from Arizona to D.C. to appear in person.”
“Given his comorbidities,” Balko continued, “Grijalva and his staff told me they saw this as a childish taunt—a dare. He agreed anyway, because he thought investigating what happened is important.”

0,2020-08-02T11:42:33+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trumps-vaccine-chief-picks-his-own-former-employer-for-2-1-billion-deal/,Trump’s vaccine chief picks his own former employer for $2.1 billion deal,"The White House on Friday awarded a record-breaking $2.1 billion contract for development of a Covid-19 vaccine, raising questions about a former pharmaceutical executive’s involvement in the administration’s decision.
The deal is for 100 million doses of a vaccine manufactured by Sanofi, a French drug maker, and its British partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
As Fortune reported:
The deal follows billions of dollars of U.S. commitments to other experimental vaccines—all still needing to show their effectiveness in testing—and may stoke concerns that other countries will be left behind. Vaccines are seen as the key to leading the world out of the pandemic that has killed about 675,000 people in a matter of months.
Dr. Moncef Slaoui, a former GSK executive, is head of the White House’s Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s program to develop and disburse an effective coronavirus vaccine. Slaoui’s connection to his former company has been the focus of concern from advocacy groups and politicians skeptical of his claims of neutrality.
According to the New York Times:
Dr. Slaoui is not a federal employee, instead working under a $1 contract that exempts him from federal rules that would require him to list his outside positions, stock holdings and other potential conflicts. Dr. Slaoui said in an interview in May that he was determined to avoid any conflicts of interest, but that his GSK stock represented his retirement from 29 years at the company, and that he had told federal officials he would not take the job if he had to sell it.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) raised concerns over Slaoui’s ties to GSK in May.
“It is a huge conflict of interest for the White House’s new vaccine czar to own $10 million of stock in a company receiving government funding to develop a Covid-19 vaccine,” Warren tweeted. “Dr. Slaoui should divest immediately.”
As Common Dreams reported, the former executive’s refusal to relinquish his shares in the company made the process of awarding a contract a “sham,” in the words of former Office of Government Ethics director Walter Shaub.
“You can’t have a contractor supervising government officials,” said Shaub.

0,2020-08-02T11:36:39+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/kindergarten-level-logic-trump-repeats-false-claim-that-rise-in-19-cases-is-result-of-more-testing-as-cases-surge-across-us/,‘Kindergarten-level logic’: Trump repeats false claim that rise in COVID-19 cases is result of more testing as cases surge across US,"President Donald Trump on Saturday took to Twitter after a game of golf to proclaim the ongoing rise in Covid-19 cases around the U.S. is due to increased testing around the country and not, as health experts have repeatedly explained, because the disease is continuing to spiral out of control around the nation.
“This continued Kindergarten-level logic is why we lead the world in Covid cases and deaths,” tweeted Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) in response to Trump’s latest salvo blaming testing for the increase in cases.
Trump, tweeting after being photographed on the golf course at his club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, took particular aim at his own expert, National Institutes for Health (NIH) director Dr. Anthony Fauci, who told lawmakers Friday that they should expect the pandemic to continue to surge in the U.S. and partially blamed the country’s keeping the economy 50% open as a major factor in the spread.
“If you look at what happened in Europe, when they shut down or locked down or went to shelter in place—however you want to describe it—they really did it to the tune of about 95% plus of the country did that,” said Fauci.
The doctor added that “when you actually look at what we did, even though we shut down, even though it created a great deal of difficulty, we really functionally shut down only about 50% in the sense of the totality of the country.”
The president fired back at Fauci Saturday, calling the public health expert—who has been the director of NIH since 1984—”wrong.”
“We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000,” said Trump. “If we tested less, there would be less cases.”
“Per capita, we’re not even in the top 15 countries for testing,” noted journalist Brian Karem. “Lithuania has tested more of its citizens per capita than us.”
As the New York Times reported, cases continue to rise around the country:
The virus is again picking up dangerous speed in much of the Midwest—and in states from Mississippi to Florida to California that thought they had already seen the worst of it.
As the United States rides what amounts to a second wave of cases, with daily new infections leveling off at an alarming higher mark, there is a deepening national sense that the progress made in fighting the pandemic is coming undone and no patch of America is safe.
The president’s response to the pandemic has been widely criticized for its prioritization of reopening the economy at seemingly nearly any cost and for having an inconsistent approach to testing, masks, and treatment—including, as Common Dreams reported, promoting the views of a Houston-area doctor with interesting views on the role of alien DNA in the manufacturing of medications.
“Bottom line: Trump doesn’t care if your children die if he thinks it helps him win in 2020,” tweeted radio host Dean Obeidallah.

0,2020-08-02T10:32:58+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/defeating-donald-trump-might-be-the-easy-part-uprooting-the-toxic-movement-he-represents-could-take-decades/,Defeating Donald Trump might be the easy part. Uprooting the toxic movement he represents could take decades,"Despite the deep hole he’s in, Donald Trump could still win re-election, as we are constantly reminded. If he loses, some observers warn, there could be considerable trouble, even violent resistance. But perhaps the biggest problem facing us in the medium-to-long term is what happens if Trump loses. In particular, what do we do to undo Trumpism? Not just to counter the destruction Trump has wrought, but the decades-long preconditions that made his election possible, if not almost inevitable.
This question was raised recently by Foreign Policy in Focus editor John Feffer, whose 2017 book, “Aftershock: A Journey Into Eastern Europe’s Broken Dreams” I reviewed here.  That book was deeply steeped in the difficult challenges of rebuilding democratic culture and, unsurprisingly, Feffer’s recent column cited several historical signposts to illuminate the challenge we face — the end of the Confederacy, Nazi Germany and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. All those efforts to rebuild were “flawed in various ways” he wrote — the first and last most dramatically. But learning from them “might help us avoid repeating the mistakes of history.”
The thrust of Feffer’s argument is twofold: First, that Trump is backed by an amalgam of forces, including “the bulk of conservative civil society,” and even if he’s defeated, Trumpism — the particular articulation he’s given to those forces — will survive the election and continue to be an existential threat. It “could succeed in finishing what Trump started — disuniting the country and destroying the democratic experiment — unless, that is, the United States were to undergo a thorough de-Trumpification.” In fact, he notes that “a post-election insurrection is not out of the question.”
Trump himself may be expendable, from the far right’s point of view, but Feffer writes that “Trumpism — which lies at the intersections of racial and sexual anxiety, hatred of government and the expert class, and opposition to cosmopolitan internationalism — is not so easily rooted out.” In part, that’s because it’s “a political chimera with the head of an establishment machine and the body of a radical social movement.”
Second, Feffer argues that we must learn from the examples of the past, flawed though they might be in many ways, in order to do better. While I agree with Feffer’s core argument, both his choice of past examples and the lessons drawn from them are less satisfying. That’s not a reason to abandon his approach, but to pursue it more robustly.
Two of the examples — Nazi Germany and Saddam’s Iraq — are classic examples of “pathocracies,” which I’ve written about before, and thus led me to reach out to two experts I’ve consulted in the past: Ian Hughes, the author of “Disordered Minds: How Dangerous Personalities Are Destroying Democracy,” and therapist Elizabeth Mika, who wrote perhaps the most politically crucial chapter of “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump” (Salon review here).
“Pathocracy is the situation where dangerously disordered personalities predominate in positions of power.” Hughes said. “Such individuals’ propensity for violence and greed, their incapacity for basic human empathy and their disordered perception and cognition, which renders them unable to ameliorate their distorted worldviews with reality and reason, mark them out as a danger to others.”
We may not be a full-blown pathocracy yet, Hughes and Mika agree, but we’re headed in that direction.
“We are at the beginning of this process,” Mika said. “Like the virus-induced disease, it may need to take its course before it weakens and we can start to rebuild from the devastation it will cause. It’s hard to say what shape this devastation may ultimately take.”
Hughes referred to “The Dictatorship Syndrome,” by Alaa Al Aswany, which describes how a fully entrenched pathocracy operates like a machine, without any need for the dictator’s instructions.
“The U.S. is clearly not in that situation. It does however have many features of a society on its way towards pathocracy,” Hughes said, from the “clearly disordered president who enjoys widespread popular support” to the legion of lackeys eager for power and the erosion of democratic institutions they carry out for him, to the state-sponsored spread of “misinformation, hate mongering, and attacks on democratic opponents” and the resulting chaos of antisocial behavior.
The “partial collapse of democracy” in the United States, Hughes said, “can be used as one guide to the necessary response to Trumpism once Trump has been defeated,” Hughes said. “So too can comparisons with previous undemocratic regimes, such as those used by Feffer.”
But democratic recovery is extremely difficult, Hughes warns. He mentioned the example of Jared Diamond’s book “Upheaval: How Nations Cope with Crisis and Change,” which explores how countries have successfully navigated similar major upheavals in the past. “The lesson I drew from his book, however, and from history more broadly, is that nations seldom learn from their descent into pathocracy,” Hughes said  So he argued that a more limited, targeted approach is better than one that tries to change everything at once.
Mika is skeptical as well, but from a different direction. “The way I see it, de-Trumpification as such is not possible yet, as we have not fully Trumpified yet,” she said.
What I mean by that is not only that Trumpian fascism has not fully taken over our society — which I hope against hope does not happen — but that we don’t fully understand what is happening and why. And understanding is key. Its lack has brought us Trumpism in the first place.
I see Trumpism as an inevitable and necessary confrontation with our shadow. This confrontation is meant to break apart our (deadly) illusions, most of all that about our non-ending progress, exceptional greatness, and immunity to pain and suffering that envelop such large swaths of the world.
We have cultivated these illusions at the expense of our growth and health, as our shadow side remained repressed and invisible, especially to those in power who have been most involved in the production of our toxic myths. Of course working Americans and minorities know the shadow all too well, as it is their daily bread.
This parallels an argument Hughes made in May, describing America as “a place where bad ideas never die.” As the depths of America’s failure to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic became clear, he contrasted the fate of the two Cold War superpowers:
The fall of the Soviet Union is remembered by many as the end of a bad idea — the idea that a one-party state can violently suppress its citizens in the name of the collective good. The “Fall of America” moment [caused by the pandemic] is of a different nature. It can be understood, not as the end of a bad idea, but rather as the pyrrhic victory of a whole set of bad ideas long present in U.S. culture which have grown to define the country in the last few decades.
The ideas Hughes cited were that “inequality is good,” that “religious freedom [so-called] trumps public good,” that “in the Civil War, the wrong side won,” the myth of “American exceptionalism,” i.e., “the idea that the U.S. is a unique, morally-superior civilization destined to guide the world” and “the myth of redemptive violence,” meaning “the belief that good can triumph over evil only by means of conflict.” These can all be seen as different forms of narcissistic fantasy and, more specifically, collective narcissistic fantasy. The more we cling to such fantasies, the more our shadow grows.
One of those bad ideas ties directly to one of Feffer’s three examples, that of “Reconstruction after the American Civil War,” and the failure of that process created the historical foundation on which Trumpism is built.
The lesson Feffer draws is a tough one: “Today’s Republicans, the equivalent of the northern Democrats of the post-Civil War era and a true confederacy of dunces, cannot be allowed to persist in their current incarnation as a vehicle for Trumpism.” To avoid that, “the next administration would have to drain the swamp Trump created, bring criminal charges against the former president and his key followers, and launch a serious campaign to change the hearts and minds of Americans who have been drawn to this president’s agenda.”
To accomplish that, he concludes, “it’s imperative to separate the legitimate grievances of Trump supporters from the illegitimate ones,” and both must be addressed in different ways.
This is the strongest aspect of Feffer’s argument — which is not to say it will be easy to pull off. Bringing charges against Trump may well be justified on multiple grounds, but doing so itself threatens democratic norms: The winners don’t throw the losers in jail, not in fully-functioning healthy democracies. But “no one is above the law” is also a central norm — a norm previously violated when Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, and that came back to bite us in a big way with the rise of Trump. Clearly, this needs to be carefully thought through, and a professional, non-political investigation into Trump’s actual or potential crimes will be required.
Feffer also ties this point to the example of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg trials, where “the Allied victors put nearly 200 Nazis on trial for various crimes: 161 were convicted and 37 sentenced to death.” To follow this example, Feffer suggests that federal prosecutors should prosecute Trump and his top associates as a criminal enterprise under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Doing so could “not only remove him from the political equation but could effectively delegitimize Trumpism and prevent a second round of it from occurring.”
Yet Feffer also notes that the Nuremberg Trials did not actually delegitimize Nazism. A 1947 survey in the U.S.-occupied sector of Germany found that 55% believed that “National Socialism was a good idea badly carried out,” which included Germans under 30 as well.
But there’s more to that story, Hughes argued. In contrast to the lesson from Diamond’s book that nations seldom learn, “Germany stands out as the truly remarkable exception to this rule,” even though “Nazi officials remained in positions of authority for decades after the war.”
The idea that Nazi crimes were the work of a handful of evil leaders was widespread for decades, Hughes wrote in his review, and only ended “thanks largely to one man, the German Jewish lawyer and Social Democrat Fritz Bauer,” who prosecuted low-level participants in Nazi atrocities, “low-level Germans who had been active at Auschwitz, low-level Nazi police, low-level German judges who had sentenced German resistance leaders and Jews, doctors who had participated in Nazi euthanasia, and rank-and-file German soldiers who had participated in atrocities.”
Without Bauer’s tireless efforts, Germany would probably never have faced up its past. As it was, that took decades to accomplish.
“The lesson for the U.S., therefore, is that few countries have attempted to, and none have succeeded in, the immediate de-pathologizing of society following a period of tyranny,” Hughes told me. “Misguided attempts to do so, as in the attempted de-Baathification of Iraq, were an unmitigated disaster. An aggressive attempt at de-Trumpification, or trying to ‘drive a stake through the heart of Trumpism,’ is therefore not a course, in my view, to be pursued in the aftermath of Trump’s defeat,” no matter how desirable that might seem.
That doesn’t mean doing nothing, but rather focusing intensely on more achievable goals. “Vigorous action is required,” Hughes told me. “We need to make the distinction between the minority actively driving an authoritarian agenda, and supporters who are drawn to aspects of their agenda but who will not violently resist democratic decisions,” Hughes said. “The vast majority of Trump supporters are not violent and will accept Trump’s defeat, even as they organize and campaign for the election of someone who will pursue similar policies and similar means in 2024.”
Of course, Trump is visibly trying to change the equation — and if he wins a second term, he might well succeed. But that’s not where we are today, fortunately. Like Hughes, Feffer views the de-Baathification of Iraq as a terrible failure, but draws hope from the fact that Baathism had been in place for generations, while Trumpism is just being established.
This suggests a twofold strategy, Hughes argued:
The response to Trumpism, and defense against it, should therefore focus on stringent measures to contain the power of the GOP and its ultra-wealthy backers (as the most powerful anti-democratic forces in the U.S.), alongside initiatives to reduce the polarization in U.S. society and reinvigorate all American citizens’ beliefs in democracy as the way to organize society.
Democrats already have some idea of how to pursue the first half of this strategy — though their commitment is still quite uneven. HR 1, the top 2019 House legislative priority, includes a suite of measures to reduce the influence of big money on both parties, including creation of a small-donor-focused public financing system for congressional candidates. (Small donations would be matched at a ratio of six to one, a powerful amplification of grassroots support.) A broader array of elite-power-limiting ideas pushed by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and other 2020 presidential candidates have gained varying degrees of support, but have not gelled into a unified, broadly-supported plan. Hughes’ analysis provides one more reason why Democrats ought to give this their highest priority.
But the second part of his strategy, to reduce polarization and strengthen faith in democracy, needs much more attention than it’s gotten so far. It’s particularly difficult because elite opinion and accepted definitions of “consensus” positions vs. “polarizing” positions don’t necessarily reflect actual public opinion — especially when the public is exposed to new information and freed from the constraints of elite partisan cues, as the recent dramatic swell of support for Black Lives Matter has illustrated.
A poll recently reported in Vanity Fair found that even substantial numbers of hardcore Trump supporters polled in June felt that protesters were “completely right” or “somewhat right” — rising to a stunning 59% majority among softer “Lean Trump” voters, and 72% of undecided voters with “mixed feelings” about the candidates. Even more stunning, the poll was conducted in two waves, and from June 1 to June 11, support jumped “a head-spinning 25 points among Lean Trump voters.”
This cuts deeply against the core dynamic that brought Trump to power in the first place, and points to a potential historical opening, and perhaps an attitudinal shift that could lead to lasting transformation, along the lines of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In early July, district attorneys in Boston, Philadelphia and San Francisco, in partnership with the Grassroots Law Project, announced plans to create just such a process.
“When marginalized people have needed to finally rely on this system for justice, it has routinely failed them in the worst ways imaginable. This isn’t a bug in the system, but a feature,” the DAs said in a statement, describing what they intended to transform.
But the “goals of peace and reconciliation efforts are better defined, I think, where the culprit is relatively clear, i.e. ‘just’ racism,” Mika said. And this initiative is even more narrowly focused on the justice system. Whether it can facilitate broader change, even if it’s successful, is an open question”
Trumpism is an amalgam of grievances that, although fortified by racism, go far beyond it. It is not as much a problem to solve or a rift to heal as a fundamental clash of values. There is no reconciliation to be had, I am afraid, between the psychopathic lack of conscience and our recognition, respect for, and desire to live according to higher values. Choosing higher values, however, is the right path, as we acknowledge and grapple with our psychopathic shadow.
That’s a tall order indeed, but Hughes sees the beginnings of a solution. “Citizens’ assemblies, such as have been put in place in countries such as the UK, France and Ireland, are one possible means of re-establishing practices of democracy which can heal divisions and undermine the appeal of dangerous demagogic leaders,” he said. In his native Ireland, that process played a crucial role in repealing the constitutional prohibition on abortion, as well as advancing a set of climate-change recommendations, all passed by majorities of at least 80%, which helped inspire a wave of climate-change citizens’ assemblies across Europe and elsewhere over the past year.
“Pathocracies thrive on chaos and division,” Hughes explained. “In an environment of violence and hatred, those whose pathological characteristics match that culture will ascend to power. To destroy a pathocracy, tensions must be reduced, hatreds ameliorated, and reason and care must again become the foundations of society.”
In the aftermath of Trumpism, he said, “the focus must be on defending against those who seek to create and profit from such destructive environments and instead to create the institutions and norms that will allow the psychologically healthy majority of the population to create the rules.” That’s why he argues that “an aggressive campaign of de-Trumpification would be counterproductive. The best response is instead to strengthen the norms and institutions that [Trump] himself despises.”
This is only a broad overview of what will be needed.  I haven’t even mentioned the courts. Feffer notes that the 200-odd federal judges appointed by Trump “will do their best to block all attempts to deconstruct Trumpism.” His suggested solution, “to make it illegal for judges to be members of the Federalist Society,” is comically inadequate to the depth of the problem. But what matters now is that we begin thinking in such big-picture terms.
Toward the end of his column, Feffer issued a warning:
To avoid a second Civil War, however, a second American Revolution would need to address the root causes of Trumpism, especially political corruption, deep-seated racism, and extreme economic inequality.
Otherwise, even if The Donald loses this election, the political creature he represents will rise from the ashes and eventually return to power.
This is the scale on which we need to be thinking — not exclusively or obsessively, and certainly not enough to distract from the immediate task of defeating Trump in November. But it’s necessary to look down the road, because we need to lay the groundwork for the even more difficult struggles ahead.

It’s enough to have Mitch McConnell sweating about his status as a future minority leader, if not future former senator. With that in mind, CNN reports that McConnell has given Republican Senate candidates permission to distance themselves from Trump, particularly on his mass-murder approach to the coronavirus and Trump’s continued claims that it’s safe for children to return to school.
The problem for Republicans looking to separate themselves from Trump is … they can’t. By now, every single candidate up for election in House or Senate who carries a GOP label has signed on to Trump’s most outrageous claims repeatedly. McConnell may have authorized them to show “flexibility” and “independence,” but neither of those qualities have on display in the least over the last three years. Instead, even Republicans who went into the Trump era after disparaging Trump the candidate have been utterly subservient to his every random whim. They’ve backed Trump on  his destruction of vital alliances, backed Trump in his racism and xenophobia, backed Trump on an endless array of unsupported conspiracy theories. And in January, they underscored their support for Trump by signing the ultimate loyalty pledge when Republicans in both House and Senate refused to remove Trump from office despite overwhelming evidence of his guilt.
Susan Collins is concerned. She has damn good reason to be, because Sara Gideon is smashing Collins in fundraising and running ahead of her in the polls. It’s gotten bad enough that Collins is running ads in which her only attack on Gideon is that the Democratic candidate wants to do too many good things. Gideon should just run the same ad.
In past cycles, Collins has been the epitome of exactly what McConnell is talking about now—a Republican who votes with Republican leadership on every important issue, then discovers her “independence” in election season. But Collins, like every other Republican, finds that her suit of independent camo has been repainted in screaming orange after she supported a long line of unsuitable Trump nominees—topped off with Brett Kavanaugh—and then found that a little thing like strong-arming a foreign government to provide false evidence in a U. S. election wasn’t enough to warrant a vote against Trump.
And Collins is the best of them. Let that sink in. Mitch McConnell is telling a group of people who have been more consistent and more vocal Trump supporters than Susan Collins, that they should now go forth and pretend that there’s a dime’s worth of daylight between them and the man currently trying to win the White House by undercutting election integrity and hoping that people in Democratic states will die.
That’s not the only reason it’s about three and a half years too late for Republicans to begin demonstrating this independence. Having bowed down to Trump and refused to call him out over any statement, no matter how ridiculous, racist, or facistic, Republicans are absolutely wedded to those policies. There is no Republican Party except the Donald Trump Party. There’s not a single Republican voter who will reward them for being flexible. Absolute loyalty is their only real play, even if that means hanging onto the tail of the Trumptanic as it heads for the ocean floor.
Because there is definitely one person who will make sure that if they do try to claim any independence from Trump, they stand no chance at all—that’s Donald Trump. Shooting “independent” Republicans in the back has been Trump’s favorite sport. McConnell may have given them permission to edge away from Trump, Trump hasn’t. The moment any Republican says a thing that seems counter to Trump’s most muddle-headed utterance … Trump smash.
No matter what Mitch McConnell says, Republicans signed onto Team Trump in 2016 and utterly sealed their fate in January.  They might as well just site back and enjoy the ride, because they long ago sold their souls.

  AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, Democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report. I’m Amy Goodman.
The U.S. coronavirus death toll has topped 150,000 on Wednesday, the highest of any nation by far. The hardest hit states per capita are Florida, Louisiana, Arizona, Mississippi, Alabama, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Idaho, Tennessee and Georgia, a list that includes all seven of the original Confederate states.
Today we talk about COVID and so much more as we spend the hour with Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author, Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught for more than 50 years, now laureate professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona. Author of more than 100 books. Professor Chomsky spoke with Democracy Now!’s Nermeen Shaikh and I on Thursday, from his home in Tucson, Arizona about the coronavirus crisis.
NOAM CHOMSKY We should understand the roots of this pandemic. If we do not understand the roots and extirpate them, there is going to be another and worse one coming. So far we have been kind of lucky. The coronavirus, pandemics, epidemics are very serious, and there are many possibilities. So far, all the ones that have happened in the last ten or 15 years, either the virus has been very deadly but not very contagious, like Ebola, or very contagious but not very deadly, like COVID-19. What happens when the next one comes along that is both very contagious and very deadly? We are in deep trouble. Deep. Much worse than this. Much worse than the so-called “Spanish flu,” which ought to be called the Kansas flu by Trump’s logic. It originated in Kansas the century ago. We may be facing something much worse than that.
There are ways of dealing with it. After the SARS epidemic in 2003, scientists knew that another one is very likely. They warned against it. They presented policies that could be carried out. They weren’t implemented, in part because of deep institutional pathologies. The drug companies who are the obvious candidates for dealing with it can’t, by straight capitalist logic. You don’t spend money to try to prevent a catastrophe ten years from now. What you do is try to make money tomorrow. That is the logic of the system. So the pharmaceutical companies were ruled out by capitalist logic.
The government could step in. The government, in any event, does most of the basic research for vaccines and drugs, almost all of them. So they could have stepped in, create laboratories, and plenty of unlimited resources. But they are blocked by the neoliberal plague. Remember Ronald Reagan—that government is the problem, not the solution, which means we have to take decision-making and action out of the hands of government, which has a flaw; it’s somewhat responsive to the population. We have to shift it to unaccountable, private tyrannies, which are totally unaccountable to the population. That is the meaning of Reagan’s slogan. That is the fundamental principle of neoliberalism. We’ve been suffering—the world has been suffering from it for 40 years, except for the tiny percentage who have become super rich and extremely powerful. Well, that blocks the government.
Nevertheless, there were things that the government could do. When the Obama administration took office, in the first few days, Obama called the presidential scientific advisory board, which had been established by George H.W. Bush, the first Bush, who had some respect for science. Obama called it. He requested that they put together a pandemic reaction program, a way to deal with a pandemic if it comes. They came up with a report a couple weeks later. It was implemented. It was in place until January 2017.
Trump came into office, the first few days, dismantled the whole system. Nothing. That’s part of the general wrecking ball. “We have to destroy everything that Obama did. We have to wreck everything.” Because it is the only way to look like you are doing something. Happening all over. So that went.
There were programs of U.S. scientists working in China with Chinese colleagues to try to detect and identify coronaviruses. Most of them are deep in caves. It’s very dangerous work. Some have been killed, Chinese scientists. But they were finding them and identifying them and testing them. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is the main center for investigating this. Trump canceled the program.
There were simulations run of a pandemic as late as October 2019 warning of what would happen. No attention. The Trump administration isn’t interested. So when the epidemic finally hit, the United States was singularly unprepared. After that comes a series of grotesque inactions and actions. For a couple of months, Trump refused to admit that it was happening.
Other countries were doing things. In Asia, Oceania, Australia, New Zealand, they were reacting. Some of it, South Korea, which was one of the first places hit, never had to go to a lockdown because they dealt with it rationally. They identified the places that were hot spots, controlled them, tested, traced people for contacts. Countries pretty much functioned. Vietnam has reported zero deaths, and apparently that is taken quite seriously by leading U.S. specialists. The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, which monitors the international situation, records zero deaths from Vietnam, which has a 1,400-mile border with China. South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia are doing quite well. And Europe, they delayed in quite a way, but they did finally act. As you mentioned, the curve has sharply reduced since March for most of Europe. Some of them, like Norway, Germany, doing quite well in this respect. People are traveling through southern Italy almost like normal.
It has gotten so extreme that, as you know, Europe has banned American visitors. The United States is such a pariah state that Americans are not permitted to go to other countries. Other countries won’t allow them in. This is kind of mimicked in a horrible way in Brazil. Bolsonaro just denies that it’s happening. “It’s just a mild flu. Don’t worry about it. Brazilians are strong. We don’t care.” So big meetings of right-wing Bolsonaro supporters dancing in the streets and spreading the virus, and Bolsonaro says fine.
And one of the really world-shaking crimes that is being carried out is the destruction of the Amazon. That affects the whole world, not just Brazil. It’s basically genocide to the indigenous populations. Scientific predictions are that on our current course, the Amazon will shift in about 15 years from being a net sink of carbon dioxide to a net emitter of carbon dioxide, sometimes called the lungs of the Earth. The forest absorbs huge amounts of carbon dioxide. It will start emitting them instead. A little further down the road, the Amazon, under the current course, will just turn into savanna, no forest anymore. Devastating for Brazil and the other Amazonian countries. Devastating for the world. It’s one of the main oxygen producers of the world.
At every level, we are racing madly towards total catastrophe under the leadership of sociopathic fanatics. It is as if some evil demon decided to take over the human species and drive them to self-destruction. Much of the world is trying to counter it, almost all of the world, but the United States and Brazil are the extreme cases of racing with dedication towards disaster.
Going back to this election, that is the reason why it is the most dangerous, the most significant election in history. Why Trump is, in fact—this may sound outrageous, but it’s true—Trump is the most dangerous figure in human history. The Republican Party today is the most dangerous organization in human history. You can compare Trump to, say, Hitler, the Wannsee declaration in 1942, called for killing all the Jews, tens of millions of Slavs, not destroying humanized society. There has been nothing like this. Nothing.
The Republican Party, we know how they shifted. You go back just a decade or so, John McCain, 2008, was running for president. His program had some pretty weak, but some policies directed to global warming. The Republican Congress was beginning to contemplate global warming, policies to restrict global warming. The Koch brothers, a superrich energy corporation, got wind of this. They had been working for years to prevent it. David Koch, one of the Koch brothers who died recently, launched an incredible campaign to make sure that the Republican Party would turn to denialism. They bribed senators, intimidated others with the threat of running counter-campaigns against them. Huge lobbying campaign. Astroturf campaigns. A massive juggernaut. The party shifted, dropped all of its efforts to deal with climate change. It’s now a party led by denialists.
AMY GOODMAN: As you talk about this denialism and the science denialism, first dealing with the climate crisis and then extending to the pandemic, both threatening life on Earth, with President Trump now holding a daily coronavirus press briefing without the scientists, you have Anthony Fauci throwing out the first ball at the Washington Nationals game, the chief infectious disease scientist, who won’t play ball exactly with the White House, so he is not in the coronavirus briefing. You have Dr. Birx. President Trump says she’s right outside, but she is not a part of this news conference. Do you think reporters who are sitting in the White House briefing room should refuse to be there unless scientists are there and unless President Trump wears a mask?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Yes, I think so, and I think they should do much more. They should be pointing out constantly what I just said: we’re dealing with the most dangerous figure in human history, backed by the most dangerous organization in human history, and give the facts. Not only the pandemic, but the much more serious threat of environmental disaster and the growing, very severe threat of nuclear war.
In my opinion, every newspaper should have on the front page an image of the Doomsday Clock. You know all about this, but every January, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists gathers—the main scientific journal dealing with these issues—gathers scientists, political analysts to try to give an estimate of the security, the state of the world security. Started shortly after the atom bomb, it has been going on for 75 years. The minute hand is moved closer or farther—it oscillates—closer or farther to midnight, depending how dangerous the world situation is. Midnight means we are finished.
Every year that Trump has been in office, the minute hand has moved closer to midnight. Two years ago, it reached the closest it had ever been. This last January, the analysts gave up minutes; they moved to seconds. A hundred seconds to midnight. Since January, Trump has made every one of the issues that they have brought up worse. There were three major issues. One is of course the threat of nuclear war, second the threat of environmental catastrophe, the third the deterioration of democracy. Which does belong, because it is only with a vibrant democracy of informed, engaged public that we can have any hope of escaping from the two existential crises.
Since January, Trump has succeeded in making all three crises worse. I mention the nuclear weapons issue, considerably worse thanks to Trump’s actions. The environmental crisis of course getting worse, as he continues to press for maximization of the use of the most dangerous fossil fuels, cuts back through his EPA representatives and others, cuts back on the efforts to mitigate the crisis through regulatory means. And democracy, it’s pretty obvious; the executive branch has been essentially cleansed of independent voices. Nothing but sycophants of Pompeo variety. “We were sent by God to save Israel.”
The Inspectors General who were imposed by Congress, by the Republican Congress to monitor malfeasance of the executive branches, purged. Trump in fact went out of his way to humiliate the senior Republican senator, Charles Grassley, who had spent much of his career imposing these monitors. The attorney for the Southern District of New York looked into the Trump swamp; fired. Congress, turned by McConnell, used to be called the greatest deliberative body in the world. Now it is a joke. Doesn’t do any deliberation. It does essentially nothing except try to race through as many appointments of young, ultra-right judges as possible so they can pack the judiciary for a generation. The only other thing it does is figure out ways to pour money into the—dollars into the pockets of the rich, like the tax scam. That’s the Senate, the greatest deliberative body. Proposals come from the House for legislation; McConnell just cans them. Don’t look at them. That is not the role of the Senate.
Going back, that’s why they should be putting the Doomsday Clock on the front of every newspaper. Show us what the United States is doing to the world. To itself and the world. That should be in front of everyone’s attention. And there are many other things that should be done. There should be major protests now, everywhere, against the use of military force to occupy American cities and to crush peaceful dissidents. This is intolerable in a functioning democracy. We can’t sit by and let it happen, just let it proceed step by step until we reach real catastrophe.
AMY GOODMAN: Professor Noam Chomsky. When we come back from break, he talks about Israel’s threat to annex the West Bank, the upcoming U.S. election and more.

Vindman accuses Trump of ‘bullying and intimidation’ in scathing WaPo op-ed,"On Saturday, writing for The Washington Post, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, one of the key witnesses in the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, slammed the president and stood up for his principles.
“After 21 years, six months and 10 days of active military service, I am now a civilian. I made the difficult decision to retire because a campaign of bullying, intimidation and retaliation by President Trump and his allies forever limited the progression of my military career,” wrote Vindman. “At no point in my career or life have I felt our nation’s values under greater threat and in more peril than at this moment. Our national government during the past few years has been more reminiscent of the authoritarian regime my family fled more than 40 years ago than the country I have devoted my life to serving.”
Since his testimony, Vindman was denied a routine promotion through the military ranks after White House officials dug up dirt on him and passed it along to the Pentagon. Vindman decided to retire from service, with his lawyer citing a culture of retaliation.
“Our citizens are being subjected to the same kinds of attacks tyrants launch against their critics and political opponents,” wrote Vindman. “Those who choose loyalty to American values and allegiance to the Constitution over devotion to a mendacious president and his enablers are punished. The president recklessly downplayed the threat of the pandemic even as it swept through our country. The economic collapse that followed highlighted the growing income disparities in our society. Millions are grieving the loss of loved ones and many more have lost their livelihoods while the president publicly bemoans his approval ratings.”
“Since the struggle for our nation’s independence, America has been a union of purpose: a union born from the belief that although each individual is the pilot of their own destiny, when we come together, we change the world. We are stronger as a woven rope than as unbound threads,” wrote Vindman. “America has thrived because citizens have been willing to contribute their voices and shed their blood to challenge injustice and protect the nation. It is in keeping with that history of service that, at this moment, I feel the burden to advocate for my values and an enormous urgency to act.”
“When I was asked why I had the confidence to tell my father not to worry about my testimony, my response was, ‘Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I have served and defended, that all my brothers have served, and here, right matters,'” concluded Vindman. “To this day, despite everything that has happened, I continue to believe in the American Dream. I believe that in America, right matters. I want to help ensure that right matters for all Americans.”

“Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner earned at least $36.2 million as they served in the White House last year, reporting a boost in income from some companies they own that hold residential and commercial properties, new disclosures released Friday show. President Trump’s daughter and her husband, who both serve as top advisers to him, reported a minimum combined income that was at least $7 million higher than in 2018, when they reported making at least $29 million, according to their personal financial disclosures, which they are required to file annually,” The Washington Post reported Friday.
James Hohmann, a national political correspondent for the newspaper, provided context for the story on Twitter.
“They put this out late on a Friday night because they don’t want people to understand the extent to which they’re profiting from private business holdings, which present tons of conflicts of interest and from which they haven’t fully divested, while working in the White House,” Hohmann posted, add a bag of money emoji.
“Jared and Ivanka continue to collect huge sums from their outside businesses even as they work inside the administration. Their combined income last year ranged from $36.2 million to $157 million, based on the ranges in the disclosures,” he added in a second tweet, this time using a bag of money emoji and a stack of cash emoji.

0,2020-08-01T13:04:44+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/the-nypd-unions-didnt-want-you-to-see-these-complaint-files/,The NYPD unions didn’t want you to see these complaint files,"Cops in an unmarked van allegedly stop a driver and invasively search him in the middle of a Staten Island street.
Officers, guns drawn, ransack a Brooklyn apartment — and even eat residents’ food, according to a complaint.
Police take down a man in a chokehold after a Brooklyn block party — and allegedly take turns punching him.
And there are allegations of foul-mouthed, sometimes vindictive intimidation galore — from threatening to shoot a family’s dog to warning “I will knock your f—–g teeth out in front of your daughter.”
These allegations and scores of others accusing NYPD members of everything from bullying to brutality are visible for the first time thanks to a new law scrapping the statute known as 50-a and opening police disciplinary records to the public.
Many of these claims were ultimately not substantiated by an independent city panel that reviews civilian complaints against individual police officers. But their existence and release provide rare insight into the vast number and variety of allegations against police officers, including those who have been the subject of multiple complaints.
THE CITY obtained hundreds of pages of detailed complaint reports via a Freedom of Information request to the Civilian Complaint Review Board before legal challenges temporarily shut down the flow of long-confidential documents.
On Sunday, ProPublica published a database showing the results of investigations into thousands of complaints against police. The database is the equivalent of a card catalog of complaints and includes the only the barest description of each allegation, such as “physical force.”
The records obtained by THE CITY contain the details of more than 250 complaints against 13 officers.
NYPD vehicles may be emblazoned with the phrase “Courtesy, professionalism and respect,” but the complaint reports show very different perceptions about individual officers encountered.
Six years after the chokehold killing of Eric Garner, for which former Officer Daniel Pantaleo was fired only last year, and amid a protest movement demanding an NYPD overhaul following many more deaths of unarmed Black people across the nation, the complaints convey pain, anger and frustration about officers’ alleged misuse of their life-and-death power.
THE CITY’s examination found themes of alleged misconduct spanning boroughs and precincts, recurring across multiple complaints.
Many of the officers whose records THE CITY sought had also been named as defendants in lawsuits alleging misconduct. In a number of instances, the CCRB decided an allegation is “unsubstantiated,” without enough evidence to prove the allegations or clear the officer, but the city later settled lawsuits alleging the same bad behavior. Typically, these lawsuits are settled without an admission of liability or wrongdoing by the officers involved.
Asked to comment about specific complaint reports obtained by THE CITY, the NYPD’s press office responded with a statement referencing ongoing litigation by police and other public safety unions to restrict the release of this misconduct information:
“The NYPD has for many years worked to increase transparency to gain the trust of the communities we serve. While we remain committed to increased transparency, we are equally committed to due process. While recent legislation repealed NYS Civil Rights Law Section [50-a], a federal judge issued a restraining order prohibiting the release of records of which allegations against our officers were found to be false, unfounded or unsubstantiated. We await the results of pending litigation.”
About 4,000 NYPD officers have at least one substantiated complaint and for those officers, ProPublica published summary information about both substantiated and unsubstantiated complaints.
In the greatest share of cases that both organizations gathered, the allegations were “unsubstantiated.” In others, officers were “exonerated” because the board finds an officer’s actions were permissible under the department’s policies. And in some cases, the weight of evidence shows an act did not take place, leading the complaint to be “unfounded.”
Unions that represent police and other uniformed officers are now in court looking to block the release of past unfounded, exonerated and unsubstantiated allegations. They sued this month after Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged to put a database summarizing tens of thousands of complaints — as well as records and results from internal NYPD disciplinary proceedings — on an official city website.
THE CITY obtained the complaint reports from the CCRB before a state judge and then a federal judge this month imposed a restraining order that blocks many of the reports’ release while the unions press their case.
With the most serious misconduct allegations, the CCRB can prosecute cops in front of an NYPD deputy commissioner in a trial open to the public. Penalties range from admonishment to loss of vacation days to, in rare cases, firing. The police commissioner can reverse a guilty verdict but must provide a written explanation.
The process of investigating misconduct starts with a complaint filed by a citizen, which triggers CCRB investigators to try to track down witnesses, check for internal police records or surveillance video for collaborating details, and interview the cops.
Substantiating a CCRB complaint requires leaps over multiple hurdles. Staff investigators request records from the NYPD, which the department doesn’t always provide. A case is only substantiated once the CCRB itself approves it and that board consists of appointees, some chosen by the police commissioner.
In other instances, complaints never even get to be considered by the board because they are withdrawn or because witnesses decline to cooperate. Still other cases the CCRB labels as “administratively closed,” with no further explanation.
Even though the CCRB did not amass enough evidence to prove some cases, the reports obtained by THE CITY indicate patterns of allegations against individual officers who have been the subject of multiple complaints before the CCRB and in the courts.
Aggressive Stops and Searches
Allegations that police abuse their authority are by far the most common complaint in the records ProPublica amassed on the nearly 4,000 current NYPD officers with at least one substantiated case against them.
Many of those incidents involve stops and searches, where officers have to have some reasonable suspicion of criminal activity before making a stop.
The CCRB found four officers in an unmarked police van had no basis to stop a 44-year-old white man in 2014 on Staten Island for an alleged moving violation while his daughter was in the car with him. Although the officers were ultimately found to be not guilty of misconduct charges, the allegations were similar to those that would surface in other incidents.
Detectives Mathew Reich and Philip Vaccarino, along with then-Sgt. John Ryan and an unidentified officer, exited their vehicle and two of them approached the car, according to the complaint.
When the driver asked for permission to reach into his glove compartment to retrieve his license and registration, Reich ordered him out of the car and dragged him by the shirt to the back of the vehicle and told him to put his hands on his head, the complaint claims.
The driver explained that he wouldn’t be able to comply because he recently had tendon surgery on his hand, a dislocated shoulder and spinal problems, he told CCRB investigators.
“I will knock your f——-g teeth out in front of your daughter,” Reich allegedly responded, according to the driver’s account.
Reich patted down the driver and found pill bottles prescribed to him.
“Why are you so nervous?” Reich told the trembling driver, according to the complaint report. “I know you’re hiding something.”
Reich patted the driver’s genitals from outside his pants before “shoving” his hands between the man’s thighs “as if he was looking for drugs hidden between [redacted]’s butt crack,” according to the complaint.
When the officer found nothing on the driver, he began searching through his car, according to the complaint.
By the time Reich had finished searching “every compartment inside the car,” another unmarked police van with roughly half a dozen officers had arrived.
As Reich was heading toward his own vehicle, the complainant said he asked for the cop’s name and shield number.
“I want something,” he said, raising his voice to make sure the officer could hear him.
“(Reich) turned his head back to look but gave no response and continued walking to his car,” according to the complaint.
The driver was then allowed to leave, with no summonses issued or arrests made.
While the CCRB found that Reich and the other cops involved abused their authority by stopping the vehicle, the board concluded that the evidence was insufficient to determine whether Reich threatened the driver, frisked him or refused to identify himself.
The board recommended that charges be brought against Reich, Ryan and Vaccarino for the stop. The CCRB’s Administrative Prosecution Unit, which handles the agency’s most serious cases, brought the charges before an NYPD judge in a trial at 1 Police Plaza. The judge found the three officers not guilty.
The officers had been the subject of previous complaints. The CCRB complaint reports obtained by THE CITY typically show a higher number of complaints for each officer than in the records obtained by ProPublica, because the complaint reports include allegations in cases that did not culminate in a board decision.
Between 2006 and 2016, Ryan was the target of 32 allegations in 16 complaints carried through to a CCRB decision. The CCRB substantiated one charge, was unable to substantiate 19, exonerated him on 10 and declared two to be unfounded.
Vaccarino was the target of a total of 33 allegations in 14 complaints between 2009 and 2016. The CCRB substantiated three charges, was unable to substantiate 13, exonerated him of six and declared two to be unfounded. For nine charges, the complainant was uncooperative.
Reich declined to comment. A man reached at a number listed for Vaccarino hung up after a reporter asked to speak with Vaccarino about misconduct complaints. The Detectives’ Endowment Association, the union representing detectives, did not respond to a request for comment about Reich or Vaccarino. A man who answered a phone number associated with Ryan, who had been promoted to lieutenant, hung up after a reporter identified herself.
The head of the union representing lieutenants said he was unfamiliar with Ryan’s case. “It’s really difficult to comment without knowing the details,” said Lou Turco, president of the Lieutenants’ Benevolent Association.
Retaliation
A trend that emerges in the CCRB complaints is cops allegedly retaliating against individuals who file or even threaten to file complaints against them.
Take Reich — who also was involved in the Staten Island search.
Between 2005 and last year, Reich was the target of 93 allegations in 29 complaints. The CCRB substantiated seven allegations, was unable to substantiate 56, exonerated him on 12 and declared two to be unfounded.
For 14 allegations against Reich, the complainant was uncooperative and in one case unavailable to investigators. In one additional case CCRB could not identify the victim.
When THE CITY contacted Reich on Thursday and asked about the record of complaints against him, he declined to comment, saying: “I’m sorry. I can’t. I apologize.”
The seven substantiated allegations put Reich in a select group, among the highest numbers of substantiated complaints of any officer in the city, the records provided to ProPublica show.
In one March 2007 report, the person who lodged the complaint described driving in his car in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, when one unmarked van cut him off and a second pulled up behind him.
Reich and several other cops allegedly jumped out with guns drawn. One cop pulled the driver out of his car, slammed him up against the hood and allegedly squeezed his testicles while frisking him, the complaint charges.
The cops searched the car and then let the driver go without an arrest or summons, the complaint states. The driver told the CCRB he believed he was being harassed by cops in the 67th Precinct because he’d filed previous complaints against them.
Reich was accused of pointing his gun, performing an illegal vehicle search and refusing to reveal his badge number. There were three witnesses, but the CCRB was unable to substantiate the allegations and closed the case.
Similar allegations came out of another incident, in the 101st Precinct in Far Rockaway, Queens.
In 2011, a Queens man, Reginald Anderson, filed a complaint with the CCRB and then a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging that he’d been repeatedly stopped by cops in the precinct and harassed after he’d lodged several complaints against them.
In one incident, Anderson alleges in his lawsuit, Lt. Gary Messina pulled his van over on 115th Ave. “solely as an act of retaliation.”
In the related CCRB complaint, Anderson claims that Messina told him he’d been pulled over because police believed there was “scrap metal” in the back of the van. He says Messina then demanded to search the vehicle, but Anderson declined his request.
Anderson alleges that Messina ripped open the van’s rear door anyway and searched the interior. He asserted Messina found nothing and that there was no arrest or summons.
Anderson’s lawsuit detailed this and three other alleged incidents of harassment by 101st Precinct cops. That suit was ultimately dismissed by a judge, but the CCRB substantiated the complaint that Messina had performed an illegal stop and search.
The only resulting punishment as the lieutenant was given “instructions” on proper conduct.
The year after Anderson filed his complaint, Messina was promoted to captain, and in 2017 received another promotion — to deputy inspector.
Between 1987 and 2015, Messina was the target of 80 allegations in 27 separate misconduct complaints carried through to a CCRB decision, records show. The CCRB substantiated six charges, was unable to substantiate 36, exonerated him on 29 and found nine to be unfounded.
Reached by phone on Friday, Messina declined to discuss his CCRB record, referring a reporter to the NYPD’s public affairs unit. The unit was sent a detailed list of questions regarding Messina but did not respond.
Escalation of Incidents
Police are trained to de-escalate tense interactions to avoid unnecessary use of force. Yet numerous complaint reports allege officers overreacted to misunderstandings or slights with physical violence or by pulling their gun.
Members of the public lodged more than 7,600 allegations of excessive or unnecessary use of force against the officers in the ProPublica database.
Detective David Terrell has faced multiple allegations of hot-headed behavior, including four accusations that he used a forbidden chokehold during an arrest. Between 2003 and 2016, Terrell was the target of 85 allegations in 34 complaints. The CCRB substantiated four allegations, was unable to substantiate 21, exonerated him on eight and declared nine to be unfounded. For 36 charges, the complainant was uncooperative and in the case of three allegations was unavailable to investigators. In four cases, the complaint was withdrawn.
In August 2006, a bus driver said she encountered Terrell as she was trying to return her vehicle to base after work. A confrontation unfolded when she tried to drive around his unmarked brown Nissan Altima triple parked in the 77th Precinct in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, her complaint with the CCRB states.
When she blew her horn, the complaint charges, Terrell emerged from the car and yelled: “What the f—k are you blowing the horn for? Can’t you see I’m talking in the goddamned car?”
She managed to pull around him but then he began to follow her and soon pulled her over. According to the complaint, Terrell said cops were going to arrest her because “she had a smart mouth.”
He allegedly told her to retrieve the bus permit from the back of the vehicle. But when she exited it to do so, Terrell pushed her against the bus, pulled her arms behind her back and she fell to the ground, the complaint alleges.
When she fell, she said, she urinated on herself. Terrell then placed his foot on her back as she was face-down on the ground and was “choking (the driver) such that she couldn’t breathe,” the complaint alleges.
The bus driver was arrested. During the ride to the precinct, she says, Terrell sat beside her in the backseat and tapped her forehead several times with his police radio, stating, “Say another f——-g word, you f——-g b—-h.” She filed a complaint with the CCRB, but she later declined to cooperate with investigators and the case was closed.
A heating oil delivery driver crossed paths with Terrell when his truck was blocking traffic on a road in Morrisania, The Bronx, as he pumped fuel into a building.
In a February 2012 complaint, the driver alleges that Terrell came up behind him, shoved him and said: “Who the f—k you think you are blocking the block like this? You think you can just f—-ing stop here and everybody has to wait for you?” The driver asked Terrell to calm down, enraging him further, the complaint states.
“Don’t you tell me to f—-ing calm down,” Terell allegedly shouted, ordering the driver to unhook the pump.
As this was unfolding, passersby were yelling at the cop to leave the driver alone, according to the complaint report. The driver said he finished the job and left, but Terrell followed him, turning on his lights and siren pulling him over.
The complaint alleges Terrell pulled the driver out of the truck and handcuffed him, stating, “Is this what the f—k you want, to go to f——-g jail?” He then took the cuffs off and gave the driver a summons for disorderly conduct “with a smile on his face,” the complaint states.
When the driver asked for Terrell’s name, the cop gave it to him, saying, “Make sure you get the spelling of my name right,” according to the complaint.
The driver filed a complaint, but he later decided not to cooperate with the CCRB’s investigation and the case was closed.
THE CITY called two numbers listed for Terrell and got only busy signals. Paul DiGiacomo, president of the Detectives’ Endowment Association, said that Terrell was targeted for complaints by a specific gang because he was very “active” in making arrests.
“They were making complaints against him to get him transferred,” DiGiacomo said. “He was very educated on what they were doing. He saved a lot of lives.”
The union president argued that “criminals weaponize” the CCRB complaint system. Terrell — who’s been sued 20 times in the last decade — has told the New York Post that he has been targeted for aggressive policing by what he called a cottage industry of law firms that specialize in suing cops. In a recent article, Terrell stated that 18 of the 20 lawsuits against him had been dismissed.
Asked about the detective’s record of civilian complaints, Terrell’s attorney, Eric Sanders, responded: “Who cares if he gets complaints? He’s an active cop. The more you interact with criminals, the more complaints you get.”
Regarding the bus driver’s interaction with Terrell, Sanders said, “He doesn’t have to answer for that to anybody.” As for the allegations by the oil delivery driver, Sanders responded: “Who cares? It doesn’t matter. He’s in good standing and it means nothing. I know you guys want to make a big deal about these things but they mean nothing. If they mean something, the department fires them.”
“Complaints are part of business,” he added.
DiGiacomo did not address questions about the other detectives named in the CCRB complaints, including Reich and Vaccarino.
Another of the newly unveiled complaints alleges that Detective Waliur Rahman, an officer in Brooklyn’s 77th Precinct in 1995, pointed his gun at the head of a driver who was pleading to stop his car from being towed.
“Comp[lainant] feels it was not necessary for P.O to threaten his life,” the report summarizes his statements to investigators. “Compl[ainant] thinks P.O judgement was very bad.”
The account was corroborated by a nearby security guard, who gave a written statement about the incident, records show. The CCRB found the case substantiated, but it made no disciplinary recommendations to the NYPD, records show.
Between 1995 and 2018, Rahman was the subject of 32 allegations in 18 complaints.
The CCRB substantiated the gun-pointing charge, but was unable to substantiate 11 other allegations, exonerated him on 13 and declared three to be unfounded. For two charges, the complainant was uncooperative. Two more charges were withdrawn.
Rahman did not respond to messages requesting comment at three phone numbers associated with him.
Invasive Home Searches
Some complaints examined by THE CITY revolve around allegations of invasive searches.
One cop, Sgt. David Grieco, turns up in multiple complaints of illegal searches, involving allegedly unlawful frisking of individuals, illegal vehicle searches or simply barging into people’s apartments without a warrant.
Between 2007 and last year, Grieco was the target of 69 allegations in 31 complaints. The CCRB substantiated 12 charges, was unable to substantiate 27, exonerated him on 11 and declared four to be unfounded. For 10 charges, the complainant was uncooperative and in four charges unavailable to investigators. One case was closed “due to litigation.”
Grieco, who boasts of being nicknamed Bullethead, has been featured in the Daily News for attracting numerous police misconduct lawsuits.
The Sergeants Benevolent Association did not respond to a request for comment. No one responded to a message left Thursday on a voicemail for a phone number listed for Grieco.
Grieco drew repeated complaints in two Brooklyn precincts where he worked, the 75th in East New York and the 67th in East Flatbush.
As one complaint from 2017 put it, “Bullethead is known for entering homes without warrants.”
In one case, the CCRB said it couldn’t substantiate the allegations of illegal entry. But in a lawsuit involving the same situation and officer, the city ended up paying a settlement.
Vanessa Scott of Brooklyn filed suit naming Grieco and several other cops, alleging that in January and then again in February 2016, they forced their way into her Cypress Hills apartment.
In the second incident, Scott told the CCRB that when the cops showed up, they arrested her and her sons. She said the cops took her house keys while she was being processed at the precinct, and when she returned home, her half-brother told her a group of cops had come to the house and searched it top to bottom for four to five hours.
She says all charges against her and her sons were later dropped.
The CCRB deemed all the “entry of premises” allegations against Grieco and three other cops unsubstantiated. A year later the city — without admitting wrongdoing by the cops involved — settled the suit for $52,500, records show.
A similar incident allegedly occurred shortly after midnight on Jan. 11, 2012. The complainant, a 40-year-old Black man, said cops banged on the door of a home in the 75th Precinct, demanding that they be let inside.
When the owner opened the door, Grieco and several other cops allegedly barged in and started going room to room. When the owner asked to see a warrant, one of the cops said, “We don’t need one.” The complaint alleges another cop threatened to shoot the family dog.
Two young men staying in the home were taken out in handcuffs. Relying on three witnesses, the CCRB substantiated a charge of illegal entry against a patrol officer. It deemed unsubstantiated an additional charge against Grieco for threatening to damage property.
In another incident ultimately deemed unsubstantiated, the CCRB found evidence that Grieco and fellow officers had a warrant — only for a different address from the home they allegedly busted into.
The complaint claims that early on the morning of April 13, 2018, officers with guns drawn bashed their way into a Brooklyn apartment and ransacked the place.
The complaint alleges that the cops wound up “breaking things” and even ate residents’ food.
Two occupants were arrested on unspecified charges that were later dropped by the Brooklyn district attorney’s office, the complaint states. One occupant had prior interactions with Grieco and told the CCRB he believed the raid was meant to harass him.
An NYPD internal affairs investigation later discovered that the warrant was for a different apartment building in a different precinct.
The CCRB substantiated a threat of force charge against Grieco but was unable to substantiate the charges of property damage, refusal to obtain medical treatment and refusal to show a warrant. At the CCRB’s recommendation, Grieco was given “instruction” on proper police procedure.
Violent Arrests
Complaints abound of arrests involving violent force, including chokeholds, which have been prohibited under NYPD policy since the 1990s and made illegal July 15, in the wake of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed.
An unnamed person filed a complaint against Sgt. Henry Daverin and several other officers, alleging they illegally beat up Horrell Bennett during a violent arrest after a block party in East New York on June 28, 2014 — just weeks before Garner’s chokehold killing on Staten Island.
The CCRB deemed the complaint “unsubstantiated,” but the city settled a federal lawsuit brought on behalf of Bennett and another man, Nicholas Jones, both of whom are Black, about the same case for $30,000, according to court records.
According to Bennett, at 9 p.m. Daverin ordered him to move his motorcycle, which Bennett claimed was parked legally.
Bennett told Daverin that he had been drinking at the party and was unable to comply, according to the lawsuit and CCRB complaint. A dispute ensued, and Bennett alleges that Daverin and the other officers put him in a chokehold and repeatedly punched him.
Bennett was charged with resisting arrest, but the case was later dismissed, according to the lawsuit. The city’s Law Department denied all allegations in the suit. Daverin, who has since been promoted to lieutenant, did not respond to multiple phone calls and emails seeking comment. Turco, of the lieutenants’ union, said he did not have enough information to be able to comment about complaints related to Daverin.
Between 2012 and last year, Daverin was the target of 58 allegations in 23 complaints. The CCRB substantiated four charges, was unable to substantiate 26, exonerated him on 14 and declared four to be unfounded. For five charges the complainant was uncooperative and in three charges unavailable to investigators. One case was withdrawn and in another the victim was listed as “unidentified.”
In one substantiated case, Daverin oversaw a home search of a man on parole on May 21, 2016, in Brooklyn. The unidentified man said the officers “destroyed the walls and scattered food and items all over,” according to the CCRB report. They also allegedly “tore down some of the sheet rocks from the walls.”
The substantiated case resulted in punishment known as a “command discipline,” according to CCRB records.
That means a loss of up to 10 vacation days.

It is a monstrous crime for which he has not yet been held accountable.
But the latest report from Vanity Fair implicates both Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner of an unspeakable horror orders of magnitude greater. Instead of implementing a comprehensive and aggressive national testing plan the pandemic team originally recommended, Kushner scuttled it. The president and his son-in-law were instead content to allow tens of thousands of Americans die as long as they were mostly people of color, and hailing from Democratic states and counties. Not only that, they saw it as a political opportunity to both cull the numbers of opposing voters and lay blame on Democratic governors at the same time:
Against that background, the prospect of launching a large-scale national plan was losing favor, said one public health expert in frequent contact with the White House’s official coronavirus task force.
Most troubling of all, perhaps, was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner’s team expressed: that because the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically. “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert.
That logic may have swayed Kushner. “It was very clear that Jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what [plan] was going to come out,” the expert said.
Should we believe this report? Maggie Haberman of the New York Times casually confirmed the gist of it, which only raises further questions about why the Times did not report with more alarm on the details:
If this is true–and there is very little reason to doubt its veracity, despite the White House press secretary’s denials–it would constitute perhaps the greatest crime against humanity of any president in American history. Andrew Jackson’s Trail of Tears was more deliberately vicious and murderous; George W. Bush’s immoral war of choice in Iraq killed more people overall.
But no American president has ever betrayed his oath of office more profoundly than in deliberately allowing the deaths of over 140,000 of his own fellow citizens and counting for partisan political gain.
We even lack the vocabulary to even describe it. “Gross negligence” doesn’t reach the level of the crime. “Murder” is lurid, but frankly not a comprehensive enough word to describe the death of 140,000. “Treason” comes to mind when considering that the President of the United States knowingly allowed 140,000 Americans to die because they were mostly his political opponents–but despite his Russia entanglements, there is no direct evidence he did so on behalf of a foreign power.
But there’s another option: “genocide.” The known racial bias of the deaths overlaps with the political bias–black and brown Americans tend to be Democrats and live in Democratic areas, and are disproportionately falling victim to the virus–which in turn would make “genocide” the most compelling way to describe what Trump and Kushner have done.
Genocide. Yes, it sounds preposterous. It sounds like the hyperbole of the deeply unserious. But what else can you call it? No word is perfect, but the crime must have a name that fits the monumental scope of its evil. It must describe what actually happened. And what happened is that the president and his son-in-law deliberately allowed 140,000 (and counting) Americans to die of a pandemic, because it would mostly kill off their political opponents. Because it would kill off mostly poor people of color. Because they thought they could gain an upper hand by blaming opposing governors. But they thought it would advantage them politically. It’s like a plot out of a bad action movie with a comic book villain, except it’s real life and those villains are still governing and making decisions.
When the founders named “high crimes and misdemeanors” as the basis for impeaching a president, they chose the phrase because it was deliberately vague: it would be impossible to write a law to cover every possible abuse of power by a deranged executive. They expected the Congress to respect its own authority and the health of the country enough to know when a relevant “high crime” or “misdemeanor” had taken place.
The problem now is that this president has already been impeached, there isn’t time or appetite to impeach him again, and the Senate controlled by the president’s party refuses to act out of political cowardice and self-interest. Moreover, the phrase “high crime” doesn’t really do justice to the scope of the evil of which the president is reportedly guilty.
This is a crime against humanity. A crime so profound we may not have a law to cover it. A crime with international implications, one so vast it may require an international court.
But somehow, some way, it must be prosecuted. The majority of Americans, the ones not enthralled by conservative infotainment and the Trump propaganda machine, are suffering from years of collective trauma and looking forward to the November election as a means of escape. One can hardly blame them. Nor would many be to blame for wanting to put this entire era behind us and never look back.
But assuming democracy remains intact and Trump is driven from office, this enormous crime cannot be forgotten. It cannot be ignored. There must be accountability for this genocide, this greatest crime in American history.

0,2020-08-01T12:52:25+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/everything-awful-we-suspected-about-donald-trump-has-come-true/,Everything awful we suspected about Donald Trump has come true,"There were 65,853,514 of us who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and it didn’t take long to prove how right we were. Donald Trump waited less than 24 hours after he was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States before he dispatched his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to the White House briefing room — attired in a tent-like garment reminiscent of David Byrne’s “Big Suit” in the Talking Heads documentary, “Stop Making Sense” — to lie about the size of the crowd at his inauguration. Trump’s inaugural ceremony and parade had “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer told the White House press corps, which was already showing photographs of the sparse crowd on the National Mall and Trump waving to entire blocks of unoccupied bleachers along the inaugural parade route. Spicer’s lie about Trump’s crowd size was so blatant, it was shocking.
This article first appeared in Salon.
And the shocks kept coming.
By the time Trump got around on Thursday to his proposal to postpone the November election, the only proper reaction was to say, We told you so. We saw this coming.
It’s too late for people like Steven G. Calabresi, co-founder of the arch-conservative Federalist Society, who wrote an op-ed in the New York Times on Thursday calling Trump’s proposal “fascistic and … grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate.”
That ship sailed in February, pal. Trump was a fascist last year when he openly solicited help from a foreign nation, Ukraine, in his campaign for re-election. He was a fascist when the House voted to impeach him in December. He was a fascist when the Senate voted against removing him from office at his impeachment trial in February. He was a fascist on June 1 when he ordered armed troops and other federal agents to use force to remove peaceful protesters from around Lafayette Park so he could march across Pennsylvania Avenue for his infamous Bible-waving photo-op in front of St. John’s Church.
Trump was a fascist when he ordered his attorney general, William Barr, to drop the charges against his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for lying about his collusion with the Russian ambassador to lift sanctions against Russia. Hell, Trump was a fascist back in 2017 when he fired FBI Director James Comey for refusing to “go easy” in his investigation of Flynn and the rest of Trump’s campaign for colluding with Russians in the 2016 election. He was a fascist when he commuted the sentence of his longtime pal and political fixer Roger Stone, who had been convicted of obstruction of justice and lying to the Congress.
Trump was a fascist way back in 1989 when he advocated bringing back the death penalty in New York after the young men known as the “Central Park Five” were wrongfully convicted of gang-raping a jogger. He was still a fascist last year when he refused to apologize for his harsh comments about the innocent men. “You have people on both sides of that,” Trump told reporters at the White House in June of 2019, again deploying “both sides” in refusing to back down from yet another fascistic position he had taken. He was a fascist every time he called journalists “the enemy of the people” at his rallies.
See, that’s the thing about Donald Trump. He’s a fascist, and he comes right out and admits it. He did it again on Thursday when he suggested at a White House press conference that the only votes that should count are those tallied on Election Day, thus invalidating mail-in ballots, which can take days to count after elections. “So many years, I’ve been watching elections. And they say the ‘projected winner’ or the ‘winner of the election’ — I don’t want to see that take place in a week after Nov. 3 or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen, years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election.”
There he goes again, telling you who he is. He wants to pick those who are allowed to vote using various laws enabling voter suppression, and then pick which votes are counted. This isn’t the way elections are held in a democracy. It’s the way elections are held in a fascist dictatorship.
Trump is beginning to react in real time to an inexorable shift that has taken hold among the electorate. He can’t budge his waning in the polls no matter what he does. Fox News has lost its ability to rescue his political standing, even among his own base. He’s been in a political slide for two months, and nothing he does to catch up is working.
There were reports on Thursday that the Trump campaign has pulled its TV advertising from the key swing state of Michigan. By Friday, his campaign admitted that it had hit “pause” in its national advertising strategy. Almost no Trump ads have been scheduled to run in August, the month the Republican National Convention is scheduled to take place. And plans for September are on hold as well.
Trump began to hold daily coronavirus briefings again last week and his poll numbers haven’t budged. People aren’t reacting to his bluster and lies. They haven’t been moved by Trump calling Portland protesters “anarchists” and “agitators” who “hate our country.” Nothing Trump says about the coronavirus matters. What matters is what’s happening out there in the country, where red states are experiencing steep spikes in cases and deaths from the virus.
People aren’t affected by Trump anymore. They’re affected by reality. They are worried about the virus. They’re worried about their jobs. They’re worried that they can’t travel to visit their relatives. They’re worried about their rent and their mortgages. They’re worried about losing federal unemployment benefits, which ended this week. They’re worried about whether or not to send their children back to school. The things people have done to protect themselves aren’t working. Being a citizen of a red state doesn’t work. Living in suburbia rather than an inner city doesn’t work. Private schools are as vulnerable as public schools. Corporate jobs are as vulnerable as blue-collar or gig economy jobs. Graduating from Harvard won’t keep you from getting sick. Being a politician or a professional athlete or a famous entertainer won’t protect you.
People want to know when they’re going to get their lives back, and Donald Trump doesn’t have an answer for them.
What’s going to happen over the next 95 days? What’s happening right now gives us a pretty good answer. The virus is out of control and will continue to spread. Trump is desperate and will continue to act in increasingly unstable ways. He will reward his friends and use the levers of power, such as the Department of Justice, against his enemies. He will continue to act like a fascist because he is a fascist.
Trump is losing it because he is losing. He doesn’t know anything else. It’s who he is.

0,2020-08-01T00:01:25+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/trumps-tanking-in-the-polls-and-he-thinks-the-problem-is-his-message/,Trump’s tanking in the polls — and he thinks the problem is his message,"In yet another sign Donald Trump’s internal polls aren’t all they’re cracked up to be, the Trump campaign has halted ad spending over the next few days due to their “messaging strategy,” because that’s clearly the problem.
Following the campaign shakeup in mid-July, a senior campaign official sought to frame the cessation as completely par for the course. “There’s understandably a review and fine-tuning of the campaign’s strategy,” the official told CNN, adding that they would be back on the air “shortly.”
While the initial advertising focused on featuring Trump’s accomplishments, the latest ads have taken a darker turn as Trump’s reelection chances dim and the candidate descends into a sea of self-pity and petty grievances.
In one recent campaign ad, a phone rings repeatedly until a voice mail indicates the caller has reached 911 but “no one is here to take your call” and the “estimated wait time is currently 5 days.” It’s a swipe at Trump’s desperate bid to portray Joe Biden as soft on crime and eager to defund the police. “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America,” a narrator concludes.
But the notion that the fundamental problem here can be solved by a little message tweaking is quite frankly a laughable proposition. There’s no messaging on earth that can divert attention away from the fact that the campaign’s candidate is a mentally incompetent racist whose constant grifting, lethal science denial, penchant for conspiracy theories, and Putin worship has doomed America’s pandemic response, wrecked our economy, and cost more than 150,000 American lives while rendering the U.S. functionally irrelevant on the world stage.
Exhibit A was Trump’s “pivot” toward a more somber tone last week engineered by the campaign’s new manager, Bill Stepien. Within days, that messaging pivot suffered a quick death as Trump started touting the completely unproven medicinal value of hydroxycholorquine and promoting a bunch of quack doctors downplaying social distancing and mask wearing as an effective way to combat the pandemic’s spread.
Presumably, Trump’s fascist tweets about delaying the election also weren’t part of the new messaging tweaks by the campaign. And therein lies the problem with trying to message one’s way out of an electoral deficit when Trump’s the messenger in chief. “It’s China’s fault” isn’t going to cut it as a reelection slogan.

0,2020-07-31T23:26:16+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/why-the-idea-of-jobless-benefits-scares-the-conservative-mind/,Why the idea of jobless benefits scares the conservative mind,"When Congress passed the CARES Act earlier this year, lawmakers gave some low-wage Americans who lost their jobs an income they’ve been demanding for years: $600 a week, which works out to $15 an hour for a 40-hour workweek. Because the federal minimum wage is less than half that rate—stuck there due to the intransigence of conservatives waging a class war against the poor—the coronavirus pandemic ironically gave the bottom rung of the American workforce a taste of what they could have had all along. So popular was this $600 in jobless benefits that even some Republicans who had voted against that provision in the CARES Act boasted about it to their constituents and failed to mention that like most of their GOP colleagues, they had initially opposed the provision.
The main conservative argument against paying unemployed workers $600 a week is that employers who try to entice them back into the workforce—whether it is safe or not—will have to compete with the government payments. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said out loud, “we don’t want to make it more profitable to stay home than to go back to work.” Think about that: the yearly salary equivalent of this supposedly generous benefit works out to just over $31,000 a year. If employers are unable to compete with such a low salary, there is something deeply wrong with our economy. In Los Angeles where I live, the amount does not even cover rent for a two-bedroom apartment.
Still, so underpaid are American workers that the $600-a-week in benefits, in addition to the one-time stimulus checks of $1,200, buoyed the entire economy as people actually began spending the cash. By May of this year, spending was up by 8.2 percent after falling dramatically in the two months before. According to an Associated Press report in late June, “The federal money has pumped nearly $20 billion a week into the economy and enabled many of the unemployed to stay afloat.” According to one estimate, the benefits comprise 15 percent of all wages in the nation, and “unemployed people are spending more than they did before the pandemic, while those who have jobs are spending less.”
At about the same time, spending by the richest Americans fell. Credit card use declined dramatically in the first half of the year—a trend that was directly attributed to the nation’s wealthiest people. Those businesses most dependent on selling pre-pandemic-era luxury goods and services to rich folks suffered the most. One study tracked the correlation, concluding that, “Declines in high-income spending led to significant employment losses among low-income individuals working in the most affluent ZIP codes in the country.”
The broader conclusion from such a study is that the wages of the working poor are far too dependent on the luxury spending of the wealthiest—a clear sign of the deep rot in the American economy as wealth and income inequality have continued to increase year after year. Had conservative lawmakers not stood in the way of increasing the federal minimum wage beyond $7.25 an hour, it is likely that the COVID-19 crisis would have had a lesser economic impact on the poorest Americans.
Conservative talking points for years warned against an economic apocalypse resulting from a higher minimum wage, saying that corporations would cut jobs—as if under the current status quo they are keeping on more workers than they actually need. Such notions have done deep damage to the economy.
Perhaps what the economic elites are really terrified of is that Americans might get used to being paid at least $600 a week. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow admitted that, “We’re paying people not to work. It’s better than their salaries would get.” Kudlow seems far more willing to give Americans one-time checks to entice them to return to their low-paying jobs rather than provide steady and relatively decent incomes for the long term.
Kudlow and other wealthy elites have had an ever-increasing influence over the nation’s economic policy, and under Donald Trump’s administration, that influence has deepened. Trump had justified his choices of various billionaires for top cabinet posts saying, “I want people that made a fortune because now they’re negotiating with you.” It should come as no surprise then that Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is worth about $400 million, complained about jobless workers being overpaid. He said on Fox News, “It wouldn’t be fair to use taxpayer dollars to pay more people to sit home than they would get working and get a job.” Mnuchin has no standing to defend taxpayers considering that he has sheltered his own income in offshore tax havens.
In fact, Yale researchers found that the government assistance did not artificially depress employment rates and that it, “neither encouraged layoffs during the pandemic’s onset nor deterred people from returning to work once businesses began reopening.” What the relatively generous jobless benefits have done is to finally spark a national conversation about putting a floor on wages. Now that a portion of the workforce has experienced an income that amounts to $15 an hour, there will be a greater public appetite for boosting wages. Moreover, the pandemic has offered a chance for economists all over the world to study the effects of what has amounted to a large-scale experiment of the kind that proponents of a Universal Basic Income have wanted to conduct for years.
Supporters of an economy based on consumerism ought to embrace the idea. If tax dollars ensure that the poorest Americans have a basic income, it is likely to stabilize consumer spending. Even some billionaires see value in the idea. Tilman Fertitta, a restaurateur and owner of the Houston Rockets, said, “You’re going to see this economy go backwards when we cut out this $600 a week.”
One would imagine that President Trump, who has based his reelection strategy on a strong economy, would support such a policy. But the ideology that a basic income represents contradicts the relentless Republican attacks on government “socialism.” If the government were to rig the economy in favor of poor Americans instead of wealthy elites and corporations (as is now the case), it would open the door to popular programs such as Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and of course an increase in the federal minimum wage. And that appears to be the biggest concern for the capitalist ideologues who are setting current policy.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., refused to answer questions about whether he received damaging information about presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden during a closed-door House Intelligence Committee hearing on Wednesday.
Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., brought up news reports that materials intended to damage Biden as part of a “foreign disinformation plot” were sent to Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, and other senior Republican lawmakers by Kremlin-linked Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach, according to a transcript of the meeting released by the panel.
Maloney asked whether Nunes was “prepared to disclose to the committee whether he has received” those materials and “whether he is prepared to share them with the rest of the committee.”
“Does the ranking member wish to respond?” Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., asked.
“No,” Nunes replied.
Maloney continued to press for an “explanation” from Nunes on why he was “not prepared to respond to a simple question whether he has received materials that have been called into question that seem to denigrate a former vice president.”
Maloney noted that the committee staff was already in possession of “evidence that a package was received.”
The committee’s Democratic majority learned that Nunes had received the materials after a DHL shipping receipt was sent to the majority’s office instead, according to Politico. Officials told the outlet they asked for access to the material, but Nunes had refused to share it. Democrats reported the package to the FBI in January.
“I guess this is a case where silence speaks volumes,” Maloney replied when Nunes did not respond to repeated questions from the Democrat on Wednesday.
Republicans on the panel later complained that Maloney’s questioning was “very rude.”
“Members don’t question other members in hearings,” Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., told Breitbart News. “This wasn’t on the agenda for the meeting. It was really inappropriate in my opinion and pretty childish.”
The outlet reported that lawyers for the House Republicans might bring ethics claims against Maloney.
However, Crawford appeared to confirm in the interview that Nunes had received a foreign package and turned it over to the FBI.
“It’s standard practice that if you get a package from unknown source in a foreign country, it’s probably a good idea to call the FBI and let them handle it, and not handle those packages and don’t open them and go, ‘Hey I wonder what this is? I guess it’s Christmas came early this year,'” Crawford said. “No, you follow the protocol, which is you turn that over to the FBI. That’s what happened.”
Maloney rejected the Republican claim that he was out of line.
“Russians are still trying to interfere in the election using bogus claims about events in Ukraine, so I don’t know what the secret is,” he told Politico. “‘What’s in the box?’ is my question. Just show us, and explain why it’s some big secret. We’ve literally got the receipts. The committee received this material. Why wouldn’t he share it?”
Democratic congressional leaders sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray earlier this month about details surrounding the packages, which were also sent to Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who also serves on the committee, and then-White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, according to Politico.
The material was sent to the Republicans in January amid the Senate’s impeachment trial, which focused on Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to help damage Biden ahead of the election. Democrats told Politico that they had not received a response from the FBI about the packages in the six months since they first informed the bureau.
Democrats have become increasingly concerned about Derkach, who met with Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last December and has since publicly released tapes of Biden’s discussions with Ukrainian officials and held a news conference “publicly declaring his efforts to unite with GOP officials to take down the former vice president,” according to the report.
Derkach told Politico last week that he had sent the materials in hopes of “creating an interparliamentary association called ‘Friends of Ukraine STOP Corruption.'”
He said he had also notified Graham, Grassley, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., about the materials and his news conferences. Graham, Grassley, Peters and Wyden “indicated they never received materials from Derkach,” according to the outlet.
Democrats said in their letter to the FBI that the materials were part of a foreign effort to interfere in the presidential election to help Trump.
The exchange with Nunes on Wednesday came as the committee voted to release a classified addendum about the interference effort to the full House of Representatives, which Nunes adamantly opposed.
“This document contains extremely sensitive information that Democrats will leak if the document is made available to the full House. That is a fact, and that is the intent,” Nunes said. “In fact, some of this information may have already been leaked — a matter I hope the FBI is investigating.”
Derkach also listed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as one of the Republicans to whom he sought to deliver information. Pompeo was asked about Derkach during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.
“I don’t want to comment on any particular individual like Mr. Derkach,” Pompeo said. “I will say this: We’re taking seriously the threats that Russia will try to engage in disinformation campaigns . . .  There’s still work ongoing ,and there’s still unsettled intelligence around these things.”
But several people mentioned by Derkach in his allegations have been called to testify by Jonson, who is investigating Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, which was what Trump pressed Ukraine to do before he was impeached.
Democrats have called Johnson’s investigation a “laundering” effort for a foreign interference campaign to damage Biden.
“We’re gathering information, but I’m not aware of anything that is Russian disinformation,” Johnson told CNN. “We’re going to vet, we’re going to validate everything we do.”
Democratic leaders expressed concern about the investigation in their letter to Wray.
“We are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign,” they wrote, “which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate and the presidential election in November.”

Trump suggested delaying the election on Thursday amid plummeting poll numbers and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 150,000 people and caused the largest GDP drop in U.S. history. Trump has no power to postpone the election, and the idea was roundly rejected by Republican lawmakers. At the same time, many members of the GOP have expressed similar concerns about mail-in voting as the president.
“With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,” Trump claimed without evidence.
Some states have long used all-mail elections. There have been more than 250 million ballots cast by mail in the last 20 years, and only 143 prosecutions related to mail ballot fraud, or a rate of about 0.00006%.
Trump later reiterated that he opposed “mail-in-voting” but “totally” supports “absentee voting,” even though they are the same thing. Trump and many of his aides have repeatedly voted by mail themselves.
Trump and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, for example, have claimed that they voted “absentee” in Florida. But there is no “absentee” voting in Florida. Instead, the state has a “no excuse” vote-by-mail system that allows anyone to cast a ballot by mail for any reason.
Trump’s own lawyers acknowledged that there is no difference between “mail-in voting” and “absentee voting” in a lawsuit challenging Pennsylvania’s mail voting rules last month.
Attorneys for the Trump campaign noted that while some states have different wording regarding the terminology, “the terms ‘mail-in’ and ‘absentee’ are used interchangeably to discuss the use of the United States Postal Service to deliver ballots to and from electors” in a lawsuit available in full on the president’s website.
Marc Elias, a lawyer for the Democratic Party who frequently argues election cases in court, told MSNBC on Thursday that “there is no distinction” between the two terms.
“They are synonyms,” he said. “Some states tend to use the term ‘mail-in.’ Some states tend to use the term ‘absentee.’ Sometimes, within a state, the statutes will refer to both. But they are both the same. They are both processes by which people who don’t want to show up to the polls in person can receive in the mail a ballot . . . that they either mail back or deliver through some other mechanism to election officials. There is no difference.”
Trump’s complaints appear to be based on the premise that mail voters typically have to request and fill out a form in order to obtain a mail-in ballot, but some states are sending every eligible voter an application in anticipation of a surge in mail voting due to the pandemic.
The president falsely claimed on Thursday that states were sending out “hundreds of millions of universal mail-in ballots.”
Aside from the fact that there are not “hundreds of millions” of voters in the country, only California, which Trump lost by 31 points in 2016, plans to send absentee ballots to voters. Though Trump has falsely accused other states like Michigan of sending everyone a ballot, Michigan is one of a handful of states that is sending applications — not ballots — to eligible voters. There is not a single state that is sending ballots or applications to anyone who is not registered to vote.
Trump and Attorney General William Barr have also floated conspiracy theories that these ballots could possibly be tampered with or forged, but these baseless claims have been refuted by Republican state officials. There are numerous safeguards in place, including bar codes and signature verification.
Beverly Clarno, Oregon’s Republican secretary of state, told CBS News that the state’s system uses unique barcodes for each ballot it sends out. Kim Wyman, Washington’s Republican secretary of state, told The New York Times that “vote-by-mail has a lot of security measures.”
“At the end of the day, all voting systems are like banks,” she said. “You build a lot of things in to protect from fraud. You build in a lot of measures to detect it. But ultimately, if somebody wants to commit fraud, or if someone wants to rob a bank, they can. And then we have measures on the back end to prosecute that criminal activity. So you hope to deter it, and you hope it doesn’t happen. But if it does, you have ways to deal with it.”
Pressed on his false claims about mail voting on Thursday, Trump spun a new narrative arguing that he does not want election results to be delayed.
“I don’t want to see an election — you know, so many years, I’ve been watching elections. And they say the ‘projected winner’ or the ‘winner of the election’ — I don’t want to see that take place in a week after Nov. 3, or a month or frankly — with litigation and everything else that can happen — years,” Trump claimed. “Years. Or you never even know who won the election.”
Election experts rejected the idea that counting mailed-in ballots, which happens in every election, would delay the election for years.
“That’s not new. We’ve had absentee voting in this country for a long time,” Elias told MSNBC. “We regularly don’t have all the ballots counted on election night.”
“Any state should be able to count votes-by-mail and verify it within a month unless something derails the system,” Edward Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University, told The Hill.
“We should get ready for the fact that we may not know who won on Election Night,” added Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School. “But there’s a process for counting and a process for fighting over the count. And the Constitution says that all of that is over — full stop — well before noon on Jan. 20.”

0,2020-07-31T22:13:47+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/5-key-takeaways-from-dr-faucis-hopeful-but-cautious-testimony-about-19/,5 key takeaways from Dr. Fauci’s hopeful — but cautious — testimony about COVID-19,"On Friday morning,  leading infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and other members of the White House coronavirus task force testified before a House subcommittee on the Trump administration’s coronavirus response. The hearing took place as more than 150,000 lives have been lost to the novel coronavirus and the country leads the world in total cases with over 4 million Americans infected.
Despite these grim numbers, some states continue to reopen, and many are planning on sending kids back to school this fall. The piecemeal approach to control the virus in the U.S. has been scrutinized and the subject of debate, especially as other countries have seemingly managed to control its spread and lower the number of infections.
Fauci, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Adm. Brett Giroir, addressed concerns about vaccine development, the inability to contain the virus in the U.S., and more at the hearing. In case you missed it, here’s what happened:
1. Dr. Fauci says it’s “not dreaming” that a vaccine will be here in 2021
A sigh of relief came at Dr. Fauci’s optimism when Rep. Maloney (D-NY) questioned if it’s “dreaming” to believe if a vaccine will be available next year.
“We feel cautiously optimistic that we will have a vaccine by the end of this year and as we go into 2021,” Dr. Fauci said. “So I don’t think it’s dreaming, Congresswoman.”
Rep. Maloney also asked if safety standards and scientific integrity are being compromised for speed. Dr. Fauci reiterated that is not the case.
“As I’ve said often and I’ll repeat it for the record now: There’s never a guarantee that you’re going to get a safe and effective vaccine, but from everything we’ve seen now, in the animal data, as well as the early human data,” Dr. Fauci said.
People have often been skeptical about a vaccine actually arriving, especially since it would be the fastest vaccine to be made and distributed in history. Some have pointed to HIV, and the struggle to find a vaccine for that virus, wondering how can one for COVID-19 be made so soon? Dr. Fauci said the two viruses can’t be compared.
“I think the difference between HIV and coronavirus is so different that I don’t think you can compare them, because the body does not make a very good immune response against HIV so it makes vaccine development very difficult,” Dr. Fauci said. “Whereas the body does make a robust immune response against coronavirus which tells us that I believe that we can get to that goal.”
2. However, not every American will get the vaccine right away
Despite the expected arrival of the vaccine, not everyone can have access immediately. Instead, it’s likely be distributed in phases, but that every American will eventually be able to get it within 2021.
“I believe ultimately over a period of time in 2021, if we have — and I think we will have — a safe and effective vaccine, that Americans will be able to get it,” he said. “I don’t think that we’ll have everybody getting it immediately in the beginning. It probably will be phased in. And that’s the reason why we have the committees to do the prioritization of who should get it first. But ultimately, within a reasonable period of time, the plans now allow for any American who needs a vaccine to get it within the year 2021.”
Dr. Fauci added that the U.S. government is taking a “financial risk” to start developing doses of vaccines that have yet to be approved in safety and efficacy.
“We’re taking a risk, a financial risk, not safety risk but financial risk.,” Dr. Fauci. “The development of doses of vaccine, right now as we speak, so that they will be ready by the time we do show safety and efficacy, we’ll be able to distribute it and it will be done by a number of mechanisms.”
3. The U.S. is struggling to contain the virus because the country never fully shut down
When Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) asked why Europe has managed to control the virus, and the U.S. hasn’t, Dr. Fauci said it’s because when the European Union shut down, about 95% of the region actually shuttered its doors.
“When you actually look at what we did, even though we shut down and even though it created a great deal of difficulty, we really functionally shut down only about 50% in the sense of the totality of the country, which means when we reached our peak, as they did they came down almost to a low baseline,” Dr. Fauci explained. “We started off with a very difficult baseline of transmission that was going on at the time that we tried to open up the country, what we saw particularly most recently in the southern states was an increase of cases to 20, 30, 40, 50 thousand, and a couple of weeks ago it was up to 70,000 per day and now it’s down between 50 and 60, and the reasons for that are complex.”
Dr. Fauci also noted that some states followed the suggested guidelines to reopen, while others didn’t.
4. Dr. Fauci is cautious about Russia’s alleged vaccine
As CNN reported, Russia intends to be the first county in the world to approve a vaccine within the next two weeks. China has also been making rapid progress on a vaccine, according to various reports. Despite those advances, Dr. Fauci doesn’t think the U.S. will have to “depend” on other countries for a vaccine though.
“I do not believe that there will be vaccines so far ahead of us that we will have to depend on other countries to get us vaccines,” Dr. Fauci said. “I believe the program that is being sponsored by us right now, and being directed and implemented by us, is going at a very rapid speed — prudent, but rapid.”
Dr. Fauci added he hopes other countries are taking the necessary precautions before actually using the vaccine.
“I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccine before they are administering the vaccine to anyone,” he said. “Because claims of having a vaccine, ready to distribute before you do testing, I think, is problematic, at best.”
5. Dr. Fauci won’t get caught up in Rep. Jim Jordan’s bipartisan drama
Conservative Rep. Jordan of Ohio used his inquiry time to try and trap Dr. Fauci into condemning protests for Black Lives Matter.
“Should we limit the protesting?” Jordan asked. “You make all kinds of recommendations. You make comments on dating, on baseball and everything you could imagine.”
Fauci declined to engage.
“I’m not favoring anybody over anybody,” Fauci replied. “I’m not going to opine on limiting anything . . .  I’m telling you what is the danger, and you can make your own conclusion about that. You should stay away from crowds, no matter where the crowds are.”

0,2020-07-31T21:41:55+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/watch-fauci-laughs-as-republican-jim-jordan-attempts-to-get-him-to-call-for-banning-protests/,Watch: Fauci laughs as Republican Jim Jordan attempts to get him to call for banning protests,"Rep. Jim Jordan clashed with Dr. Anthony Fauci on Friday during a House hearing about the current status of White House efforts to stem the coronavirus pandemic. The confrontation resulted in the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases smiling and laughing at the Ohio Republican as he tried to drag the doctor into a political debate about Black Lives Matter protesters.
Jordan came right out of chute ranting about protests and trying to get the doctor to call for the halting of public protests — something Fauci said was not his call.
“Dr. Fauci, do protests increase the spread of the virus?” Jordan pressed. “Half a million protesters on June 6th alone, I’m asking that number of people, does it increase the spread of the virus?”
“Crowding together particularly when you’re not wearing a mask contributes to the spread of the virus,” the doctor carefully replied.
“Should we limit the protesting?” Jordan persisted.
“I’m not sure what you mean should — how do we say limit the protesting? I don’t think that’s relevant,” the doctor replied.
“Well, you just said if it increases the spread of the virus, I’m asking should we limit it?” the Republican asked.
“Well, I’m not in a position what a government can do in a forceful way,” Fauci advised,
That was when Jordan went off on a rant, loudly asserting, “You make all kind of recommendations. You made comments on dating and baseball and everything you can imagine. You just said protests increase the spread — should we try to limit the protest?”
“No, I think I would leave that to people who are more in a position to do that,” Fauci replied while beginning to smile and look from side to side as Jordan went off on a rant about churches being forced to close, finally answering the congressman and telling him, “I’m not favoring of anybody over anybody. I’m just making a statement that’s a broad statement that avoid crowds of any type no matter where you are because that leads to the acquisition and transmission, and I don’t judge one crowd versus another crowd. when you’re in a crowd, particularly if you’re not wearing a mask.”

0,2020-07-31T21:24:28+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/obama-got-in-some-good-trouble-for-his-john-lewis-eulogy/,Obama got in some good trouble for his John Lewis eulogy,"One of the funniest comedy routines from the Obama presidency was the one created by Key and Peele about Obama’s anger translator. But at one point in the former president’s eulogy for John Lewis, he demonstrated that he didn’t need an anger translator, because he brought it himself.
Obama went on to say that it wasn’t enough to acknowledge that John Lewis was a hero.
You want to honor John? Let’s honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for. And by the way, naming it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, that is a fine tribute. But John wouldn’t want us to stop there, trying to get back to where we already were. Once we pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, we should keep marching to make it even better.
By making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including former inmates who’ve earned their second chance.
By adding polling places, and expanding early voting, and making Election Day a national holiday, so if you are someone who is working in a factory, or you are a single mom who has got to go to her job and doesn’t get time off, you can still cast your ballot.
By guaranteeing that every American citizen has equal representation in our government, including the American citizens who live in Washington, D.C. and in Puerto Rico. They are Americans.
By ending some of the partisan gerrymandering — so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians, not the other way around.
And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster — another Jim Crow relic — in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that’s what we should do.
On a day that the current president was spreading lies about mail-in voting and tossing out the idea of delaying the election, the former president was outlining an agenda to ensure that every American has access to the franchise and the elimination of anti-democratic barriers. But in a perfect example of the media’s obsession with “both sides do it,” the headline at ABC news read:”Presidents offer dueling views on country’s voting systems.” In other words,  they equated a powerful defense of voting rights with voter suppression.
In the video clip above, Obama indicated that he knew what was coming when he said this:
Now, I know this is a celebration of John’s life. There are some who might say we shouldn’t dwell on such things. But that’s why I’m talking about it. John Lewis devoted his time on this Earth fighting the very attacks on democracy and what’s best in America that we are seeing circulate right now.
The fact that Obama went there anyway was not only an affirmation of Lewis’s commitment to voting rights, it was an example of what it means to get in “good trouble.” That is because Republicans have made voting rights—the very foundation of our democratic republic—a partisan issue. So right on cue, Tucker Carlson called Obama a “greasy politician” who “desecrated” Lewis’s funeral by engaging in “partisan talking points.”
The reason why the Key and Peele routine was so funny is that Barack Obama has always been slow to anger. But he once described himself as a counter-puncher, saying that if people abuse that, he “will crush them”—acknowledging that last part was a joke … sort of. So when Republicans adopt a partisan agenda that strikes at the very heart of our democratic processes, Obama got in some good trouble. I suspect that John Lewis would approve.

One of them still isn’t old enough to vote but is being charged as an adult.
The hack was so expertly done that the hackers managed to take over the accounts of former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, among many others. These accounts then tweeted out instructions for viewers to send bitcoin to the hackers.
According to a DOJ press release, 19-year-old Mason Sheppard — who is from Bognor Regis in the U.K. — and 22-year-old Orlando, Florida resident Nima Fazeli were both charged in the Northern District of California. Fazeli has been charged with “aiding and abetting the intentional access of a protected computer,” while Sheppard has been charged with “conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and the intentional access of a protected computer.”
“The hackers are alleged to have created a scam bitcoin account, to have hacked into Twitter VIP accounts, to have sent solicitations from the Twitter VIP accounts with a false promise to double any bitcoin deposits made to the scam account, and then to have stolen the bitcoin that victims deposited into the scam account,” the DOJ said. “As alleged in the complaints, the scam bitcoin account received more than 400 transfers worth more than $100,000.”
The press release did not name the third person, who is only 17 and was arrested in Tampa, Florida and will be charged as an adult. According to Sean Hollister, a reporter for The Verge, the 17-year-old was arrested by “the FBI, IRS, U.S. Secret Service and Florida law enforcement.” Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren said of the youth, “This was not an ordinary 17-year old.”
In the DOJ’s press release, federal prosecutor David L. Anderson is quoted as saying: “There is a false belief within the criminal hacker community that attacks like the Twitter hack can be perpetrated anonymously and without consequence. Today’s charging announcement demonstrates that the elation of nefarious hacking into a secure environment for fun or profit will be short-lived. Criminal conduct over the internet may feel stealthy to the people who perpetrate it, but there is nothing stealthy about it. In particular, I want to say to would-be offenders: break the law, and we will find you.”

0,2020-07-31T19:56:58+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/nyc-mayors-staffers-are-fleeing-as-he-gets-slammed-for-letting-the-cops-run-over-him-and-the-entire-city/,NYC mayor’s staffers are fleeing as he gets slammed for ‘letting the cops run over him and the entire city’,"When Democrat Bill de Blasio was elected mayor of New York City in 2013, criminal justice reform had been a prominent theme of his campaign. But in recent weeks, the NYC mayor has received criticism from some liberals and progressives for his handling of the George Floyd protests in NYC. And Gothamist reporter Jake Offenhartz reports that “at least six high-ranking staffers” have announced their departures from his administration this month.
A former staffer, quoted anonymously in Gothamist, complained that de Blasio “is now completely letting the cops run over him and the entire city, and that is not what I signed up for.”
Recent departures from de Blasio’s administration, Offenhartz notes, include Communications Director Wiley Norvell, spokesperson Freddi Goldstein, Deputy Communications Director Deidrea Miller, speechwriter Jeff Sutton and deputy press secretaries Olivia Lapeyrolerie and Jane Meyer. And those departures followed the departure of Senior Advisor Alison Hirsh in June.
Bill Neidhardt, who now works in de Blasio’s press office, downplayed the importance of the June and July departures —telling Gothamist, “It’s a natural time for transition, especially for staff who helped New York make it through a time of historic crisis.”
Neidhardt, of course, was referring to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed thousands of New York City residents. NYC was the coronavirus epicenter of the U.S. back in the spring.
But the pandemic isn’t the only challenge that NYC has faced this year. The city has also been rocked by huge protests in response to Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on May 25. And according to Offenhartz, “Multiple City Hall staffers said that the mayor’s handling of the protests sparked by George Floyd’s death factored into the decision to step down.”
“Current staffers,” Offenhartz reports, “described feeling demoralized by de Blasio’s unwavering support of the NYPD and Commissioner (Dermot) Shea. After plain-clothes officers were seen on video this week throwing a teenage activist into an unmarked minivan, one current aide wondered why the mayor hadn’t pushed the NYPD to disavow the arrest. That aide told Gothamist, ‘Why wasn’t the van going after murder and shooting suspects instead of a person accused of criminal mischief? It’s beyond reason.’”
In June, Offenhartz notes, over 400 current and former members of de Blasio’s administration signed a letter “denouncing the mayor’s treatment of peaceful protesters, and accusing him of betraying his campaign promises to stand up to the police department.”
Rebecca Katz, a former de Blasio adviser, was highly critical of the New York Police Department, telling Gothamist, “There’s a disturbing disconnect between the police reforms de Blasio ran on as a candidate versus the police conduct de Blasio presides over as Mayor. What progressive can defend that?”
In 2013, de Blasio became the first person to win a mayoral race in NYC as a Democrat since David Dinkins in 1989. A former member of the New York City Council, de Blasio enjoyed a decisive victory when he ran for mayor in 2013 — and he was reelected by a landslide in 2017, defeating Republican challenger Nicole Malliotakis by 38%.

0,2020-07-31T19:41:37+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/jared-kushner-called-on-to-resign-after-damning-report-reveals-his-depravity/,Jared Kushner called on to resign after damning report reveals his ‘depravity’,"In the wake of devastating new reporting by Vanity Fair, a chorus of voices Friday called for the immediate resignation of Jared Kushner, a top White House advisor and the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, for disastrous—and deadly—failures by the administration that appear to have put the political desires of the president above the public health needs of the American people.
The Vanity Fair article takes an exhaustive look at decisions made and actions taken by a secretive task force led by Kushner that was charged with implementing an “aggressive, coordinated national COVID-19 response”—including a federal testing regime that would help stem the spread of the virus. What the investigation uncovered, according to reporter Katherine Eban, was an ultimately “aborted plan” for a far-reaching national testing strategy and a deliberative process that “began not with public health experts but with bankers and billionaires.”
While the plan itself devised by the team Kushner put together was characterized as “imperfect” but “a starting point,” the most shocking revelations have to do with why the strategy, which members of the unit believed would head straight to Trump’s desk and then be rolled out nationwide with large fanfare in early April, suddenly seemed to disappear—like “poof into thin air,” said one participant in the effort.
As Eban reports:
the prospect of launching a large-scale national plan was losing favor, said one public health expert in frequent contact with the White House’s official coronavirus task force.
Most troubling of all, perhaps, was a sentiment the expert said a member of Kushner’s team expressed: that because the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically. “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert.
That logic may have swayed Kushner. “It was very clear that Jared was ultimately the decision maker as to what [plan] was going to come out,” the expert said.
On April 27, Trump stepped to a podium in the Rose Garden, flanked by members of his coronavirus task force and leaders of America’s big commercial testing laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, and finally announced a testing plan: It bore almost no resemblance to the one that had been forged in late March, and shifted the problem of diagnostic testing almost entirely to individual states.
While the veracity of such claims cannot be verified—and Kushner refused to answer a detailed set of questions or be interviewed by Vanity Fair—the implications of such a decision speak for themselves and drew immediate outrage and a demand for accountability.
“Imagine the administration had intel on an imminent terrorist attack that would kill over 100,000 people, and chose to do nothing because it was politically easier,” tweeted Matt Duss, foreign policy advisor for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), on his personal account. “That’s what we have here. We need to be talking about accountability. For all of it.”
“So the White House made the explicit decision that it was a better political call to let people die in the blue states and blame the governors then try to fix the testing situation,” responded Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo.
Wajahat Ali, an op-ed contributor to the New York Times, indicated the seriousness of these accusations against Kushner should not be ignored.
“Jared Kushner has blood on his hands,” Ali stated. “And we should talk about this today.”
According to Duss, simply voting Trump out of office in November would not count as holding administration officials responsible for this kind of behavior.
“No, losing the election doesn’t qualify as accountability,” Duss said. “Over 100,000 Americans are dead because of these people’s incompetence and viciousness. I know the idea of prosecuting the previous administration makes some uncomfortable. Time to start getting over that.”

0,2020-07-31T19:17:58+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/a-failed-president-paul-krugman-lambasts-trump-as-the-quintessential-horrible-boss/,‘A failed president’: Paul Krugman lambasts Trump as the quintessential ‘horrible boss’,"This week, President Donald Trump has drawn widespread criticism for his outrageous suggestion that the United States should postpone its presidential election in order to avoid rampant voter fraud, which is a crisis only in Trump’s mind. Liberal economist Paul Krugman weighs in on the controversy in his New York Times column, equating Trump with the type of “horrible boss” and “every worker’s nightmare” who “refuses to step aside” despite the fact that “everything they handle turns to crud.”
“So, of course, he’s now talking about delaying the election,” Krugman writes. “This was predictable; indeed, Joe Biden predicted it months ago, amid much mockery from pundits — none of whom, I predict, will apologize.”
The good news, Krugman notes, is that Trump doesn’t have the power to order that the election he postponed — that isn’t one of the executive powers he has as president. But the bad news, according to Krugman, is that Trump can inflict damage in other ways.
“What Trump can do, if he loses, is claim that the election was stolen — that there were millions of fraudulent votes, that the results aren’t legitimate,” Krugman warns. “Hey, he did that after losing the popular vote in 2016, even though he won the Electoral College. Such antics almost surely wouldn’t let him stay in the White House…. but they could produce a lot of chaos and quite possibly, some violence across the nation. And anyone who doesn’t think disgruntled Trump supporters would try to sabotage a Biden administration — including its efforts to deal with the pandemic — hasn’t been paying attention.”
Comparing Trump to an “utterly incompetent boss” who will “pull out every stop, violate every norm, to stay in that corner office,” Krugman stresses that his response to the coronavirus pandemic has been disastrous from both a health standpoint and an economic standpoint.
“Has any previous president failed his big test as thoroughly as Trump has these past few months?” Krugman asks. “He rejected the advice of health experts and pushed for a rapid economic reopening, hoping for a boom leading into the election. He ridiculed and belittled measures that would have helped slow the spread of the coronavirus, including wearing face masks and practicing social distancing.”
Krugman adds that “over the past week, the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 averaged more than 1,000 people a day, compared with just four — four! — per day in Germany.”
Because of Trump’s “failed” response to the coronavirus pandemic, Krugman laments, the U.S. has “stumbled into a completely gratuitous economic crisis.”
The economist stresses, “Trump has completely botched his job, bringing unnecessary pain to millions of Americans and unnecessary death to thousands. He may not care, but voters do…. At this point, Trump is simply a failed president, and everyone except his diehard supporters knows it.”

0,2020-07-31T18:50:46+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-withdrawal-from-who-a-cover-up-for-his-abject-failures/,Trump’s withdrawal from WHO: A cover-up for his abject failures,"Microbes do not recognize borders. We are all safe only when everybody is safe. In a pandemic, to attack the only body we have for global cooperation endangers everyone. That is why the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) is dangerous not only for the United States, but for all of the world.
Trump’s decision to withdraw from the WHO is a continuation of his wielding a wrecking ball to the international framework of treaties and organizations. Whether it is arms control, climate change, trade or the WHO, the United States sees these agreements and institutions as fetters on its hegemonic powers to shape the world. Trump may express this pathology in its most ugly form, but the disease runs far deeper.
Trump’s excuse for withdrawing from the WHO is that it did not do its job well on the COVID-19 epidemic and was soft on China. Condemning Trump’s move, Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh and adviser to the Scottish government, tweeted, “Donald Trump’s withdrawal of U.S. from the WHO ignores the key role the agency plays in outbreak prevention and response. Not only for COVID, but also for polio, malaria, TB, plague, yellow fever, cholera, Zika virus, and neglected tropical diseases.” She also pointed out that it is because of such international agreements that the WHO received information from China on the novel pathogen on December 30, 2019, and declared the “highest alarm bell the world has”—a Public Health Emergency of International Concern—on January 30, 2020.
Trump is trying to pass the buck to the WHO for his administration’s abject failure to prepare the United States for the COVID-19 pandemic and its handling of the epidemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not even prepare a proper test kit for two months for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease. China, Germany and South Korea, to name a few, all had working test kits well before the CDC. One of these, Berlin’s Charité hospital test kit, has been supplied by the WHO to more than 120 countries. The WHO had delivered this test kit to 57 countries well before the CDC—with an annual budget almost three times WHO’s (the CDC’s annual budget is about $6.8 billion against the WHO’s two-year budget for 2020-2021 of about $4.8 billion)—could get its test kits to work.
The United States has a bipartisan unity on its being the sole global hegemon. Its wars of invasion—from Korea to Vietnam, Afghanistan to Iraq—have had bipartisan support. Its right wing, which in any other part of the world would be regarded as the loony right, believes that it can impose its will on the world through unilateral action: using military force and economic sanctions. The other side, the more globalist right—there is no left or centrist forces in the U.S. leadership of either party—believes that this hegemony can be exercised more easily with a combination of using the global institutions from within and unilateral action outside.
What Does the WHO Do, and What Are the Risks to the World of a U.S. Pullout?
Almost all countries have reposed their faith in the WHO as the only international instrument we have in fighting pandemics and infectious diseases. So the U.S. action will inflict some financial damage to the WHO, but it is not a threat to its existence or mandate.
The WHO has an annual budget of about $2.2-2.4 billion (its two-year budget for 2018-19 is $4.4 billion, and its two-year budget for 2020-21 is $4.8 billion). According to the WHO, about 80 percent of its budget is funded by “voluntary contributions” made by member countries as well as organizations including philanthropic foundations and the private sector. The remaining 20 percent is covered by what are called “assessed contributions” of countries. The assessed contribution of the United States is about $120 million for the year 2020. Based on the Congressional Research Service’s figures for U.S. voluntary contributions to the WHO from 2012 to 2018 (data is not available for 2019-2020, it says), it is my estimate that the U.S. voluntary contribution to the WHO for 2020 is about $320 million, and that, along with its assessed contribution of $120 million, is about 20 percent of the WHO’s current $2.2-2.4 billion annual budget.
Because the assessed contributions are too low to fund the WHO on their own, voluntary contributions from countries and private funders have become the major component of its budget. Consequently, the WHO has become progressively more dependent on private interest groups and country interests that then dominate its agenda. After the United States and the UK, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the third biggest contributor to the WHO’s total budget.
Compared to its mandate of health for all, and fighting disease and epidemics across the world, it is a measly budget. Just put the WHO budget numbers in perspective—as I mentioned above, the U.S. CDC’s annual budget is roughly three times bigger than that of the WHO. The WHO also has no powers over sovereign countries, and has to work with governments.
Even with these constraints, the WHO has had remarkable success in eradicating smallpox, bringing down the number of polio infections from the scourge they once were to today’s small numbers, and interventions in other infectious diseases. Controlling the Ebola epidemic required multi-country and multi-agency cooperation that would not have been possible without the WHO’s intervention (albeit its efforts had some critics). It is the only agency with technical competence, drawn from different regions, that can coordinate the efforts of different countries and their agencies.
Sure, we can criticize the WHO for its mistakes, initially on not advising the wearing of masks and not emphasizing the role of airborne fine droplets or aerosols in closed spaces. However, it raised the flag of pandemic early, it came out with clear recommendations on testing and tracking, and its multidisciplinary team worked with China to control the epidemic there, figuring out information essential to combat the virus and sharing it with the world.
A WHO report released on February 24 based on its collaboration with China made other countries aware that controlling the spread of COVID-19 required a more stringent protocol that is more like that of SARS than the flu. As a result, policy changes were made in countries like New Zealand. Countries who had experienced the 2003 SARS outbreak, such as Vietnam and South Korea, were already following SARS protocol of using masks, extensive testing and isolating those infected. Vietnam, in spite of a shared border with China, has controlled the epidemic completely and has not reported a single COVID-19 death.
Why is the WHO’s coordinating role so important? Unlike human populations, microbes have no borders. They travel not only locally through water and air, but also, in an interconnected world like ours, via passengers traveling by air, water or land. They infect animals and birds, both domesticated and in the wild. That is why quarantining the infected and isolating countries from others is only a short-term measure. The only long-term way to fight epidemics is either to eradicate it completely or to confine it to small pockets of outbreaks, through vaccines and other public health measures. This battle cannot be won by one country. That is why gutting the WHO, the only competent public health instrument of global cooperation we have, is a road to disaster.
While there have been many warnings that a new pandemic was inevitable, the flu virus was thought to be the major threat. Its ability to mutate rapidly, using reservoirs of domesticated animals—chickens and pigs—and migratory birds, has been recognized as a long-term pandemic threat. The memory of the 1918 influenza epidemic lent credit to the seriousness of the flu threat.
The WHO has created a global network and infrastructure that can monitor flu outbreaks all over the world. Its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), functioning for more than 65 years, identifies “novel influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens” and provides vital information for the upcoming season’s likely flu strains and vaccine composition recommendations. The GISRS is the only global platform that allows countries to share virus strains so that they can receive vaccines through the WHO’s programs at concessional rates, and not at the prohibitively expensive market rates for the poorer countries.
Which countries benefit from such a virus sharing platform? The bulk of influenza vaccines are used in the United States and western Europe. The United States uses more flu vaccine than any other country. Meanwhile, nearly 50 percent of the global population—Africa, West Asia, South Asia, and southeastern Asia—uses only 5 percent of the world’s flu vaccines, even though the bulk of flu samples come from these countries.
Walking out of the WHO leaves at risk not only the global flu program, but also our ability to fight a new influenza pandemic that can rival the one in 1918. At that time it killed an estimated 50-100 million people (15-20 million of those casualties were in British India alone). Since the world’s population was about one-fourth of our current numbers, this would mean a casualty of 200-400 million by today’s count, even without factoring in the effects of modern travel’s ability to speed up the spread of contagions.
No matter where a disease begins, stopping the spread at the source before it becomes a pandemic also protects the populations of other countries. Why then would the United States pull out when it is the net beneficiary of the WHO’s disease monitoring and prevention program?
The right wing opposes public health policies in favor of individual-centric, privatized health care, with Big Pharma mopping up huge profits from life-saving medicines. This remains the case now, even though a pandemic can only be successfully fought at the global level. Public health yields immeasurable profits for society, but not for private hospitals or Big Pharma.
The WHO, with its warts and all, still stands for global cooperation and fostering public health policies, and is the only instrument we have for global cooperation. It is hated by the right wing precisely for these reasons. The right-wing friends of Trump—Jair Bolsonaro, Boris Johnson and Narendra Modi—do not criticize the United States for quitting the WHO, even though their countries need the WHO as much as the rest of the world. The attitude that every person must be for themselves, and every country for itself, is a part of their worldview as well.

He’s more Trumpy than ever.
When the last round of terrible polls were released, showing Trump badly trailing Joe Biden both nationwide and in the key battleground states, Kellyanne Conway and others inexplicably suggested that the president should reignite the dumpster fire formerly known as the coronavirus briefings. That’s not going well. Have they been as bad as the White House coronavirus rallies in the spring, where Trump spent what seemed like hours every day insulting the press corps and generally making a fool of himself? Not yet. But that’s only because he has managed to stick to answering a few questions after droning on for 20 minutes as if he were reading someone else’s book report.
The substance of that book report is the same old happy talk and cheerleading, virtually always based on half-truths and outright lies. And the Q&A period is predictably a disaster. One day he wished his old friend Ghislaine Maxwell, the accused sex trafficker, well, spurring speculation that he was sending her the kind of signal he had earlier sent to his pal Roger Stone, whose sentence he commuted after Stone made clear he hadn’t ratted him out. (Perhaps that’s unfair, but since Trump commonly says things that sound like a slightly less erudite Tony Soprano, it’s only natural to wonder.)
When it comes to dealing with the pandemic, Trump just keeps stepping in it, regardless of what’s in his prepared text. This week he came close to reprising the memorable moment when he asked the scientists to look into using disinfectant to clean out people’s lungs, since it cleans countertops so well. Responding to what was reportedly a coordinated campaign to push hydroxychloroquine, his favorite miracle cure, the president endorsed a quack doctor who has a history of making bizarre claims, including a belief that doctors are injecting alien DNA into their patients and that various reproductive disorders are the consequence of “dream sex” with witches and demons. He said he was very impressed by her.
If Trump actually allowed his public health officers to run the briefings, he might get credit for having a competent professional administration, but he cannot tolerate anyone else getting the attention. In fact, this week featured perhaps the most immature whine he’s ever delivered, and that’s really saying something:
He simply cannot grasp that his performance during this pandemic has shown him to be incapable of handling a crisis, which is the single most important duty of the president. Nor is he willing to delegate the task to others, which makes his embarrassing incompetence all the more conspicuous. And he seems not to understand that his reckless flailing in pursuit of something that might aid his dwindling chances of re-election is entirely transparent.
Trump at the podium spewing misinformation to the public isn’t the only problem. The policies that have been pursued by his administration are blatantly corrupt. Katherine Eban at Vanity Fair reported on a previously unknown shocking decision made back in April.
We knew that there were various people working on the same issue on separate tracks in the White House. There was the official coronavirus task force, the recently revealed political group that met privately in chief of staff Mark Meadows’ office, and the notorious Jared Kushner task force that operated completely independently.
According to Eban, Kushner’s group of whiz kids actually worked up a somewhat sophisticated and comprehensive national testing and tracing program all the way back in April:
Rather than have states fight each other for scarce diagnostic tests and limited lab capacity, the plan would have set up a system of national oversight and coordination to surge supplies, allocate test kits, lift regulatory and contractual roadblocks, and establish a widespread virus surveillance system by the fall, to help pinpoint subsequent outbreaks.
Who knows if their plan would have worked? This is the Trump administration after all. But the people involved were under the impression that it had been approved and that the president would announce it in a Rose Garden briefing in early April. Obviously, that didn’t happen, and the reasons it didn’t are appalling.
As we know, the president never wanted to do a lot of testing because he didn’t want to see “his numbers” go up, so he was no doubt reluctant from the beginning. During this time he was obsessed with the stock market and the economic cost of the shutdowns, which he believed were hurting his re-election chances. This was right around the period when Dr. Deborah Birx was passing around her optimistic models showing that the virus was rapidly running its course.
But this is a new detail:
[B]ecause the virus had hit blue states hardest, a national plan was unnecessary and would not make sense politically. “The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy,” said the expert.
In other words, the Rube Goldberg system that has allowed the virus to surge all over the country resulting in millions of cases and more than 150,000 deaths was understood months ago to be unworkable. But people close to the president of the United States believed that the virus would be confined to states that don’t vote Republican, so letting those people get sick and die was smart politics.
I wish I could say that this is too awful to be believed, but let’s recall that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell clearly stated that he didn’t want to enact a “blue-state bailout” to ease the economic pain of states hit hard by the coronavirus. So this line of thinking wasn’t confined to the White House.
Obviously, these people have since gotten schooled as to the reality that the virus isn’t confined to blue states or big cities, and it’s now hitting their own voters hard. Indeed, as the Washington Post reported, that’s what persuaded Trump to start talking about the crisis again after many weeks of pretending it wasn’t happening.
But Trump’s commentary about the pandemic is making things worse, as always. He erroneously insists that kids are immune, that most of the country is doing great and that a vaccine will be available any day now. (In an extremely optimistic projection, there could be a vaccine in place by January, although there’s no guarantee it will be universally available or effective.) The testing system the Trumpers thought wouldn’t hurt “their people” is once again failing miserably as people have to wait for weeks to get results, and the nationwide surge is so widespread that contact tracing is almost useless anyway. Most of this is happening in red states that followed Trump over the cliff like a bunch of lemmings back in the spring when he told them the virus was going away and it was safe to reopen damn near everything.
Trump and Kushner could have come out of this looking like heroes — which would obviously have benefited the president’s odds of re-election — but they decided to play vindictive, divisive politics instead. But who knows? Maybe Trump will get lucky and that miracle cure will arrive any day. Maybe, as he’s been saying from the beginning, this virus will just disappear overnight. That’s really all there is to Trumpian politics at this point: punishing their enemies and magical thinking.

0,2020-07-31T17:32:17+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-the-key-to-a-real-democratic-landslide-in-november/,Here’s the key to a real Democratic landslide in November,"Within a week of the 2016 election, I began warning the Democrats against writing off small towns and rural areas in favor of a purely urban and suburban strategy. The Democrats didn’t listen and wound up being rewarded in the 2018 midterms when Trump’s style and policies caused his suburban support to crater more than his rural support could ever hope to rise.
If we were to rerun the 2016 election, Trump would still dominate in his areas of strength, but he’d lose badly. Of course, we can’t rerun the last election. This time, Trump is the incumbent and he’s very well-funded. His new opponent attracts and excites a different profile of the electorate than his old one. And we now have four years of Trump’s performance to weigh, which will have more impact than any other factor.
Yet, it remains the case that Trump’s rural strength gives him a chance to win in some states where he ought to lose. Ron Brownstein explains that the Democrats are in a decent position to make major gains in state legislative races, which is particularly important in this cycle, just as it was in 2010, because all the federal congressional districts will be redrawn with new census data before the 2022 midterms. But the Democrats hope to achieve this by pursuing their suburban advantage:
Even if Trump holds states such as Georgia, Texas, and Arizona by maximizing his rural performance, Democrats could still get a huge boost in down-ballot races if Biden routs the president in the growing urban and suburban areas. Biden’s performance in big metros is “the whole ball game,” Vicky Hausman, the founder and co-CEO of Forward Majority, a Democratic group that tries to flip state chambers, told me. “Trump can run up the score in the rural areas, and it doesn’t impact our path to the majority through the suburbs.”
It’s not true Trump’s rural performance will have no impact in legislative races. There are still some Democrats serving in rural districts, and many contested seats are a mix of suburban and exurban. But the easiest pickings for Democrats are purely suburban seats, and the most likely path to winning mixed seats is to run up their margins in the suburban portion of the districts. Therefore, the strategy makes sense if the goal is to win control of state legislative chambers.
Yet, it would be a shame for Joe Biden to lose states like Georgia, Texas, and Arizona because he came out on the wrong end of a rural/suburban polarization. Admittedly, this would represent a shift from 2016, when this polarization cost Clinton Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the presidency. Biden probably doesn’t need Texas and Georgia to win, and he probably doesn’t need Arizona either. However, if the election were to shift back in Trump’s direction, the same states that won the president the election in 2016 could come back into play.
So, there would be a lot of benefit if Biden could make some rural inroads. Not only would he secure the states he must win, but he’d start hauling in key states that Republicans must win. And, yes, this would increase the number of state legislative seats the Democrats carry, possibly allowing them to have more say in how new congressional seats are set up for the next decade. It would help them win U.S. Senate races not only in Texas, Georgia, and Arizona, but also in Alaska, Montana, Kansas, and Iowa.
I’m of the opinion that a narrow Biden win will be a tremendous relief to everyone, but that only a sweeping national condemnation of Trumpism and the Republican Party can put us on the right course. We need the Republicans and their financiers to get the message that their brand of politics is no longer viable or worth pursuing. We have to get past an equally divided and hopelessly polarized nation, and the Democrats need enough power to tackle the major challenges we face.
Therefore, the Democrats should be wary about pursuing a strategy based solely on the ripest fruit. A geographically split country is going to remain a politically divided country. A Democratic Texas would put a swift end to that state of affairs, but winning in places like Georgia and Kansas would also get us a long way toward that goal.
Everything Trump is doing is in the service of maximizing this division because he knows he needs overwhelming rural support, but the Democrats have many good arguments to take to these areas of the country, from the impact of Trump’s trade wars to his handling of the coronavirus and rural healthcare.
Biden should be ambitious and resist running a campaign premised on winning the rural/suburban split that Clinton lost.

0,2020-07-31T17:21:53+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/a-writer-details-the-striking-parallels-between-herman-cain-and-trumps-political-personas/,A writer details the striking parallels between Herman Cain and Trump’s political personas,"Herman Cain, the former Godfather’s Pizza CEO and Republican who served as co-chairman of Black Voices for Trump, died of complications from COVID-19 this week at the age of 74. Journalist Charles Bethea looks back on Cain’s political influence in an article for The New Yorker, arguing that he helped pave the way for Donald Trump’s presidency.
Politically, Cain was far-right, and the Tea Party ally ran to the right of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the 2012 GOP presidential primary. Ultimately, Romney won the nomination but lost to incumbent President Barack Obama in the general election.
Ironically, Cain was an African-American who embraced the racist birther movement, which claimed that Obama wasn’t really born in the United States. In 2011, Cain said of Obama: “He should prove he was born in the United States of America.” But Cain also attacked Obama for, as he saw it, not being Black enough.
Bethea explains: “Cain was an anomaly nine years ago: a black Republican with a loose grip on policy and an unorthodox campaign style, plus a fondness for referring to himself in the third person and an occasionally shocking portfolio of positions. He proposed a 20-foot, barbed-wire, electric fence on the border between the United States and Mexico; he’d said that he wouldn’t appoint a Muslim to his cabinet; he’d falsely claimed President Obama was raised in Kenya while implying that Obama wasn’t a ‘real black man.’”
After launching his presidential campaign in 2011, Bethea recalls, Cain declared, “I am a businessman problem-solver, not a politician” — which was very much the type of thing Trump said on the campaign trail four years ago.

— Herman Cain (@THEHermanCain) June 20, 2020

For his article, Bethea interviewed Mark Block, who served as chief of staff for Cain’s 2012 campaign — and Block agreed that Cain helped paved the way for Trump’s presidency.
Block told Bethea, “I’ve had dozens, if not hundreds, of people saying that what we did with Mr. Cain’s presidential campaign laid the groundwork for Trump, and I really do believe that…. We used to always say, ‘Let Cain be Cain.’ The Trump campaign did the same thing and still does.”

0,2020-07-31T16:53:29+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-senate-just-pushed-the-country-off-a-cliff-and-then-headed-for-the-hills/,The Senate just pushed the country off a cliff — and then headed for the hills,"Despite the pandemic-induced recession, millions of jobless Americans have been kept afloat by an uncharacteristically generous act of Congress. In addition to their state’s usual unemployment payments — usually a fraction of their previous wages — Americans have been eligible to receive and additional $600 a week, desperately needed support for people who saw their incomes crater.
But Republicans have been outraged that the payments were so generous, so they objected to legislation the Democrats passed in May to extend the program. They proposed a number of different ideas to extend the program on a more limited basis, but all these ideas came at the last minute and the GOP caucus couldn’t agree on a single plan. So on Friday, the program officially expires — meaning unemployed Americans who had been receiving a boost of $2,400 a month from the government will suddenly see those payments slashed to zero.
And now, the Senate has gone home for a long weekend.
Politico reported:
The Senate left town knowing that failed negotiations would ensure the expiration of enhanced jobless benefits for millions of Americans laid off and furloughed amid the coronavirus pandemic. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer met late into the night Thursday with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, hoping to break the impasse. But they got nowhere and emerged with acrimony and finger-pointing.
Per our colleagues at Playbook: “Meadows made an offer to extend enhanced unemployment at $600 per week for four months as a stand-alone bill. This is a new offer from the White House, and further than Republicans have gone thus far. It’s an extension of current law — something the GOP has railed against. Pelosi and Schumer rejected the offer, and countered with extending enhanced unemployment insurance at the same rate — $600 per week — through the first quarter of 2021.”
All of this was foreseeable, of course. When the CARES Act, which included the bonus unemployment payments, was first passed, it was set to expire at the end of July. Yet Congress — mostly through the GOP’s inaction, and because of the White House’s notable lack of leadership — let the country go off a cliff.
In fact, it had probably already gone off the cliff last week. As the Washington Post’s Jeff Stein has reported, for technical administrative reasons, Congress would have had to pass an extension of the program much earlier in order to avoid a gap in the payments:
Oh, and at the same time as the benefits are running out, Congress’s eviction moratorium on federal housing has expired, meaning people struggling to make ends meet could be vulnerable to being kicked out of their homes.
And it’s not just the individual families who suddenly see the checks dry up that will feel the pain. Inflicting this level of suffering on unemployed people will be devastating for the economy as a whole, as the New York Times Editorial Board explained:
Even with the infusion of trillions of dollars in federal aid since March, many Americans are struggling to ride out the crisis. Almost 40 million people do not expect to be able to make their next rent or mortgage payment. Almost 30 million Americans said they did not have enough to eat during the week ending July 21. Last week, for the 19th straight week, more than a million people filed fresh claims for unemployment benefits.
Grim as those numbers may be, the United States is on the verge of an even deeper crisis.
Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI, a financial research firm, estimates that failing to resume the federal unemployment payments would cause a drop in consumer spending large enough to eliminate about 1.7 million jobs — roughly the magnitude of job losses during the recessions of the early 1990s and the early 2000s.
Other crucial issues, such as providing support to state and local governments that have seen their revenues plummet, also remain unresolved because the GOP refuses to address them.
The greatest mystery of all this is the Republicans’ motivations. From all appearances, this is electoral suicide. Control of the White House and the Senate are on the ballot in November, and the GOP’s prospects look grim regardless of the actions Congress takes. How much worse could it get if they force millions into financial distress and allow the economy to slide furth into a historic slump?
It’s shortsighted and needlessly cruel. But we’ve come to expect nothing else from the conservative elites.

0,2020-07-31T16:00:11+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-how-trumps-racist-outreach-to-white-suburban-voters-could-backfire-big-time/,Here’s how Trump’s racist outreach to white suburban voters could backfire big time,"In the hope of winning more votes in suburban areas, President Donald Trump has posted a series of overtly racist tweets vowing to fight “low-income housing” in the suburbs and claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden, if elected, will destroy the quality of life in suburbia. Journalist Eric Levitz analyzes Trump’s suburban outreach in an article published in New York Magazine on July 31, arguing that Trump’s overt racism could have an unintended consequence: making suburbia even more racially diverse.
“For decades now, college-educated white suburbanites have been drifting leftward,” Levitz explains. “And the white professional class’s realignment has only accelerated during Donald Trump’s time in the national spotlight. In recent polls, Joe Biden’s margin over the president among college-educated white voters is nearly twice as high as Hillary Clinton’s was four years ago. And as the New York Times illustrates, Trump’s already low support among suburban-dwelling Americans of all colors has dwindled since 2016.”
Suburbia, Levitz notes, is already full of whites who are posting Black Lives Matters signs, and he argues that suburbia might end up with even more of those signs if Trump continues to say overtly racist things to suburban voters.
Levitz acknowledges that suburbia has its share of white “NIMBY liberals” — that is, whites who will claim to support diversity only to say “not in my back yard” behind closed doors. But overt, in-your-face racism, Levitz argues, is not the way to win them over. Overt racism, according to Levitz, “has no appeal to this voting bloc. NIMBY liberals want racially exclusionary zoning policies wrapped up in rhetoric about historical preservation, not Trump’s garish branding.”
“Affluent white liberals are more apt to put ideology above privilege on national issues than on those that hit closer to home,” Levitz observes. “But even before Trump’s intervention into the NIMBY debate, the movement for inclusive zoning was already gathering momentum.”
One thing that Levitz’ article doesn’t get into but is quite relevant to a discussion of race and suburbia is gentrification, which has been chasing many African-American families out of urban areas that they were a part of for generations. When New York City’s Harlem or areas of Brooklyn, South Philly or West Philly become increasingly unaffordable, one of the results is more African-Americans moving to suburbia. Blacks who can no longer afford West Philly have been moving to Delaware County or Montgomery County in the Philly suburbs; blacks who used to live within 125th Street and Lenox Avenue/Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem have moved to North Jersey.
The term “inner-city” was used to describe African-American areas in the 1970s and 1980s; in 2020, many working class African-Americans are finding suburban areas to be more affordable. The Rev. Al Sharpton, during a recent appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” stressed that in light of the effects of gentrification, Trump’s comments on suburbia are not only racist — they are also painfully dated.
Levitz writes, “The president’s remarks are unlikely to change the hearts of the minority of suburban liberals who attend zoning meetings to actively oppose affordable housing developments. But they could serve to nudge more passive supporters of discriminatory housing policy toward a ‘come to density’ moment.”

Kushner, according to Vanity Fair’s Katherine Eban, launched a coronavirus testing plan back in the spring. But as a July 30 article by Eban explains, things did not go well at all.
During a three-month period, Eban notes, “more than 2.4 million Americans contracted COVID-19, and 123,331 of them died of the illness — first in New York, and then in states around the country. Governors, public health experts and frightened citizens sounded the alarm that a critical shortage of tests and the ballooning time to get results were crippling the U.S. pandemic response. But the million tests, some of which were distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to several states, were of no help. According to documents obtained by Vanity Fair, they were examined in two separate government laboratories and found to be ‘contaminated and unusable.’”
Vanity Fair, Eban reports, has obtained a copy of an invoice from the company Cogna Technology Solutions that “noted a total order of 3.5 million tests for an amount owed of $52 million.”
“The tests’ mysterious provenance would spark confusion and finger-pointing,” Eban notes. “An Abu Dhabi–based artificial intelligence company, Group 42, with close ties to the UAE’s ruling family, identified itself as the seller of 3.5 million tests and demanded payment. Its requests were routed through various divisions within Health and Human Services, whose lawyers sought in vain for a bona fide contracting officer.”
Kushner, according to Eban, “oversaw a secret project to devise a comprehensive plan that would have massively ramped up and coordinated testing for COVID-19 at the federal level.” But a participant, quoted anonymously, told Vanity Fair that the plan “just went poof into thin air.”Trump has been claiming that the U.S. has the most comprehensive, efficient and widely available coronavirus testing program in the world. But that claim is wildly inaccurate: during the recent coronavirus surge, there have been numerous reports of people waiting much too long for their test results.
In the U.S., Eban observes, “Cable news and front pages have been dominated by images of miles-long lines of cars in scorching Arizona and Texas heat, their drivers waiting hours for scarce diagnostic tests, and desperate Sun Belt mayors pleading in vain for federal help to expand testing capacity.”

Trump, however, has a history of voting by mail. And an “Access Hollywood” video from 2004 shows Trump threatening to vote by mail after struggling with voting machines.
CNN’s Paul LeBlanc explains that the “Access Hollywood” segment “shows Trump alongside TV host Billy Bush visiting multiple New York City polling locations. Trump, however, is blocked from voting at each location because he is not on any of the voter rolls at each stop.”
Trump, according to LeBlanc, becomes “increasingly frustrated” and says, “I’m going to fill out the absentee ballot.”
When the segment ends, Trump is seen filling out a provisional ballot in his car and says, “I just voted. At least you can say the Trumpster doesn’t give up.”

But when Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on July 31, he stressed that Trump is talking nonsense because mail-in voting and absentee voting are the same thing.
Steele told “Morning Joe” hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, “Mail-in balloting, mail-in voting is legitimate. It is done in at least five states. Every state has some form of it. You know it as absentee balloting. Yesterday, the president was like, ‘I love absentee balloting, but this vote by mail thing’ — Mr. President, they’re the same thing, OK? Just so you understand, an absentee ballot is the same as a mail-in ballot.”
Trump came under fire on July 30 for posting a tweet in which he floated the possibility of delaying the presidential election in order to avoid voter fraud. But Steele, like other Never Trump conservatives, has vehemently rejected Trump’s suggestion.
The former RNC chairman stressed, “Just so we’re clear, America: absentee ballot, vote by mail — same thing.”

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, Democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report. I’m Amy Goodman.
The U.S. coronavirus death toll has topped 150,000 on Wednesday, the highest of any nation by far. The hardest hit states per capita are Florida, Louisiana, Arizona, Mississippi, Alabama, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Idaho, Tennessee and Georgia, a list that includes all seven of the original Confederate states.
Today we talk about COVID and so much more as we spend the hour with Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author, Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught for more than 50 years, now laureate professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona. Author of more than 100 books. Professor Chomsky spoke with Democracy Now!’s Nermeen Shaikh and I on Thursday, from his home in Tucson, Arizona about the coronavirus crisis.
NOAM CHOMSKY We should understand the roots of this pandemic. If we do not understand the roots and extirpate them, there is going to be another and worse one coming. So far we have been kind of lucky. The coronavirus, pandemics, epidemics are very serious, and there are many possibilities. So far, all the ones that have happened in the last ten or 15 years, either the virus has been very deadly but not very contagious, like Ebola, or very contagious but not very deadly, like COVID-19. What happens when the next one comes along that is both very contagious and very deadly? We are in deep trouble. Deep. Much worse than this. Much worse than the so-called “Spanish flu,” which ought to be called the Kansas flu by Trump’s logic. It originated in Kansas the century ago. We may be facing something much worse than that.
There are ways of dealing with it. After the SARS epidemic in 2003, scientists knew that another one is very likely. They warned against it. They presented policies that could be carried out. They weren’t implemented, in part because of deep institutional pathologies. The drug companies who are the obvious candidates for dealing with it can’t, by straight capitalist logic. You don’t spend money to try to prevent a catastrophe ten years from now. What you do is try to make money tomorrow. That is the logic of the system. So the pharmaceutical companies were ruled out by capitalist logic.
The government could step in. The government, in any event, does most of the basic research for vaccines and drugs, almost all of them. So they could have stepped in, create laboratories, and plenty of unlimited resources. But they are blocked by the neoliberal plague. Remember Ronald Reagan—that government is the problem, not the solution, which means we have to take decision-making and action out of the hands of government, which has a flaw; it’s somewhat responsive to the population. We have to shift it to unaccountable, private tyrannies, which are totally unaccountable to the population. That is the meaning of Reagan’s slogan. That is the fundamental principle of neoliberalism. We’ve been suffering—the world has been suffering from it for 40 years, except for the tiny percentage who have become super rich and extremely powerful. Well, that blocks the government.
Nevertheless, there were things that the government could do. When the Obama administration took office, in the first few days, Obama called the presidential scientific advisory board, which had been established by George H.W. Bush, the first Bush, who had some respect for science. Obama called it. He requested that they put together a pandemic reaction program, a way to deal with a pandemic if it comes. They came up with a report a couple weeks later. It was implemented. It was in place until January 2017.
Trump came into office, the first few days, dismantled the whole system. Nothing. That’s part of the general wrecking ball. “We have to destroy everything that Obama did. We have to wreck everything.” Because it is the only way to look like you are doing something. Happening all over. So that went.
There were programs of U.S. scientists working in China with Chinese colleagues to try to detect and identify coronaviruses. Most of them are deep in caves. It’s very dangerous work. Some have been killed, Chinese scientists. But they were finding them and identifying them and testing them. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is the main center for investigating this. Trump canceled the program.
There were simulations run of a pandemic as late as October 2019 warning of what would happen. No attention. The Trump administration isn’t interested. So when the epidemic finally hit, the United States was singularly unprepared. After that comes a series of grotesque inactions and actions. For a couple of months, Trump refused to admit that it was happening.
Other countries were doing things. In Asia, Oceania, Australia, New Zealand, they were reacting. Some of it, South Korea, which was one of the first places hit, never had to go to a lockdown because they dealt with it rationally. They identified the places that were hot spots, controlled them, tested, traced people for contacts. Countries pretty much functioned. Vietnam has reported zero deaths, and apparently that is taken quite seriously by leading U.S. specialists. The Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, which monitors the international situation, records zero deaths from Vietnam, which has a 1,400-mile border with China. South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia are doing quite well. And Europe, they delayed in quite a way, but they did finally act. As you mentioned, the curve has sharply reduced since March for most of Europe. Some of them, like Norway, Germany, doing quite well in this respect. People are traveling through southern Italy almost like normal.
It has gotten so extreme that, as you know, Europe has banned American visitors. The United States is such a pariah state that Americans are not permitted to go to other countries. Other countries won’t allow them in. This is kind of mimicked in a horrible way in Brazil. Bolsonaro just denies that it’s happening. “It’s just a mild flu. Don’t worry about it. Brazilians are strong. We don’t care.” So big meetings of right-wing Bolsonaro supporters dancing in the streets and spreading the virus, and Bolsonaro says fine.
And one of the really world-shaking crimes that is being carried out is the destruction of the Amazon. That affects the whole world, not just Brazil. It’s basically genocide to the indigenous populations. Scientific predictions are that on our current course, the Amazon will shift in about 15 years from being a net sink of carbon dioxide to a net emitter of carbon dioxide, sometimes called the lungs of the Earth. The forest absorbs huge amounts of carbon dioxide. It will start emitting them instead. A little further down the road, the Amazon, under the current course, will just turn into savanna, no forest anymore. Devastating for Brazil and the other Amazonian countries. Devastating for the world. It’s one of the main oxygen producers of the world.
At every level, we are racing madly towards total catastrophe under the leadership of sociopathic fanatics. It is as if some evil demon decided to take over the human species and drive them to self-destruction. Much of the world is trying to counter it, almost all of the world, but the United States and Brazil are the extreme cases of racing with dedication towards disaster.
Going back to this election, that is the reason why it is the most dangerous, the most significant election in history. Why Trump is, in fact—this may sound outrageous, but it’s true—Trump is the most dangerous figure in human history. The Republican Party today is the most dangerous organization in human history. You can compare Trump to, say, Hitler, the Wannsee declaration in 1942, called for killing all the Jews, tens of millions of Slavs, not destroying humanized society. There has been nothing like this. Nothing.
The Republican Party, we know how they shifted. You go back just a decade or so, John McCain, 2008, was running for president. His program had some pretty weak, but some policies directed to global warming. The Republican Congress was beginning to contemplate global warming, policies to restrict global warming. The Koch brothers, a superrich energy corporation, got wind of this. They had been working for years to prevent it. David Koch, one of the Koch brothers who died recently, launched an incredible campaign to make sure that the Republican Party would turn to denialism. They bribed senators, intimidated others with the threat of running counter-campaigns against them. Huge lobbying campaign. Astroturf campaigns. A massive juggernaut. The party shifted, dropped all of its efforts to deal with climate change. It’s now a party led by denialists.
AMY GOODMAN: As you talk about this denialism and the science denialism, first dealing with the climate crisis and then extending to the pandemic, both threatening life on Earth, with President Trump now holding a daily coronavirus press briefing without the scientists, you have Anthony Fauci throwing out the first ball at the Washington Nationals game, the chief infectious disease scientist, who won’t play ball exactly with the White House, so he is not in the coronavirus briefing. You have Dr. Birx. President Trump says she’s right outside, but she is not a part of this news conference. Do you think reporters who are sitting in the White House briefing room should refuse to be there unless scientists are there and unless President Trump wears a mask?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Yes, I think so, and I think they should do much more. They should be pointing out constantly what I just said: we’re dealing with the most dangerous figure in human history, backed by the most dangerous organization in human history, and give the facts. Not only the pandemic, but the much more serious threat of environmental disaster and the growing, very severe threat of nuclear war.
In my opinion, every newspaper should have on the front page an image of the Doomsday Clock. You know all about this, but every January, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists gathers—the main scientific journal dealing with these issues—gathers scientists, political analysts to try to give an estimate of the security, the state of the world security. Started shortly after the atom bomb, it has been going on for 75 years. The minute hand is moved closer or farther—it oscillates—closer or farther to midnight, depending how dangerous the world situation is. Midnight means we are finished.
Every year that Trump has been in office, the minute hand has moved closer to midnight. Two years ago, it reached the closest it had ever been. This last January, the analysts gave up minutes; they moved to seconds. A hundred seconds to midnight. Since January, Trump has made every one of the issues that they have brought up worse. There were three major issues. One is of course the threat of nuclear war, second the threat of environmental catastrophe, the third the deterioration of democracy. Which does belong, because it is only with a vibrant democracy of informed, engaged public that we can have any hope of escaping from the two existential crises.
Since January, Trump has succeeded in making all three crises worse. I mention the nuclear weapons issue, considerably worse thanks to Trump’s actions. The environmental crisis of course getting worse, as he continues to press for maximization of the use of the most dangerous fossil fuels, cuts back through his EPA representatives and others, cuts back on the efforts to mitigate the crisis through regulatory means. And democracy, it’s pretty obvious; the executive branch has been essentially cleansed of independent voices. Nothing but sycophants of Pompeo variety. “We were sent by God to save Israel.”
The Inspectors General who were imposed by Congress, by the Republican Congress to monitor malfeasance of the executive branches, purged. Trump in fact went out of his way to humiliate the senior Republican senator, Charles Grassley, who had spent much of his career imposing these monitors. The attorney for the Southern District of New York looked into the Trump swamp; fired. Congress, turned by McConnell, used to be called the greatest deliberative body in the world. Now it is a joke. Doesn’t do any deliberation. It does essentially nothing except try to race through as many appointments of young, ultra-right judges as possible so they can pack the judiciary for a generation. The only other thing it does is figure out ways to pour money into the—dollars into the pockets of the rich, like the tax scam. That’s the Senate, the greatest deliberative body. Proposals come from the House for legislation; McConnell just cans them. Don’t look at them. That is not the role of the Senate.
Going back, that’s why they should be putting the Doomsday Clock on the front of every newspaper. Show us what the United States is doing to the world. To itself and the world. That should be in front of everyone’s attention. And there are many other things that should be done. There should be major protests now, everywhere, against the use of military force to occupy American cities and to crush peaceful dissidents. This is intolerable in a functioning democracy.

When she found the group, still with their symbol of hate hanging proudly behind them, it turned into a roughly 10-minute standoff that’s gotten more than 143,000 views on Facebook within a day. Because Smith-Rayfield was not backing down.
“That flag right there is my swastika. You put it up on this beach, yes, I’m going to come out every single freakin’ time to tell you they lost the damn war. This is the United States of America, not the Confederacy of America,” she said. While the group did take down their towel so it wasn’t hanging out for all to see, they weren’t apologizing or acknowledging the racist damage they had done, and she wasn’t letting them off the hook for it as long as what they were doing meant “I can’t feel comfortable in my own neighborhood.”
Early on, as she challenged the white group about their symbol of hate, a man who appeared to be a person of color took their side, saying he had served in the military “to defend this flag.”
“No you didn’t, you fought to defend a flag that had 50 stars on it,” Smith-Rayfield shot back.
“I’m not going to argue with a man of color about that flag, it’s stupid,” she said, as the man continued heatedly defending the right of white people to display the Confederate flag. When he said that she, not the racists, was the one bothering people, Smith-Rayfield said of the Confederate flag: “It should bother everyone on this damn beach.”
“That right there is a racist symbol of hate. My question to you is, how does that flag hold any relevance to you today in this country today? You vote in elections that have 50 stars on the flag. What does that flag have to do with today? If you aren’t a racist, then why are you holding that flag up?”
At one point, Smith-Rayfield even offered to buy the towel from the group, proffering $20 and suggesting that if it was really just a towel to them, not a symbol, that was a good deal for them. They didn’t take it. Because quite obviously it was not just a towel for them. These people wanted attention, which is also why they had one and only one of their towels hanging on the fence. One of the racists at one point accused Smith-Rayfield of wanting attention, but they were very clearly out there trying to draw attention to hate.
Before Smith-Rayfield arrived at the beach, Evanston Mayor Steve Hagerty had seen reports of the flag being displayed, had gone and looked and, not seeing it, had declared the reports fake news. Later, he acknowledged that it had in fact been displayed but said a beach supervisor asked them to take the flag down. After Smith-Rayfield’s video spread, he apologized and described it as “a great example of confronting hate,” adding: “Her courage and persistence is admirable and an example for all of us.”
Also after Smith-Rayfield left the beach, a group of protesters arrived with Black Lives Matter signs and stayed until the racists left. A rally against racism is planned for July 31 at 2 PM ET on Lighthouse Beach in Evanston, Illinois.
But this video is simultaneously wonderful as an example of courage and awful because you can absolutely hear the toll the encounter takes on Smith-Rayfield, a teacher and mother of four and, for me, a high school friend. She stands strong, but her voice cracks. She struggles not to scream or swear or do anything that would make her the unreasonable person in the encounter—something she’s been accused of in hateful comments nonetheless. And what you don’t see until the end of the video is that she was accompanied by her teenage children.
This kind of fortitude should not be required of people to assert their basic humanity and right to enjoy their neighborhood beach without being confronted by symbols of the enslavement of their ancestors. This kind of composure should not be necessary in the face of indolent, smug bigotry like those white beachgoers displayed. And, as she said when a white onlooker apologized to her as she left, “I don’t need apologies, I need action.”
No one was physically injured. No one was arrested for the crime of Blackness. But this act of racism still hurt people.

0,2020-07-31T11:59:39+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/has-trump-finally-crossed-the-line-with-congressional-republicans/,Has Trump finally crossed the line with Congressional Republicans?,"When it comes to the November election, Donald Trump is losing and he knows it. That’s why he’s swinging for the rafters—trying to find something that will change or delay the inevitable. As Tony Schwartz said, Trump treats “every encounter as a contest he had to win, because the only other option from his perspective was to lose, and that was the equivalent of obliteration.” To avoid obliteration, the president will do or say anything.
That was made evident when he tweeted this on Thursday morning.
The president has already spread lies about how using mail-in ballots are an attempt to rig the election and refused to say that he will abide by the outcome. But this is the first time he’s publicly broached the idea of delaying the election.
Trump sent that tweet on the same day that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was scheduled to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the State Department budget. Senator Kaine used some of his time to question Pompeo about the fact that the president just floated the idea of delaying the election.
The guy who graduated from Harvard Law School suggested that the Department of Justice would make a legal determination on the question of whether the president can delay the election. Surely he knows what the Constitution says about that.
Article II of the Constitution empowers Congress to determine the timing of the election. An 1845 federal law fixed the date as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
“Only Congress can change the date of our elections, and under no circumstances will we consider doing so to accommodate the president’s inept and haphazard response to the coronavirus pandemic,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California and the chair of the Administration Committee, which oversees elections.
Some Republicans responded to Trump’s tweet by saying it was a joke.
Others made it clear that a delay is not going to happen.
“Never in the history of the federal elections have we not held an election, and we should go forward,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader…
“Never in the history of the country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we’ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3,” Mr. McConnell said…
“We’re going to have an election, it’s going to be legitimate, it’s going to be credible, it’s going to be the same as it’s always been,” Mr. Rubio told reporters at the Capitol in Washington.
Mr. Cruz agreed. “I think election fraud is a serious problem,” he said. “But, no, we should not delay the election.”
Whether or not the president got the message from his own party’s leaders remains to be seen. He seemed to double down on the idea of delaying the election by pinning his tweet to the top of his Twitter page. So keep an eye on this one. Either Trump and his minions back down, or we might have finally reached the point where the president’s enablers are willing to draw the line.
One additional note: the pushback is not just coming from the president’s congressional enablers. Take a look at what the founder of the Federalist Society, Steven Calabrisi, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times.
I have voted Republican in every presidential election since 1980, including voting for Donald Trump in 2016. I wrote op-eds and a law review article protesting what I believe was an unconstitutional investigation by Robert Mueller. I also wrote an op-ed opposing President Trump’s impeachment.
But I am frankly appalled by the president’s recent tweet seeking to postpone the November election. Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate…
President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election. Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent in American history. Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress again.
Better late than never, I guess.

0,2020-07-31T11:49:06+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/bill-barr-has-done-this-before/,Bill Barr has done this before,"As violent crime continued to climb in Chicago and other cities across the country, Attorney General William P. Barr announced that the U.S. Department of Justice was mobilizing to help: Dozens of federal agents would be sent to work with local police to combat gangs and illegal guns.
“Our message to gangs, gang leaders and gang members is this: When we throw the federal book at you, it will be a knockout blow,” Barr said.
That was in 1992, during Barr’s first stint leading the Justice Department, under former President George H.W. Bush.
If it sounds too recent or familiar to have happened nearly three decades ago, that’s because Barr, now attorney general under President Donald Trump, made a strikingly similar announcement on July 22.
Some of the details were different, of course. In 1992, Barr said the FBI was shifting about 300 agents from monitoring spies from the recently collapsed Soviet Union to taking on gangs and violent crime in American cities. Eighteen of the agents would be redeployed to Chicago.
This month, Barr stood next to Trump as he announced a Chicago “surge” of more than 100 agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and other agencies, along with staffing increases in other cities where gun casualties were making headlines.
Residents of Chicago could be forgiven for concluding that they’ve heard this before, since, of course, they essentially have. Barr even acknowledged that federal law enforcement agencies have carried out such operations “for decades.” Every presidential administration in the last 30 years has announced it was sending more federal agents to Chicago to try to stem violent crime.
But this time the circumstances are different — the politics are shifting. After 3 ½ years of Trump’s inflammatory comments and tweets, some thinly coded and others overtly racist, his administration’s announcement is widely seen in Chicago as a political move to use the troubles of a majority-nonwhite city to fire up his supporters.
And it’s happening as a growing number of people are demanding that their governments send something into their communities other than more guys with guns.
Chicago has a long, ugly history of violence. As in other cities, violent crime surged in Chicago in the 1960s and ’70s, dropped and leveled off, then spiked again during the 1990s. But since then, as murder and shooting totals plummeted in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, Chicago’s numbers didn’t fall as far or as fast, and they’ve climbed again during several devastating stretches in the last 10 years.
The reasons have long been debated and are probably more complex than most would acknowledge. But politicians, law enforcement leaders and many residents have repeatedly blamed Chicago’s gang culture and open-air drug markets, then called for policing strategies to attack them.
The fact that most of the hardest-hit neighborhoods have also been shelled out by segregation, business closures and job losses — including thousands of layoffs from government agencies and shuttered schools — is well known. Yet the need for immediate responses to the bloodshed, rather than those that tackle the deeper problems, always seems to consume political and financial capital in Chicago.
In 1992, the city banned loitering by people deemed to be gang members until the measure was ruled unconstitutional. Former Mayor Richard M. Daley led an effort to sue gun manufacturers for creating a public nuisance in Chicago and other cities; the case was tossed out of court. Speed bumps and cul-de-sacs were built on dozens of side streets to thwart drive-by shootings, though as police and paramedics discovered, such obstacles also made it harder for them to respond to emergencies.
Far more common have been announcements that more police will be deployed in high-crime areas, often under the banner of a new task force, program or initiative. That’s where the feds often come in — literally.
Soon after Trump took office in 2017, he called Chicago a “war zone” and blamed local leaders for being “politically correct.” He also threatened, via Twitter, “I will send in the Feds!”
Rahm Emanuel, then Chicago’s mayor and a frequent Trump sparring partner, rejected the idea of troops in the city. “I’m against it, straight up,” he told reporters. But Emanuel added that he welcomed additional resources to fight gun crimes. Within two weeks, CNN reported that 20 more ATF agents were being sent to Chicago.
Since Lori Lightfoot was elected mayor last year, she has repeatedly blasted Trump for racism and disrespect for civil rights — even as she’s been attacked in Chicago for not yet delivering on promises to reform the Police Department and drive up investment in underserved neighborhoods.
On July 20, after another weekend of appalling violence in Chicago — dozens of people were reportedly wounded in shootings and at least 12 people killed — Trump suggested at a press conference that he was again ready to send in federal agents. Lightfoot responded with a letter that criticized his administration’s “incendiary rhetoric” as well as the tactics of Department of Homeland Security agents who had seized people off the street in Portland, Oregon.
Yet Lightfoot also said the city could use other kinds of federal help, including “more federal prosecution or investigatory resources” to pursue violent crime and gun cases. She added that the government could help Chicago invest in underserved neighborhoods. “The violence our city is confronting is symptomatic of a larger public health and economic crisis.”
Trump and Barr announced the latest “surge” of federal agents to Chicago that week, describing it as part of a national crime-reduction initiative called Operation Legend. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security would together send dozens of investigators and agents to the city, with the U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch Jr., overseeing the operation.
Underneath the politics and symbolism, the announcement signaled that federal and local officials were returning to their old strategy: send in more cops.
Shifting federal agents to cities under fire is “commonly done, and as a matter of fact, when I was the special agent-in-charge there, I asked for it,” said Jack Riley, who formerly served as the top agent in the DEA’s Chicago office. “It’s been called 20 different things in the past. [Operation Legend] is just the newest version of it.”
This federal surge may involve more agents than previous efforts, and Riley believes it could help tamp down violence in Chicago if it is carefully coordinated and sustained. Operations on the street should be carried out by agents who know the city, with those from out of town used in support roles. And as agents are conducting investigations and making arrests, the U.S. attorney’s office needs enough staff to prosecute the increased caseload, said Riley, who went on to serve as the No. 2 official in the DEA, overseeing global operations, before retiring.
“Are there going to be additional prosecutors?” he said. “That’s been an issue before.”
The U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago received a staffing boost in 2018, but no additional prosecutors are included in the latest operation. A spokesman for the office declined to comment.
Plus, the agent surge is only likely to last until fall, when the city’s usual spike in violence typically recedes along with the warm weather. So, like previous efforts, the surge is temporary.
If those earlier short-term operations worked to reduce gun violence, it’s hard for city residents to see as shootings spike again.
Over the last three years, the U.S. attorney’s office here has prosecuted more than 500 defendants on weapons charges, records show. Some of the defendants are traffickers or leaders of other criminal enterprises. But many tend to be lower-level players caught with illegal guns that have traded hands multiple times. Law enforcement officials argue that prosecutions for illegal possession help deter others. Still, the approach hasn’t shut down the gun marketplace, as firearms continue to flow into the city from suburbs and neighboring states.
So far Operation Legend appears to be following the playbook of those earlier initiatives. The first three arrests made as part of the Chicago surge were all for illegal gun possession, according to court filings.
On July 23, the day after the latest federal deployments were announced, Black Lives Matter Chicago and 10 other organizations sued Barr and other administration officials. The groups, seeing no reason to trust the Trump administration, asked for a federal court order to protect their right to protest in the event of any Portland-style tactics. In addition, they made what amounted to a defund-the-federal-police argument, claiming federal resources would be better spent on investing in their communities than flooding them with more law enforcement officers.
“We should take their money and use it to help people facing eviction, use those resources for people who need access to food,” Amika Tendaji, an organizer with Black Lives Matter, said in an interview. “The police haven’t been able to do anything [about the violence]. We need to actually address the root causes.”
More and more leaders are signing on to this approach. Over the last week, advocacy groups, churches and more than 30 state and local elected officials added their names to a letter urging Lightfoot and Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart not to cooperate with the federal operation.
“Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated both his callous disregard for Black, indigenous, and immigrant lives, and his increasing inclination towards fascism and authoritarianism,” the letter said. “We grieve deeply the lives lost to gun violence in Chicago. … At the same time, we are clear that we cannot police ourselves out of this terrible situation.”
Chicago is now on a pace to record one of its highest annual murder totals in two decades. It’s hard to argue that the old strategies have worked."
0,2020-07-31T11:45:30+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trump-on-the-couch-author-bully-president-is-a-psychotic-who-hates-anyone-who-is-loved/,‘Trump on the Couch’ author: ‘Bully’ president is a ‘psychotic’ who hates anyone who is loved,"Donald Trump is a very obvious person. He is the equivalent of a character in a comic book with a huge thought bubble over his head that everyone can read. But Trump goes even further than that. Because he has no internal censor, Trump shares his private thoughts and impulses with the world without shame or fear of consequences.
Through his public behavior Trump has repeatedly shown that he is mentally unwell. His apparent pathologies include malignant narcissism, delusions of grandeur, an attraction to violence, sadism, a lack of impulse control, utter disregard for rules and norms, and a pathological tendency to lie. In sum, our president can be reasonably described as a psychopath or a sociopath.
The most recent examples of Trump’s mentally unwell behavior, among many include his obsession with his popularity and “ratings” when more than 150,000 Americans are dead from the coronavirus. His easily-injured sense of self is more important than showing any care or concern for the suffering of others. Because Trump is incapable of empathy, the lives of the American people mean nothing to him. Trump “cares” about his followers only as a source of narcissistic fuel.
During a “press conference” on Tuesday at the White House, Trump made a remarkable statement, saying right out loud, “Nobody likes me.”
It came in the context of Trump comparing himself to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease specialist. Here’s how this episode was reported by The Hill:
“It’s interesting. He’s got a very good approval rating, and I like that. It’s good,” Trump said during a press briefing at the White House. “Because, remember, he’s working for this administration. He’s working with us. We could’ve gotten other people. We could’ve gotten somebody else. It didn’t have to be Dr. Fauci. He’s working with our administration, and for the most part, we’ve done pretty much what he and others … recommended.”
“He’s got this high approval rating, so why don’t I have a high approval rating … with respect to the virus?” Trump wondered aloud. …
“It sort of is curious,” Trump said. “A man works for us, with us, very closely, Dr. Fauci and Dr. [Deborah] Birx, also highly thought of, and yet they’re highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That’s all.”
He may be the most powerful person in the world, but Trump possesses a deep sense of grievance, victimhood and vulnerability. Although his press conference was supposed to focus on the coronavirus pandemic, it was almost entirely devoted to feeding the president’s ego. Trump’s narcissism, again, showed itself to be more important than the safety of the American people.
Trump continues to tell obvious lies in an effort to twist reality to his will. Trump claimed he had been invited to throw out the first pitch at a New York Yankees game on Aug. 15. That was not true. He continues to claim that the drug hydroxychloroquine is a cure for COVID-19. That’s not true. Indeed, it’s a potentially lethal drug if not taken as directed and under the guidance of a medical professional.
For several years leading mental health professionals have tried to warn the public that Donald Trump’s mental health makes him a danger to the United States and the world. In cowardly fashion, senior Republican officials as well as members of Trump’s own administration have offered the same warnings in private.
Donald Trump’s niece, Dr. Mary Trump, a psychologist, is the first member of the president’s family to issue similar warnings. In her new best-selling book “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man,” Mary Trump reflects on her personal experiences in the Trump family and her belief that the president’s apparent mental illness can be traced back to abusive parenting, an intolerant household where racism and other forms of bigotry were common, and an overall environment of cruelty and lack of care or concern for other human beings.
Dr. Justin Frank is a former clinical professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University Medical Center and a physician with more than 40 years of experience in psychoanalysis. He is the author of the bestselling books “Bush on the Couch” and “Obama on the Couch.” His most recent book is “Trump on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the President.”
In our most recent conversation, Dr. Frank shares his thoughts about Mary Trump’s book and what it reveals about how Donald Trump’s relationship with both his father and mother led to his embrace of cruelty and lack of human warmth, and why Trump is incapable of “maturing” or “growing” as so many reporters and journalists have deluded themselves into believing he may.
Frank also warns the American people that Trump is a violent and emotionally abusive bully and that they will need to find the moral and personal courage to confront him. In order to do so, Americans will first need to confront their own shame and culpability for allowing Trump to become president in the first place.
You can also listen to my conversation with Dr. Justin Frank on my podcast “The Truth Report” or through the player embedded below.
This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.
This hasn’t been a good few weeks for Donald Trump, has it?
He has always had a split mind. It is split between two sides. This is called “binary thinking.” In this way of thinking a person is either right or wrong. You like me or you hate me. You’re loyal or you’re disloyal. Trump’s world is very clearly demarcated. Now he is likely upset by Fox News because of his interview with Chris Wallace. In his mind, Fox News is now a very difficult organization. How is he going to place them? Good or bad? Friend of foe? A person develops binary thinking as a way of protecting themselves from anxiety. Trump has made his world very simple. If anyone questions or challenges him they are “nasty” and must be retaliated against. That’s how his world is.
Every child feels that way until they’re five or six. Sometimes children do not engage in such simple thinking for long, it may stop at age two or three.
Donald Trump’s interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News was not difficult. Wallace asked easy questions. Trump simply fell flat on his face and embarrassed himself. But is Trump even capable of feeling embarrassed?
He is not. Trump is able to be shamed in the presence of someone else and that’s what happened to him with Obama at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2011. Obama really did humiliate Trump in public by making fun of him. It was very upsetting to Trump. I believe those feelings were converted in Trump’s mind from humiliation and shame immediately into aggressive hatred. This is a feature of Trump’s mind.
The problem with binary thinking is that unless you learn to think complex thoughts, you have a very limited range of responses to adversity or trouble. A person who thinks in that way either tries to run away from adversity or to kill it somehow. Over the years Donald Trump has compromised his ability to think critically. Trump can only react using a simple good-or-bad binary.
Trump has now returned to his daily “press briefings,” which are really just mini-rallies that can get him attention and narcissistic fuel. There are still too many reporters and journalists who praise Trump for “maturing” and treating the pandemic with more “seriousness.” It is laughable and pathetic. Donald Trump is mentally pathological and cannot change. Yet mainstream American journalists keep trying to normalize him.
Those people want Donald Trump to be normal because it is terrifying to have a president who is psychotic. People do not want to believe a president would commit genocide, attack Black and brown people, separate children from their mothers, and cheat and steal all the time. Trump is a man who is both criminal and dangerous. Most people, including the journalist class, cannot accept that reality because it is too frightening.
The American news media wants to normalize Trump for another reason, not only because they’re scared to stand up to a sadistic and disturbed and paranoid president, but because they are also guilt-ridden about trying to normalize him in the past. When a person tries to normalize an abnormal and dangerous person then guilt sets in. The news media keeps trying to normalize Trump, so they rush to praise any positive thing Trump does as a way of justifying their previous need to normalize him.
Donald Trump is America’s bully in chief. So many Americans are afraid to stand up to him. They likely have never confronted the bullies in their personal lives either.
They are afraid of him and he knows it. One of the things Donald Trump has done psychologically is that he projects his own fear and weaknesses on to the people he is bullying. Trump is capable of bullying people with great strength and force and that scares people. Likewise, Republican elected officials are afraid to stand up to Trump because they don’t want to get beaten up at the polls, believing Trump is so powerful. They want to keep their jobs.
Triumphing over Trumpism and repairing the country will require a new level of maturity for the American people. Part of that new maturity will require confronting bullies and getting over fear.  Many people are scared of Trump and his regime — as they should be — but they don’t know what to do about the situation, so they sink further into learned helplessness.
That is true on one level. But there is another dimension as well. The American people need to mourn what they did by electing him president. We have to mourn who we’ve become by electing him. We have to mourn the fact that many of us have normalized him. We have to mourn the fact that we’re ashamed of being Americans. We have to mourn the fact that it’s humiliating not to be allowed into any foreign country because of the pandemic and what he did to the country. We have to grieve what’s happened here in America with Donald Trump, because we will not grow as a people otherwise.
I believe that we can grow and mature as a people. But we have to confront the truth and our collective role in Trumpism. People don’t want to do that hard work. Those Americans who are binary thinkers will find it especially difficult to confront their decision to vote for Trump and then to mourn and mature.
Standing up to a bully in the form of Donald Trump is very important. But we also need to recognize internally that we didn’t stand up to him in the first place — and the reason we didn’t stand up to him was out of fear and weakness. We must also mourn the fact that so many people were in denial about just how bad Donald Trump as president would be.
You wrote a book several years ago about Donald Trump’s psychology and behavior. You were trying to warn the American people about the danger Trump represented. What are your thoughts about Mary Trump’s new book?
First of all, I think it is a really good book. She’s a very good and thoughtful writer. There was not any one thing in the book that surprised me about Trump’s psychology or psychodynamics. He’s a sadist. He’s a misogynist. He’s grandiose. He has no empathy. He’s not competent. He can’t really manage things. He’s always been rescued. Those are all things I wrote about in my book “Trump on the Couch.” She and I are in agreement.  Mary Trump was able to share specific details about Donald Trump that I would have had no way of knowing. For example, Trump mocked his father when he became senile. That was a very interesting detail because Donald Trump was always afraid of his father. He was never able to stand up to him. It was only when Trump’s father fell ill with Alzheimer’s that Donald Trump could stand up to him by mocking him.
I knew that Donald Trump had a learning disability. But I did not know that Trump paid someone to take his SAT exam.
Mary Trump identifies Trump’s father as the root of his mental pathologies. Do you agree?
Trump’s father and mother are both the source of his problems. Trump’s mother was cold and unavailable. How can you ever feel empathy if you’re not held? How can you ever feel love if you’re not responded to in a loving way and not paid attention to? Donald Trump was not mothered. This means he is unable to soothe, care for or empathize with the American people and their troubles.
What did you think about Mary Trump’s observation about his lies? In her book she writes, “It is a defense mechanism to protect himself against the reality of who he really is and if he actually understood it, he couldn’t bear it.” Your thoughts?
There are multiple levels of Trump’s lying. The first level, which is what Mary Trump writes about, is that Trump lies to compensate for his weaknesses and the fact that he knows that he is not who he pretends to be. Trump is not as strong and as big and powerful as he pretends to be. That is the origin of his lying as a child. When Trump was older, he lied to get money. Trump lied as part of his business.
But now, as president, Trump is being threatened with investigations and other consequences for his misdeeds. Now Trump is lying to save his life. He’s lying to protect himself. Trump may destroy America by sending his federal troops into the cities. Trump is doing other horrible things as well to save himself. Trump’s lies are directed at protecting himself.
All these types of lying are based on one thing, which is the original lie. Trump lies so much because he was lied to as a child. He was lied to when his parents probably told him, “I love you.” Trump knew that his parents did not love him. Trump knew he wasn’t loved by his father or his mother. With compulsive liars they are usually lying because they are deflecting outward a trauma that happened to them. Because Donald Trump was lied to as a child, he has lied to everyone else ever since.
Donald Trump thinks that people do not like him and that they are all out to get him.
What are some details from Mary Trump’s new book that you found particularly provocative and insightful?
The most painful thing about Trump to me is that he really envies people who are loved. Trump hates people who are loved. Trump hated Obama not just because he made the mistake of being president while black, Trump also hates Obama because he was loved. Trump hates these children of immigrants where the mothers carry their babies from El Salvador, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and other dangerous places to find safety in America. These mothers love their children. Trump’s reaction is to break up the families, to separate the mothers from their babies. It is an attack on children but also an attack on love. When Trump breaks up the families of migrants and refugees he is really saying, “You’re going to feel what I felt because my mother was separated from me and I’m going to punish you. I can’t stand the fact that I see someone being loved and it’s not me. Every time I see someone being loved, it reminds me of what I was missing. It reminds me of my yearnings, which I have to deny always.”
Given his psychological profile, how is Donald Trump likely responding to Mary Trump’s book?
He’s very angry at her because anybody who criticizes him is betraying him. Again, Trump is lying to save his life right now. Her book helps to confirm Trump’s criminal behavior. That is also why Trump did not want John Bolton’s book to be released either. Trump does not want anyone to speak the truth about what he is doing. It is not about his reputation, ultimately. Donald Trump hates Mary Trump because she could put him in jail.
What counsel would you offer the American people about overcoming the terror they feel about Donald Trump and what he represents and then moving from inaction to action?
Together, we can be stronger, and we need to find other people with us who will help stand up to the bully. The Black Lives Matter movement is doing this. We will need determination, which is what Rep. John Lewis’ life stood for.
A person must be determined when he or she stands up to a bully. Having a moral compass makes this easier. When you stand up to the bully you may still get beaten up. But you have to stand up to the bully anyway. That is why interdependence and cooperation are so very important in this moment when we need to stand up against the national bully Donald Trump. What makes a person stand up against the bully and do the right thing? Having a sense of right and wrong and not being dominated by fear.

0,2020-07-31T11:38:03+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/19-on-the-strip-las-vegas-workers-are-forced-to-gamble-with-their-lives/,COVID-19 on The Strip: Las Vegas workers are forced to gamble with their lives,"As Nevada’s COVID-19 deaths set new records daily throughout July, rumors raged that Gov. Steve Sisolak would soon re-close Las Vegas casinos.
But that would be too late for 22  dead employees.
Donald Trump ignored medical advice and pressed states to “liberate” their economies. The mega-casinos of the famed “strip” responded by ending their 78-day shutdown as fast as a craps shooter can throw dice. There were no rules requiring safe practices.
Porter Adolfo Fernandez went back to work June 4 as eager gamblers flooded into Caesars Palace, most following Trump’s example by refusing to wear masks to halt the deadly coronavirus.
“The company is not keeping us safe. I know I’m gonna get sick,” Fernandez told his daughter, Irma. The hard-working 51-year-old knew his high blood pressure put him at great risk, but he had a family to feed and bills to pay. In two weeks, he came home with a fever and went straight to bed.
“Now he’s in heaven,” Irma said softly, almost whispering, through flowing tears.  “Why was Caesars so careless, so heartless?”
Fernandez, who succumbed to the virus June 24, was a member of Culinary Workers Local 226, the branch of the UNITE HERE labor union that includes 60,000 Las Vegas hotel, food service, bar and casino workers.
Union Files Suit
Irma spoke for him June 29, as the union announced a federal lawsuit against three of the hotel-casinos, charging they had violated their duty to protect the workers, their families and the community.
They failed, it is alleged, to properly warn members or disinfect and quarantine when some tested positive for COVID-19.
The suit demands that management enforce social distancing, mandate face masks, have rooms cleaned daily and provide PPE and testing for employees. The union is also pressing Sisolak, a Democrat, and the state legislature to enact the Adolfo Fernandez Bill to require the casinos to follow safety procedures.
“Behind every worker is a family,” said union head Geoconda Arguello-Kline.
At the Cosmopolitan luxury hotel, Stella Kalaoram and her family were hit hard when the guest room attendant fell ill in July. “She was exposed at work, and now she can’t breathe on her own. We’re really worried,” said daughter Sara. “My dad, my brother and I are all positive for COVID-19.”
The hospitalization rate for union members and their families spiked 860% after the casinos reopened. By late July, COVID-19 had put 352 of them in the hospital and killed 22, said communications director Bethany Khan.
Thousands Protest
As the casinos prepared to reopen, Local 226 organized a caravan of 10,000 members down the strip asking the Gaming Commission and casinos to make safety procedures mandatory. But the drive for quick profits drowned out their message.
The lawsuit blames the federal and state agencies responsible for protecting workers’ lives and health: “OSHA and Nevada OSHA [which follows federal standards] have not issued guidelines” and “have de-prioritized inspections and enforcement,” it says.
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration was on the verge of issuing a standard – an enforceable set of safety rules – to protect employees from infectious diseases in the workplace. Then Trump took office and halted all work on the regulation, said George Washington University professor David Michaels, who led OSHA under President Barack Obama.
Trump ‘Refused to Protect Workers’
Michaels places the responsibility for thousands of COVID-19 deaths on Trump’s doorstep: “The disease standard would have saved lives, but his tragic order halted all work on it,” Michaels told DCReport. “In his massive deregulatory effort, he refused to protect workers’ safety and health.”
The life-saving standard was researched, drafted and ready for adoption, he told us, “so they could put it out tomorrow as a temporary emergency standard.” Without the standard, he said, “millions of American workers are literally risking their lives every day on the job.”
The U.S. Labor Department’s OSHA is the only federal agency with the power to protect workers. But under Trump, “OSHA is suffering from malign neglect and almost completely missing from the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the low regard Trump has for the lives of American workers,” Michaels said.
The agency’s vital roster of inspectors is “the smallest it has been in 40 years,” key leadership positions are vacant, and officials have exempted most employers from its requirement to report cases where workers get COVID-19 on the job.
No Safety Requirements
Instead of the infectious disease standard, OSHA issued “guidance” about COVID-19. The difference between a standard and the guidance is immense, said Michaels: “Guidance is non-enforceable. This is simply shameful!”
In Congress, Democratic representatives called on Trump Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to order the emergency standard, and Senate Democrats pressed for it in recent coronavirus legislation. Neither could overcome Republican opposition. Instead of protecting employees and their families, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) demanded that legislation under consideration in late July immunize employers against lawsuits for failing to provide safe working conditions, like the one Local 226 has filed.
Plaintiff Jonathan Munoz, a food server for the $8.6 billion-a-year Caesars Entertainment conglomerate, explained the union’s position in simple terms: “All we want is for them to treat us like humans, not like machines that make money for them. If I get sick, are they going to take care of my family?”

According to the New York Times‘ Maggie Haberman, Trump called Inhofe while he was sitting in a Washington Italian restaurant Wednesday evening. Trump was so loud that the entire conversation was recorded by someone nearby.
“The conversation, overheard and recorded by someone in the room, ranged from a discussion about Anthony Tata, the retired Army brigadier general whose nomination for a top Pentagon policy position has become complicated, to Mr. Trump’s desire to preserve the name of Robert E. Lee, a Confederate general, on a military base,” said the report.
“We’re gonna keep the name of Robert E. Lee?” Trump asked Inhofe.
“Just trust me, I’ll make it happen,” Inhofe said.
“I had about 95,000 positive retweets on that. That’s a lot,” said Trump, citing a Tweet he posted last Friday. Inhofe promised he wouldn’t change the names of “military forts and bases” and that the senator “is not a believer in ‘Cancel Culture.’”
The Senate already passed a defense reauthorization that had in the bill that the base names would be changed. The vote was 86-14, which Trump has threatened to veto. But with such a margin, Trump’s veto could be overridden.
Trump then went off about “cancel culture” and told Inhofe that people “want to be able to go back to life.” Trump dismissed the shift taking place as Americans grow increasingly opposed to overt expressions of racism.
They also discussed the potential of someone “resigning” and how to put them in another appointment, which then evolved into a conversation about Gen. Tata, whose nomination to a Pentagon post was stalled after attacks he made on Twitter about Muslims and calling former President Barack Obama a “terrorist leader.”

The video is not a 30 or 60-second ad as is traditional in elections but is a short film that lasts over six minutes.
Directed by Jon Turteltaub, the video imagines a young Republican waking up from a three-year coma and being updated by his family about Trump illegally paying off a porn star, Mexico not paying for the wall, Trump praising white nationalists after the fatal Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally and his administration’s failed response to the coronavirus pandemic.
“It would be funny if it wasn’t so true,” Lincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson said. “Republican Senators are doing the same mental gymnastics to justify their support of Trump. But no one is laughing.”

0,2020-07-31T11:11:40+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/right-wing-nonprofits-hit-with-criminal-complaint-on-tax-violations-and-self-dealing/,Right-wing nonprofits hit with criminal complaint on tax violations and self-dealing,"A nonprofit public watchdog filed a complaint Thursday with the Internal Revenue Service, the state of Wisconsin and the California attorney general’s office accusing the conservative activist group American Majority (AM) of violating the federal tax code and various state laws.
The complaint, filed by the nonpartisan Campaign for Accountability (CfA) and exclusively obtained by Salon, accuses the nonprofit and its related dark-money advocacy arm, American Majority Action Inc. (AMA), of unlawfully putting more than half its expenses toward political activity and concealing donor information from regulators.
Additionally, the watchdog alleges that the groups’ founder and CEO, Ned Ryun, has engaged for years in inappropriate self-dealing through a complex web of transactions.
“Ned Ryun claims that American Majority and American Majority Action are nonprofits working for the public interest. A close reading of their tax returns suggests, however, that these groups may be violating tax law and improperly funneling money to Mr. Ryun,” Daniel E. Stevens, CfA executive director, told Salon in a statement.
“State and federal regulators should investigate whether Mr. Ryun’s management of these nonprofits is violating the law,” Stevens added.
American Majority describes itself as “the nation’s premier conservative training organization.” Its purported mission is to establish and maintain a solid grassroots political infrastructure to organize and support new conservative leaders.
The group’s shadow entity, AMA, however, has a tax status that legally bars it from engaging primarily in political activity. AMA describes itself as “a national conservative organization dedicated to engaging citizens in the political process.”
Tax filings over the years show that the organizations raised about $27.8 million between 2008 and 2018, but the complaint points out numerous inconsistencies.
First, the complaint alleges that AMA engaged primarily in political activity. AMA claimed about $414,000 in total expenses on its 2016 tax filings, but disclosed spending $350,000 of that — or approximately 85 percent — on “direct and indirect political campaign activities.”
If true, that suggests a violation of the federal law that prohibits 501(c)(4) nonprofits from engaging primarily in political activity.
American Majority also appears to have reported incorrect information to the state of California regarding a major donor, a move that CfA says was intended to deceive regulators. That donor, according to the complaint, is Leonard Leo, former executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a conservative advocacy group that has had enormous influence in Donald Trump’s judicial appointments.
According to AM’s tax filings, the organization reported that Leo contributed $500,000 from an Alexandria, Virginia, address in 2015. But in its 2016 filings, AM reported a $500,000 contribution from a group called the Donors Capital Fund of Alexandria, Virginia.
Leo has reportedly been linked to Donors Capital, but CfA’s research does not show him to be an employee or officer. Instead, audits suggest that those two $500,000 donations came from the same donor, attributed to Leo one year and to Donors Capital the next.
The complaint alleges this is an attempt to hide the true source of the funds, because Donors Capital has been reported to fund anti-climate science activities and Islamophobic organizations, and has been characterized as something of an “ATM” for conservative dark-money donors.
In 2016, the year that AM’s filings listed Donors Capital, the group reported receiving $70.7 million in contributions and grants. The year before, Donors Capital took in about $60 million. But in 2017, Donors Capital reported receiving only $366,087.
Finally, the complaint details a complex scheme to secretly move money between nonprofits and for-profit entities in the interest of AM and AMA board members. The organizations kicked substantial amounts of money to Ryun himself, while simultaneously reporting massive losses.
“Mr. Ryun appears to have built a network of organizations designed to funnel money to his for-profit companies and pay himself a salary. State and federal regulators should not allow Mr. Ryun to take advantage of nonprofit tax laws designed to support organizations that benefit the public, not private individuals,” Stevens said in his statement to Salon.
The filing points out that in 2011, American Majority and AMA created a holding company called AM Action LLC. That holding company then set up a for-profit data firm, Voter Gravity Inc, and briefly invested in another data firm called Political Gravity.
Although AM and AMA delivered hundreds of thousands of dollars to AM Action LLC, the complaint says, that company still lost “a staggering amount of money.”
The two nonprofits haven’t disclosed additional contributions or loans since 2015, but the holding company, AM Action LLC, has reported a negative income totaling more than $1.7 million, according to the document.
AMA itself later reported a negative $953,544 adjustment in 2016, the complaint says, “perhaps as a recognition of this poor investment.”
CfA also claims the twin organizations extended loans and covered expenses for private companies connected to American Majority board members and employees.
Ryun’s nonprofits don’t appear to have received a return on their investment in Voter Gravity. According to the complaint, those numbers “represent a staggering loss” for the nonprofits.
“AMA appears to have reported to the IRS that the value of Voter Gravity declined dramatically and that AMA’s ownership interest share in Voter Gravity is now negative,” the complaint says. Beyond the losses, AMA allegedly took out nearly a million dollars worth of loans on behalf of Voter Gravity.
“Despite this bleak financial picture, Voter Gravity continued to pay a salary to Mr. Ryun,” says the complaint, detailing payments over several years that he received from all three entities, even as he declared massive losses.
CfA filed the complaint on Thursday morning. American Majority did not reply to Salon’s request for comment.

Despite his most inflammatory tweet of the day, President Donald Trump does not plan on moving the date of the November election. As many observers pointed out, his post floating this idea came shortly after news of the devastating economic growth numbers for the second quarter were released, and he was almost certainly trying to change the subject (not that threatening democracy will play well with the electorate). But Trump is likely aware that he lacks the power to move the election, and there’s no sign that he’s seriously lobbying his congressional allies to do so, especially since they’d need House Democrats to agree.
Yet his threat to democracy is real. Trump gave away the game on his plan to manipulate November’s results in a follow-up tweet on Thursday:
He has been laying the groundwork for this attack for months now with his aggressive and bogus criticisms of mail-in voting. This campaign has drawn some quizzical responses since it’s clearly discouraging Republicans from using mail-in ballots as they have done — quite effectively — for decades. Given that we’re in a pandemic, one that will surely be ongoing if not resurgent in November, it seems on its face to be a form of self-sabotage for the president to discourage his own supporters from the safest form of voting.
But Trump’s second tweet sets the stage for his strategy. If Democrats dominate mail-in voting, that may mean Trump could lead when the Election Day ballots start to get counted on Nov. 3. If Joe Biden has won, that may only become evident when the mail-in ballots are counted. Because there’s likely to be a surge of mail-in voting, state election operations are likely to be underfunded, and the Trump administration seems to be deliberately slowing down the mail, it may take a while for these votes to be counted. It could potentially take weeks.
And there are bound to be other irregularities, as well, because there always are. What happens if the Post Office slows down delivery of the mail, and it’s not clear if a certain set of ballots were sent at the right time? This kind of dispute — and many others — could lead to tense legal challenges.
The president is already making it clear, however, that he wants to simply accept the results as they’re first reported Tuesday night (he’ll surely do an about-face if Biden is the winner early on). Of course, this is a completely baseless demand. States are obligated to count all votes legitimately cast, and they are allowed time to do so:
So there’s no legal argument on the president’s side, just as he has no authority to change the election date. But that doesn’t really matter. Many people pointed out in April that, despite Trump’s demands that states reopen their economies prematurely in the face of the pandemic, the president had no power to boss the governors around. But Trump won that argument — and triggered a resurgence of the virus — because the GOP will follow him off any cliff.
Trump’s real power is his control over his voters and his party. He’s coaching them to treat mail-in ballots as illegitimate — even as he hopelessly tries to make a distinction between mail-in and absentee ballots, which he uses (they’re the same). If he wins the Election Day vote, but fears — as seems likely — that a deluge of mail-in ballots will hand the race to Biden, he could push to undercut these votes.
And he’d have multiple allies in that fight. For example, Republicans control the legislatures of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan — three crucial swing states. State legislatures are fundamentally in charge of determining how electors get selected for the electoral college. Of course, right now, in most states, the candidate who wins the most votes in the state gets all the electoral votes. And in theory, the legislatures shouldn’t be able to change the rules after the votes have already been cast. But what if the ballot counting is dragging on, and legal disputes are breaking out. Irregularities will abound, and feed conspiracy theories. A GOP swing state legislature infected by Trump’s propaganda may try to claim that the election is inherently corrupted, and it may decide to take matters into its own hands — and hand victory to Trump.
Could it actually do that? It’s hard to say in advance, but any attempt would inevitably end up in court. There, the legal challenges would meet more Trump allies in the form of conservative judges and justices, who just happen to have a majority on the Supreme Court, where any consequential dispute would inevitably end up.
Chief Justice John Roberts may give the president’s opponents some hope. He has been willing to break with Trump and the entire Republican Party in many high-profile cases in recent decisions, sometimes shocking his liberal critics. So there’s no guarantee that he’d be in the bag to hand the election to Trump.
There’s a big caveat here, though. One consistent feature of Roberts’ jurisprudence, including in recent rulings, is a clear hostility to voting rights. The only consistency in his judgments on this front seems to be favoritism for moves that suppress the vote and help Republicans. So it wouldn’t be surprising if Roberts led the court in a repeat of Bush v. Gore in some heated legal battle, handing the election to Trump.
It wouldn’t even need to be this blatant, because the key to Trump’s strategy is chaos. If, after some set of legal disputes and quarrels over which ballots are legitimate, there’s no clear winner in the Electoral College, the decision gets sent to the House of Representatives. But because of a quirk in the Constitution, each member doesn’t get their own vote — there’s only one vote per state. This system would seem to favor Trump.
It’s not clear the president has thought all this through and gamed out a complete strategy. He’s not much of a planner. But he clearly knows the polls are not looking good for him, and it’s undeniable that — as he did in 2016 — he’s laying the groundwork for challenging the legitimacy of the election. The terrifying thing is that it could work.

0,2020-07-31T00:15:36+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/alabama-state-lawmaker-resigns-as-pastor-after-attending-party-for-kkk-leader/,Alabama state lawmaker resigns as pastor after attending party for KKK leader,"Republican State Rep. Will Dismukes (R-Prattville) of Alabama is making more being-a-racist news. On Thursday, Dismukes announced he would be stepping down as pastor of Pleasant Hill Baptist Church in Prattville. This comes after days and weeks of controversy surrounding the Alabama state representative and his relationship to race and racist organizations in the state.
The most recent controversy comes after Dismukes attended and then gave the invocation at the annual birthday party for first grand wizard of the KKK and Confederate general traitor Nathan Bedford Forrest on July 25 in Selma. The event coincided with ceremonies honoring the late U.S. representative and civil rights activist John Lewis’ passing. Rep. Dismukes posted about the event on his Facebook page the following day, writing: “Had a great time at Fort Dixie speaking and giving the invocation for Nathan Bedford Forrest annual birthday celebration. Always a great time and some sure enough good eating!!”
Very quickly, Alabama Baptist officials distanced themselves from Dismukes’ attendance of the event. Rick Lance, executive director of the Alabama Baptist State Board of Missions, told Alabama Baptist Media: “We are saddened and grieved to learn of the recent Facebook post by state Rep. Will Dismukes. … In the wake of tremendous controversy we reaffirm our opposition to any kind of racism.” Subsequently Dismukes was contacted by other Baptist officials in the state, with whom he met and decided to resign from his post as pastor. According to the Montgomery Advertiser, Dismukes says he has no plans to leave his position in state government.
Back in June, Dismukes came under fire for his support of state funding for a Confederate memorial park in Alabama, as well as his membership in a local Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter in Prattville. At the time, Rep. Dismukes told reporters that he didn’t support “slavery in any fashion,” but just “because I want to protect our history doesn’t mean I’m all of a sudden glorifying the days of slavery or anything of that nature.”
Dismukes’ Facebook page is filled with the kind of thinking about race and activism and flags that you might expect from someone who believes speaking at the birthday celebration for the founder of the KKK is patriotic and godly in some fashion. It’s a lot of why are people kneeling during the national anthem, and criticisms of Dr. Anthony Fauci, and questioning the need to wear masks.

0,2020-07-30T23:45:08+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/whats-behind-the-extreme-charges-for-3-nonviolent-protesters-in-salt-lake-city/,What’s behind the extreme charges for 3 nonviolent protesters in Salt Lake City?,"Salt Lake City is a world apart from the rest of Utah culturally and politically, and its choice of district attorney shows that—at least on a surface level. Sim Gill, first elected to the seat in 2010, has made some modest criminal justice reform moves, like expressing support for reducing the number of people on probation or court supervision. As a first-generation immigrant from India, he’s one of the few Asian-American elected prosecutors nationwide. Faced with a conservative Republican challenger in 2018, Gill emerged victorious by 14 percentage points.
However, DA Gill’s recent reaction to the vandalizing of his office shows a different, more vindictive side to him. In early July, protesters gathered to criticize Gill for refusing to indict the police officer who killed a young Latino man named Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal. A group of protesters allegedly painted “the road outside of the district attorney’s downtown Salt Lake City office and its facade red.” On July 28, three protesters, all women no older than 25, were charged with several criminal mischief and rioting felonies.
The local paper originally reported the criminal mischief charges as first-degree felonies, which carry a minimum sentence of five years in prison and a maximum of life under state law. However, there is no first-degree felony under the statute. Assuming the women were charged under the harshest provision under that particular criminal law, a second-degree felony, they would all be facing one-to-fifteen years in prison on just one of the charges filed.
Buildings and streets can be repainted. No violence was alleged, nor any threat of violence. So the worst that this incident represents is property damage. What was the DA thinking?
Unfortunately, Salt Lake County DA Sim Gill has a tendency to react this way when challenged. For example, when Utah County Commissioners were poised to create the state’s first commission on prosecutorial misconduct, Gill joined then-Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman and others to decry it as a violative encroachment on prosecutors’ authority. Even though the commission would only have affected the Utah County DA office, and even though Buhman had a documented record of alleged misconduct and bullying of defense attorneys.
Gill’s defensiveness came in the context of his questionable ongoing political durability. In Utah County, the second-largest in the state, new Republican DA David Leavitt is just as “progressive” as Gill, if not more so. He ran as a pro-reform counterpoint to Buhman; after taking office, he has deprioritized drug cases, to the chagrin of many in the local law enforcement rank and file. These moves are braver to make in a place like Utah County, which has a much more traditional, tough-on-crime electorate than Salt Lake County. Meanwhile, Gill has refused to support marijuana legalization or the end to mandatory minimum prison sentences for drugs in his jurisdiction, the much more liberal Salt Lake County.
Then there were the revelations in a September 2018 Buzzfeed expose that at least four women were vying to use a state constitutional provision to initiate prosecutions against the men they accused of sexually assaulting them. All four were vocally disappointed that DA Gill’s office found their allegations unconvincing, and found an ally in University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell, a prominent victims’ rights advocate who represented one of the women in court. It was the kind of bombshell story that ends some elected prosecutors’ careers, though it failed to get much attention in the local press.
Gill, a registered Democrat, probably won reelection last time mainly due to the influence of partisan politics. A 2017 analysis found that nearly all of Utah’s Democratic legislators come from Salt Lake City and surrounding areas. In 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by nine points in Salt Lake County—a margine which likely would have been larger if not for Utah voters’ affinity for independent third-party candidates. By September, the partisan primaries were closed, and Gill’s only opponent was Nathan Evershed, his former deputy, who ran as a Republican without the advantage of incumbency.
Since winning re-election, Gill said that “justice reform” would be his main focus, which means that he is setting himself up for failure in 2022. Despite his occasionally announcing abstract support for a more humane and proportional justice system—especially the kinds of everyday cases that fall through the national media cracks—his promise belies the truth on the ground.
With criticism levied against him for not charging officers, Gill is again proclaiming support for reforms, this time squarely on the issue of police accountability. Ironically, Ian Adams, the leader of the Utah Fraternal Order of Police, was actually more believable when he said that Gill’s real police reform proposal is “to save Sim Gill’s job.” But perhaps some outcry over felony charges for three young, nonviolent protesters will make that harder than ever.

0,2020-07-30T23:28:51+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/its-medicare-and-medicaids-55th-birthday-lets-expand-benefits-not-cut-them/,It’s Medicare and Medicaid’s 55th birthday: Let’s expand benefits — not cut them,"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. This crowning achievement was both the culmination of a decades-long effort to attain guaranteed universal health insurance and the first step in the quest for Medicare for All.
In the 55 years since the legislation was signed into law, both programs have proven their worth. Before Medicare, about half of seniors lacked health insurance. They were an illness away from bankruptcy. Today, 99.1 percent of Americans 65 and older are insured, thanks to Medicare. Nine million people with disabilities who are under age 65 also have health insurance coverage through Medicare.
More than 65 million Americans have health insurance coverage through Medicaid. Medicaid ensures that poor families have access to health care. It means that seniors and people with disabilities have access to long-term care. Together, Medicare and Medicaid cover more than one-third of the people in our country.
Seniors and people with disabilities have, on average, the highest medical costs. Administering a means-tested program like Medicaid presents administrative challenges. That is why it is so striking that Medicare and Medicaid are more efficient and more cost-effective than private health insurance. It would save money to expand Medicare to cover everyone.
Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages across our country, it’s long past time to improve Medicare and expand its coverage to everyone. Imagine how much worse off we would be right now if Medicare and Medicaid did not exist. And imagine how much better off and better prepared to cope with the pandemic we would be if everyone were covered automatically by an improved Medicare—if people knew that if they felt sick, they could get checked without any copays or deductibles. Imagine if losing employment did not also mean losing health care.
Unfortunately, Republicans, aided by a small fringe group of Democrats, want to go in the opposite direction. The latest Republican COVID-19 proposal, the so-called HEALS Act, includes a bill called the TRUST Act.
The TRUST Act is a devious ploy to dismantle Medicare as we know it, by creating a closed-door process to fast-track benefit cuts. Using the COVID-19 crisis to sneak it through is the worst possible way to say “happy birthday” to Medicare and Medicaid.
Fortunately, Democratic leaders like Sen. Ron Wyden, Rep. Richard Neal, and Rep. John Larson have been outspoken in their opposition to the bill. So have advocates for seniors, including AARP, which rightfully calls the TRUST Act “a bill that is unrelated to the crisis and that wrongly targets Social Security and Medicare to reduce deficits that have expanded because of needed pandemic relief.”
Congressional leaders must heed these wise words and throw the TRUST Act in the scrap heap where it belongs. Then, they must build on the foundation LBJ signed into law 55 years ago by expanding Medicare and Medicaid instead of cutting them.
During a pandemic that is disproportionately threatening people of color, expanding these programs would be a powerful force for racial justice—just as their creation was. Medicare and Medicaid became law the year after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Hospitals were only allowed to participate in Medicare if they complied with the Civil Rights Act. This led to the desegregation of hospitals throughout the South, improving the quality of care available to people of color.
This was a quiet yet profound achievement. Overnight integration of hospitals, where patients and health care providers interact in the most personal of ways, was a revolution for racial justice. Extending health insurance to low-income Americans, who are disproportionately people of color, was an important step for racial economic justice.
Among the responses demanded by a life-threatening pandemic and the righteous pronouncement that Black Lives Matter should be the expansion of Medicare and Medicaid to a universal program without premiums, co-pays or deductibles.
As a first step, Congress should pass the Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act, which Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) introduced in response to the pandemic. It would guarantee health care (with no out-of-pocket costs) to all Americans for the duration of the pandemic. This is a commonsense public health measure. The last thing we want during a pandemic is for anyone to forgo needed care due to cost concerns.
Congress should then make the guaranteed health care permanent, enacting Medicare for All. As an incremental step, Congress could help struggling families by passing MediKids to provide health care for all children, as the architects of Medicare envisioned as the next step on the road to Medicare for All. They could lower the Medicare age to 55, which would be essential for older workers who lost their jobs due to the pandemic and may never return to the workforce.
In addition to expanding Medicare and Medicaid to cover more people, Congress should improve the programs for current beneficiaries. The COVID-19 crisis in our nation’s nursing homes reveals the need for the government to cover long-term care in home and community settings, rather than funneling people into institutions. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has a plan to do just that. Medicare coverage should also be expanded to include hearing, vision, and dental care.
Medicare and Medicaid are turning 55 amidst some of the most tumultuous times our country has experienced since the Great Depression. Frances Perkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s secretary of labor, astutely recognized, “We must devise plans that will not merely alleviate the ills of today, but will prevent, as far as it is humanly possible to do so, their recurrence in the future.”
Policymakers should heed her words, and take the steps necessary to both alleviate this pandemic and prevent the next one. That includes improving Medicare and Medicaid, and expanding them to cover everyone in America.

0,2020-07-30T23:03:26+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-constitution-isnt-a-pact-but-one-more-trump-appointment-could-change-that/,The Constitution isn’t a suicide pact — but one more Trump appointment could change that,"In the annals of American jurisprudence, few legal adages have gained wider currency or proven more adaptable to changing times and circumstances than the phrase, “The Constitution is not a suicide pact.”
While the exact provenance of the dictum is unclear, the expression is most often attributed to a dissenting opinion written in 1949 by the late Supreme Court Associate Justice Robert Jackson in the case of Terminiello v. Chicago.
Terminiello is one of the Supreme Court’s major decisions on “hate speech.” By a vote of 5-4, the court overturned the criminal conviction of Father Arthur Terminiello, a suspended Catholic priest, who had been charged with disturbing the peace for delivering a virulently anti-Semitic speech that incited rioting and vandalism.
Jackson, whose unique and storied legal career included a leave of absence he took from the Supreme Court in 1945 to serve as the chief U.S. prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, refused to join the majority, arguing instead that Terminiello’s tirades exceeded the boundaries of protected discourse. His dissent ended with a stark warning:
There is danger that, if the Court does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.
Jackson was on the losing side in Terminiello and rightly so, as Father Terminiello’s speech, while vile and repulsive, presented no clear and present danger to the social order. But Jackson’s sober admonition survived Terminiello and has been cited with approval in a variety of later Supreme Court rulings as a reminder that in the constant tension between civil liberties and official acts of government aimed at promoting the common good, context and balance are important for fair adjudications.
Jackson’s wisdom is urgently needed today in the fight against COVID-19. The deadly and highly contagious disease isn’t just sending Americans to the hospital and the grave. It’s also sending some to court in a determined effort to weaken the fight.
According to a database maintained by Hunton Andrews Kurth, a blue-chip, business-oriented law firm headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, more than 3,900 lawsuits related to COVID-19 have been registered in state and federal courts since the arrival of the virus in the U.S. The cases span the legal spectrum, ranging from complaints lodged against nursing homes and objections to prison conditions to workplace safety claims, requests for university tuition reimbursements, and, above all, constitutional challenges to state and local lockdown policies.
From New York to Michigan and California to Hawaii, state and local actions designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 have come under fierce legal attack. Funded by a panoply of aggrieved business owners, right-wing non-profit organizations, private citizens and religious organizations, a dizzying array of lawsuits have been filed to invalidate shelter-in-place orders and other mitigation measures that impose quarantines on out-of-state travelers, temporarily suspend the operation of high-risk and non-essential businesses, and require face masks to be worn in public places.
Although most mitigation measures to-date have been upheld by lower courts, the litigation is ongoing and unrelenting.
Three of the most high-profile constitutional challenges have already reached the Supreme Court, brought as emergency petitions by churches based in Illinois, California and Nevada to enjoin state-issued executive orders restricting the number of people permitted to attend religious services. The high court has denied relief in all three, but only by the slimmest of 5-4 margins.
The California case—South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, decided on May 29—revealed deep, dangerous and familiar ideological divisions on the court, with Chief Justice John Roberts yet again casting the tribunal’s swing vote. Reaching back into Supreme Court history, Roberts drafted a brief but illuminating three-page opinion, in which he concluded:
“Although California’s guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment…
“Our Constitution principally entrusts ‘[t]he safety and the health of the people’ to the politically accountable officials of the States ‘to guard and protect.’ … When those officials ‘undertake[ ] to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties,’ their latitude ‘must be especially broad.’ … Where those broad limits are not exceeded, they should not be subject to second-guessing by an ‘unelected federal judiciary,’ which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people.”
The primary Supreme Court precedent cited by Roberts to justify his position—Jacobson v. Massachusetts—was handed down in 1905 in the midst of a deadly smallpox outbreak, long before many of the advances in modern medicine and epidemiology were made that we now take for granted. In a majority opinion written by Justice John Marshall Harlan, who is perhaps best known for penning the lone dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, the court endorsed a Massachusetts law requiring compulsory vaccination.
In language that could easily be transported to the threat posed by COVID-19, Harlan declared:
“[T]he liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. …
“Upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.”
Undeterred by Jacobson and unpersuaded by Roberts, the current court’s contingent of four hardcore conservatives—Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh—would have granted injunctive relief on grounds of religious liberty in both the California and Nevada disputes. (The court’s ruling in the Illinois case was issued in the form of an unsigned two-paragraph order that did not reveal the voting alignment of the justices.)
After the Nevada decision (Calvary Chapel v. Sisolak) was released on July 24, right-wing Republican politicians blasted Roberts for siding once more with the court’s liberals. Coming completely unhinged, Texas Senator Ted Cruz tweeted that Roberts had “abandoned his oath.”
Roberts and the liberals, however, maintain only a tenuous majority on the court on matters related to COVID-19. That majority, while good for now, is as frail as the declining health of 87-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It would take only one more Trump appointment to the bench for the majority to disappear.
In the meantime, as the pandemic continues to rage and as many states are forced to resume and maintain lockdown practices, we can expect more legal challenges to come before the Supreme Court, leaving the justices and the nation as a whole with the grim reality that in the face of COVID-19, we have two bottom-line choices—the protection of public health or constitutional suicide.

0,2020-07-30T22:25:00+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-threat-to-the-election-is-a-distraction-but-its-also-serious/,Trump’s threat to the election is a distraction — but it’s also deadly serious,"The first thing to understand about Donald Trump’s threat to delay the November election — should we call it a public fantasy? — is that it’s a distraction, like so many things our president says and does.
Around 8:30 Eastern time on Thursday morning, news came down that the U.S. economy saw its worst contraction since the advent of modern economic recordkeeping after World War II, with GDP falling at an annual rate of nearly 33% in the second quarter, 9.5% below where it was the previous quarter. This is a plunge exponentially larger than the fallout from the crash of 2008, and probably the largest since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
At 8:46 a.m., Trump let loose with this Twitter turd: “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???”
As a distraction, the gambit worked. Immediately, the shift in headlines and cable news focus went from the country’s record-setting economic devastation toward this idiotic but deeply troubling question of whether Trump can really get away with delaying the election until such time as he thinks he can win it (which may be never).
The second thing to understand about Trump’s threat is that it’s nonetheless deadly serious. No matter how many reassuring articles come out about how there’s no mechanism available to Trump to delay the election, the public should not be complacent about this.
Rule of law, for the people who surround Donald Trump and prop him up, is something to be broken, not respected. Trump is a profoundly stupid man, but he does have a flight of much smarter people around him to do his bidding, especially when it comes to securing power for themselves and shutting down the ability of the American people to vote the bastards out.
We should not underestimate what people like Attorney General Bill Barr and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could come up with, if they decide that Trump’s harebrained notion of using the pandemic as cover to “reschedule” (read: cancel) the election is the only path to keeping Republicans in power in 2021.
Barr, after all, has spent his time in charge of the Justice Department focused on remaking the institution as one focused on covering up Trump’s crimes, instead of dedicated to fighting crime. He started by using his powers to falsely frame the findings of Robert Mueller’s report on Russian election interference, claiming that Mueller found “no collusion.” That was an outright lie. Mueller found extensive collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian conspiracy, much of it right out in public, even if it fell short of what Mueller felt could be charged as criminal conspiracy. But Barr successfully pushed out the “no collusion” narrative, and the impact of the entire Russia investigation dwindled to almost nothing, despite Trump’s demonstrable guilt in the cover-up.
Since then, Barr has been dedicated to the single-minded goal of making sure Trump’s power is secure and untouched by the meager concerns of people who believe in democracy, the rule of law or accountability. He’s pushed out U.S. attorneys for being insufficiently corrupt and compliant, backed Trump’s outrageous lies about voter fraud, helped spring Trump’s cronies from prison, and enthusiastically supported Trump’s expanding experiment in using federal police as a fascistic armed force to suppress dissent.
So, yes, Trump is both dumb and cowardly. But he has Barr at his side, an intelligent but dark-hearted man who has never hesitated to lie, cheat or swindle to secure Republican power. Above all other things, Barr is good at coming up with legal rationales to gut democracy and the rule of law. There’s good reason to suspect that he’d view the problem of concocting legal rationales for canceling or delaying the election not as a repulsive task but a fun and exciting challenge — exactly the sort of authoritarian overreach he came out of retirement to enact.
Trump also has McConnell by his side, a Machiavellian wizard of politics who has never met a line he won’t cross when it comes to securing power for himself and the Republican Party.
McConnell has already used a delaying tactic to steal one of the highest offices in the land from a Democratic president who had the legal and constitutional right to control it, and deliver it to a conservative who will hold that office until he dies or retires.
The mainstream media has basically forgotten about this, but we should not: Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first nominee, holds a seat that should have belonged to Merrick Garland, Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia after the latter’s death in 2016. McConnell didn’t even bother to come with some elaborate legal justification for holding the seat open until (he hoped) a Republican president could fill it. He made some bad-faith argument about the looming election, but gleefully abandoned it once he no longer needed it. The whole maneuver was unconstitutional (or, in the most generous possible interpretation, extra-constitutional), but McConnell got away with it because, as it turned out, no one in Washington had the power to stop him.
That’s also the question we must consider when it comes to Trump attempts to hold power through some sort of coup, as he has increasingly indicated he’s willing to do. Even if he can’t delay the election — and there’s no obvious remotely legal way to do that — by making these demands, Trump is laying more groundwork for declaring the election fraudulent and rejecting the results if and when he loses in November. He’s surrounded by powerful people, such as McConnell and Barr, who are likely to back his play, especially if they see no other way to hang onto power.
Just because there’s no visible mechanism for how they might do that is no reason to relax. Barr and McConnell are pretty much kept alive, at this point, by coming up with innovative, bad-faith ways to “interpret” the law in order to undermine what remains of our democracy.
Sure, whatever Trump tries to do to hang onto power in the face of an actual or impending electoral defeat — delaying the election, rejecting the results — will technically be illegal.
But I often think of the scene in the first season of “Game of Thrones” when Ned Stark presents Cersei Lannister with a document that gives him, not her, the right to sit on the throne. She tears the paper up and throws it down, saying, “Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark? A piece of paper?” You know, before having him arrested and, eventually, beheaded in public.
The Constitution didn’t stop McConnell from stealing a Supreme Court seat. The rule of law hasn’t slowed Barr down one bit. We will need more than futile gestures toward the sanctity of the law to keep Trump and his minions from doing whatever they can to steal the election.
We can only hope that Democrats understand this and are working on a plan. For instance, they need a clear and secure way to swear Joe Biden into office on Jan. 20 — as the Constitution specifically mandates — out of the reach of Trump’s shadowy “federal police.” They need to know that the Secret Service and the leadership of the military will cooperate in an orderly transfer of power, and will accept or enforce the rule of law.
To drive Donald Trump from office, we can’t rely on a piece of paper. It simply isn’t enough.

He doesn’t appear on MSNBC to lambast the Republican Party or write denunciations of the White House for The Bulwark. But in a new piece for the New York Times on Thursday, he offered a blistering rebuke to President Donald Trump’s suggestion on Twitter that he may seek to delay the November election.
Calabresi started with his Trumpist bona fides, confirming that he’s not inclined to criticize the president:
I have voted Republican in every presidential election since 1980, including voting for Donald Trump in 2016. I wrote op-eds and a law review article protesting what I believe was an unconstitutional investigation by Robert Mueller. I also wrote an op-ed opposing President Trump’s impeachment.
Then he continued, cutting to the heart of the matter:
But I am frankly appalled by the president’s recent tweet seeking to postpone the November election. Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate.
The United States has never in its history delayed a presidential election, he pointed out, and there’s no justification to do it now. Calabresi noted that it’s not even within Trump’s power to delay or cancel the election, and it’s up to states whether they want to use mail-in ballots, which the president has decried.
But unlike some political commentators who dismissed the president’s comments because he lacks the official capacity to carry them out, Calabresi took Trump’s threat seriously.
“President Trump needs to be told by every Republican in Congress that he cannot postpone the federal election,” he wrote. “Doing so would be illegal, unconstitutional and without precedent in American history. Anyone who says otherwise should never be elected to Congress again.”
Republicans in Congress — the people necessary to make good on the threat of impeachment that Calabresi raises — should follow his lead and hold the president’s feet to the fire. They ought to tell him: Back down or be replaced.

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Federal defenders and prosecutors in Portland, Oregon, have teamed up to try to end a court practice of releasing arrested protesters only after they have agreed not to attend protests — a restriction that legal experts called a clear violation of the constitutional right to free assembly.
There are early signs that the effort is working. After the joint request, a federal magistrate judge released two protesters without including restrictions on their attendance at protests or other mass events — or imposing a blanket curfew on them during evening hours. The same magistrate, Jolie A. Russo, had signed some of the release orders since July 23 that included protest bans.
ProPublica reported Tuesday that at least 12 protesters who had been held on federal charges in recent days had been instructed not to attend “protests, rallies, assemblies, or public gathering” (in the words of one order) between their release from jail and their trials. While the Trump administration has repeatedly said its involvement in Portland is targeted at violence and property destruction rather than peaceful protest, many of the affected defendants were being charged with petty offenses, such as “failure to obey a lawful order.”
A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office in Oregon, Kevin Sonoff, notified ProPublica on Wednesday evening about the joint request.
Before ProPublica’s article, defendants had often been barred from going within five blocks of the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse at any hour of the day and from leaving their homes at night. However, the orders signed Wednesday allow defendants to move freely in the city at night, although they are prohibited from going near the courthouse between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
The new restrictions are consistent with standard conditions of release before trials, according to experts, which often include “stay-away orders” preventing defendants from returning to the scene of the alleged crime.
The 12 defendants who were barred from protests between July 23 and July 27 will need to have modified release orders issued by the U.S. Pretrial Services, the office of the U.S. Courts that recommends release conditions.
Those modified orders are supposed to come out in the coming days, but ProPublica is not yet aware of any previously released protesters being told they are now free to protest.
The federal government deployed more than 100 agents of the Department of Homeland Security to Portland in early July to protect the federal courthouse from ongoing protests that had included some violence and property damage. State and local officials accused the federal government of overreach and blamed it for escalating tensions in the city.
On Wednesday, Oregon and DHS came to an agreement that cleared the path for federal officials to withdraw from the city in exchange for stepped-up enforcement by the state police.

Reporter McKenzie Sadeghi, in USA Today, fact-checks reports that Fauci warned President Donald Trump’s incoming administration about the possibility of a deadly outbreak in early 2017 and examines what the expert immunologist had to say three and a half years ago.
Sadeghi writes that it is inaccurate to claim that Fauci was warning about COVID-19 specifically in 2017, as the disease didn’t exist back then. But to say that Fauci was sounding the alarm about pandemics in general, Sadeghi explains, is absolutely correct.
“The claim that Dr. Anthony Fauci, in 2017, warned the (incoming) Trump administration of the likelihood of an infectious disease outbreak is true based on our research,” Sadeghi reports. “Fauci did not warn about the coronavirus specifically, as some posts claim, but rather, that a more general ‘surprise infectious disease outbreak’ would take place.”
According to Sadeghi, Fauci — in a January 10, 2017 speech — warned Trump’s incoming administration, “There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases…. The thing we’re extraordinarily confident about is that we’re going to see this in the next few years.”
That speech, Sadeghi notes, was part of an event billed as “Pandemic Preparedness in the Next Administration,” and Georgetown University has posted Fauci’s speech on YouTube.

“This is a coup in the making,” warned Robert Weisman, president of Public Citizen, in response to Trump.
“Voting by mail will not create a risk of fraud,” Weisman said. “In fact, voting by mail is an absolute necessity to ensure Americans can exercise their franchise amid a pandemic—which Trump has made dramatically worse through his utter incompetence and callous indifference to human life.”
Groups like Common Cause noted that the president does not have the power to postpone the election date.
Reminder: President Trump doesn’t have the constitutional authority to delay the election.
If he tries, we will see him in court.
— Common Cause (@CommonCause) July 30, 2020
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison pushed back on Trump’s tweet, responding, “This is how democracy dies in the USA. Don’t let it happen.”
“These messages from Trump are intended to promote chaos and confusion, and undermine confidence in our elections. We REJECT all of it,” tweeted Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
According to Stand Up America founder and president Sean Eldridge, the president’s tweets shouldn’t be brushed aside.
“As his latest comments show, Trump poses an existential threat to our democracy. While he has no authority to delay the election, we cannot ignore his escalating lies and attacks on our democracy,” Eldridge said in a statement.
“Americans need to be ready to mobilize if Trump contests the results or refuses to concede—and ‘Protect the Results‘ is building a network of millions of Americans to meet the moment if we need to take to the streets in protest,” he added.
Some critical observers wondered whether Trump’s tweet was an effort to stir up controversy or distract the media on the same day that data released from the Commerce Department showed the U.S. economy suffered its largest contraction in the country’s history last quarter.
This seems like the correct take. https://t.co/XKk0CYtGN9

“If Trump truly cared about our elections,” said Public Citizen’s Weisman, “he would demand Congress provide the $3.6 billion in funding that states and localities need to properly and safely administer them amid the pandemic. The real issue for Trump, of course, is Trump. The economy is in free-fall and Trump is worried about what that means for his electoral prospects.”
The president’s tweet Thursday comes less than two weeks after Trump—who’s trailing presumptive Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden in the polls—refused to commit to accepting the results of the 2020 presidential election if he is defeated.
Asked by Fox News‘ Chris Wallace whether he intends to accept the election results, the president responded, “No, I’m not gonna just say yes. I’m not gonna say it, and I didn’t last time either.”

On one hand, Rubin observes, Republican supporters of President Donald Trump have “adopted the swaggering tone and false bravado of high school athletes” and are expressing a false machismo that “too often morphs into cruelty.” But “more often than not,” Rubin argues, today’s GOP is “a party of sniveling victims and temper tantrums.”
Trump, according to Rubin, is setting a tone of self-pity among Republicans.
“Trump is certainly the host of the pity party,” Rubin writes. “He whines his approval ratings should be as high as those for respected doctors, whom he trashes. He moans that polls are rigged and concern about the pandemic is a ‘hoax,’ meant to depress the economy and deprive him of a second term. You would think an authoritarian wannabe would fear being seen as a crybaby by real autocrats such as Vladimir Putin.”
Rubin describes a recent congressional hearing in which executives from four major tech companies (Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon) were grilled by both Democrats and Republicans over their business practices, noting the contrasts between the types of questions they asked.
“Granted, Democrats frequently did not give the executives time to respond,” Rubin explains. “But they asked germane questions that got to fundamental questions about monopolistic power and its adverse effect on competitors and consumers. The Republicans? With few exceptions, they whined. Why wasn’t Trump’s son allowed to hawk hydroxychloroquine on Facebook?…. Why is it more difficult to find a story by a right-wing conspiracy mongering site on Google?”
Republicans, Rubin adds, have a sense of victimhood whether they are complaining about symbols of racism being removed from public places or the presence of “low-income housing” in suburbia.
“Increasingly, the Republican Party has adopted an agenda of hurt feelings and seething resentment,” Rubin argues. “The focus is inward-looking and not on the lives of ordinary Americans.”
Rubin wraps up her column by stressing that Republicans can’t have it both ways — they can’t be a macho party and “crybabies” at the same time.
“The reason Republicans are forever screaming and whining and accusing others is simple: victimhood and self-pity is becoming the core of what the GOP is about,” Rubin writes. “This surely is not the manly party it pretends to be.”

It’s hard to think of any activity that doesn’t induce some level of worry. The disruption of routines is by itself quite stressful. Everywhere we look, there is something to be concerned about. It’s so prevalent that we’re even freaking out that some people aren’t freaking out, because they’re not acting appropriately and therefore putting others at risk.
There are no quick and easy solutions, so no politician can magically return things to normal. What we need is someone who will tell us the important things to keep in mind. We need to know what we can do to help get things back to normal and to prevent things from getting worse. But we also need a leader who will do what they can to reduce the society-wide level of crippling stress we’re experiencing.
Some of this can be done through policy. Helping people avoid losing their homes and their access to health care would be a good start. Providing resources to schools so that they can do the best possible job of reopening, if possible, or teaching remotely, if necessary, is extremely important.
Giving the people consistently good information so that they are clear on the facts will reduce their stress levels. Confusion is the enemy, and providing a sense that the government has a grip on the situation is reassuring. Following a blueprint that has worked in many other countries to get the viral spread under control will make it possible to reopen more of the economy, which will save businesses and recreate and reactivate jobs. That would be a great stress reducer.
What we most definitely don’t need is a leader who adds unnecessary things to worry about. We shouldn’t be thinking about the “threat” of antifa. Federal officers shouldn’t be snatching peaceful protestors off the streets and throwing them in unmarked vans. We shouldn’t have to question our president’s motives for brashly pulling our troops out of Germany. We don’t need warnings that our idyllic suburban lifestyles are under threat.
President Trump began his campaign for the presidency by asking us to look at every Mexican immigrant as a potential rapist. His inaugural address talked about impending “carnage.” His political success depends on people obsessing over exaggerated or non-existent threats. What people should have been focused on was the threat that Trump presented to our nation and the world.
That’s pretty clear now, but he’s still the president and he’s still doing everything he can to make people feel uncomfortable. Now he’s hyping a new exaggerated threat by attacking vote-by-mail. More than that, he’s even suggesting that he might try to delay the election.
The country can’t handle more stress, but Trump is unrelenting. Under his leadership, literally nothing works anymore. The Department of Justice is hopelessly corrupted. The Department of Homeland Security is acting like the Gestapo. Cabinet officials are no longer confirmed by the Senate, but work in an acting or interim capacity. Our alliances are in tatters. Science takes a backseat to partisanship and ideology.
The promise of Joe Biden is not so much what he will do, but what he won’t do. He won’t stress us out unnecessarily. He won’t deliberately corrupt and break our institutions. He won’t thoughtlessly alienate our friends and do the bidding of our enemies.
The people are so thirsty for this because they are exhausted by Trump. This is also why Trump has no easy way back into contention. The things that work for him put people under stress, which is exactly what they do not want. We’d toss George Washington out of office if we thought we could wake up tomorrow and put our kids on a school bus without worrying about COVID-19.
Joe Biden isn’t that kind of magician, but he can ease our anxiety simply by being himself and not being Trump, and that’s his biggest advantage in this election.

But at the same time, there have also been reports of some companies abusing the Paycheck Protection Program — and the office of the Small Business Administration’s inspector general, according to Business Insider’s Graham Rapier, has found likely examples of PPP-related fraud.
Passed by Congress earlier this year as part of the CARES Act, the PPP was designed to make it easier for businesses to keep employees on their payrolls and avoid laying them off. Rapier reports that the IG, in a preliminary review of the PPP, found “strong indicators of widespread fraud.”
“Specifically, its investigation into hundreds of hotline complaints found $250 million in loans and grants to ‘potentially ineligible recipients’ and another $45.6 million in potential double payments,” according to Rapier. “In total, the potential wrongdoing totals less than 1% of the program’s total $520 billion in loans provided to about 5.03 million businesses since March.”
One egregious example cited by Rapier involves “a Florida man accused of spending part of a $3.9 million PPP loan on a $318,000 Lamborghini Huracan.”
In its report to the SBA, the IG’s office advised: “Swift management action could reduce or prevent additional losses to the taxpayer because the associated economic injury loan applications may still be unapproved or undisbursed. Management should engage financial institutions immediately to identify disbursements that may have been obtained fraudulently and recover disbursed funds.”
Jovita Carranza, SBA administrator, responded to the IG’s findings and stressed that the agenda is taking steps to combat PPP-related fraud.
According to Carranza, “SBA has imposed rigorous system rules and controls to mitigate the risk of fraud. Despite the lowered guardrails required by Congress with respect to fraud prevention — e.g., applicant self-certification of eligibility — and contrary to OIG’s assertions, SBA’s efforts have, in fact, saved taxpayers billions of dollars.”

John Lewis. Instead of showing the usual reserve and hesitancy to criticize that has characterized most of his post-presidency, Obama took inspiration from the fallen civil rights hero and aimed his fury specifically at the myriad abuses of the Trump administration and the Republican Party on American freedoms and fair elections.
“George Wallace may be gone, but we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators,” he said, drawing cheers and applause from the attendees. “We may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar to cast a ballot, but even as we sit here, there are those in power doing their darndest to discourage people from voting, by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision. Even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that’s going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don’t get sick!”
For those who might criticize such direct denunciations of the GOP and the president’s actions at a memorial service, Obama had a brilliant prepared response.
He explained: “Now I know this is a celebration of John’s life. Ther are some who might say we shouldn’t dwell on such things. But that’s why I’m talking about it. John Lewis devoted his time on this Earth fighting the very attacks on democracy and what’s best in America that we’re seeing circulating right now.”
He also denounced the Supreme Court’s decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act, a law that he noted was signed by two previous Republican presidents. And he called out those politicians who gave lip-service to Lewis after his death but have done nothing to support the causes for which he lived.
“If politicians want to honor John — and I’m so grateful for the legacy and work of all the congressional leaders who are here — but there’s a better way than a statement calling him a hero. You want to honor John? Let’s honor him but revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for,” Obama said.
Perhaps most strikingly, Obama endorsed bold actions to restore voting rights, including — if necessary — abolishing the Senate filibuster, which he called a “Jim Crow relic.”
“Like John, we’ve got to fight even harder for the most powerful tool that we have, which is the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act is one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. That’s why John crossed that bridge. It’s why he spilled his blood,” he said. He concluded: “What a gift John Lewis was. We are all so lucky to have had him walk with us for a while, and show us the way. God bless you all. God bless America. God bless this gentle soul who pulled it closer to its promise. Thank you very much.”

Kim Reynolds, urging her to mandate a public mask requirement as cases of the novel coronavirus continue to rise, as reported by The Gazette. The letter encourages the governor to mandate mask or other face coverings statewide and suggests that, as a bare minimum, masks should be required for adults and older children who can “medically tolerate” them when in “enclosed public spaces.” Reynolds has not yet issued a mask mandate for the entire state and instead directed Iowans to take personal responsibility on the subject.
The letter was sent to the governor on Wednesday and is available to be read on a website called A Prescription for Iowa. The letter refers to the worrisome COVID-19 surges in other states across the country, and argues that “more can be done through state public health policy to help prevent Iowa from suffering the same fate.”
Dr. Austin Baeth, the organizer of the group, stressed in a statement: “This is about using science to protect the lives of our patients, friends and family in Iowa. This is not about politics.”
It’s disturbing that a public health issue ever became partisan, but as evident in the recent Daily Kos/Civiqs polling data, mask-wearing does seem to fall across political lines. According to recent polling, 82% of Democrats say they wear face masks whenever they go out, while just over one-quarter of Republicans report the same. That said, a majority of polled American adults (54%) do believe that wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of the virus.
We know that physicians—as well as other healthcare professionals, including nurses, aides, janitors, cafeteria workers, and so on—have faced a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). We also know that medical professionals have died after working on the front lines of the virus themselves; for example, Daily Kos just covered the death of an ICU physician in Baltimore, Maryland, who died after treating COVID-19 patients himself. Not long before that, a physician who delayed his retirement to help fight the virus at a Brooklyn, New York hospital, died after contracting the virus himself. Some medical professionals, like an ICU nurse in St. Petersburg, Florida, have quit, saying coworkers were getting sick and they lacked enough adequate PPE.
At this point, Iowa is one of the few states left without a public mask mandate. But in a public health crisis, consistency cannot be overstressed.

And the South Florida Sun Sentinel, in an editorial published on July 29, pleads with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to do more to combat the health emergency Floridians are facing.
“With each passing day, COVID-19 continues to careen out of control in Florida,” the Sun Sentinel’s editorial board warns. “A record 216 deaths were reported Wednesday (July 29). That broke the previous record of 191 deaths, reported just Tuesday.”
DeSantis, a far-right ally of President Donald Trump, has drawn widespread criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic — from being much too fast to reopen non-essential businesses in his state to not doing more to encourage Floridians to wear protective face masks. In its editorial, the Sun Sentinel tells DeSantis, “Help us all out. Far better that you require people to wear masks in public than to continue fostering conditions that will force another shutdown. Your refusal to impose a mask order — a requirement now in effect in 32 other states — is out-of-touch with the mainstream. A new Quinnipiac poll found 79% of Floridians support a mask requirement, including 60% of Republicans. If that’s not a mandate, what is?”
According to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, the worldwide death count from coronavirus had reached 668,500 as of early Thursday afternoon, July 30 — and that included more than 151,000 deaths in the U.S., where some states are seriously concerned about people coming in from Florida.
The Sun Sentinel explains, “At least 12 states have singled out Floridians for 14-day quarantines should we dare to fly north to escape the heat and whatever lurks in the air. Who can blame them? Florida now boasts the second highest number of cases per 100,000 people, with 2008. That’s more than New York, at 1690; Illinois, 1365; Texas, 1345; and California, 1164. Florida is second only to New Jersey with 2018.”
The publication concludes its editorial by urging DeSantis to do a lot more to encourage the use of face masks.
“A lot has been learned about the coronavirus over the course of these five long months, including this: when it comes to masks, asking nicely doesn’t always work,” the Sentinel tells DeSantis. “The science is clear: face coverings reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus and can save lives. Issue a mask mandate, governor. If you can wear one in public, so can we all.”

Now, more than two months later, persistent inaction by the Republican-controlled Senate has pushed 30 million Americans to the brink of a steep financial cliff as federally enhanced unemployment benefits are set to lapse in just 24 hours barring a last-minute deal in Congress that appears all but impossible.
In recent weeks, McConnell justified delaying passage of another stimulus bill on the grounds that state reopenings could jumpstart the U.S. economy, rendering another relief package unnecessary.
But that prediction has not borne out; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Wednesday that the “pace of recovery looks like it has slowed.”
“There’s probably going to be a long tail where a large number of people are struggling to get back to work,” Powell said as coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to surge across the nation, forcing states to pause their nascent reopenings.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department announced that the U.S. economy shrank at a record-shattering 32.9% annual rate last quarter. New Labor Department numbers also out Thursday showed that 1.43 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the total number of people in the U.S. who are either receiving unemployment insurance (UI) or waiting for approval to more than 33 million.
“The policy response to this should be clear,” Josh Bivens, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, wrote in a blog post Thursday. “Congress and the president need to restore the extra $600 in unemployment insurance so long as the job market remains damaged, and needs to provide large-scale, flexible aid to state and local governments to keep the coming revenue shortfalls facing these governments from translating into spending cuts and austerity.”
Economist Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, called the new Commerce Department numbers the “ugliest GDP report any of us have ever seen.”
“Really sorry for yelling at you at 8:46 am,” Bernstein added in an all-caps tweet, “but vital, enhanced UI benefits expire tomorrow because congressional Republicans failed to extend them. ‘Malpractice’ is far too weak a word for this epic, cruel failure.”
It remains to be seen whether the ominous new economic figures will spur congressional negotiators to reach a deal to prevent the federal unemployment lifeline from lapsing for at least a week, causing a massive drop in income for tens of millions of people.
“We are nowhere close to a deal,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Wednesday after leaving a meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).
The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, estimated this week that the GOP plan to reduce the federal UI boost to $200 per week would cut total weekly unemployment payments “from a national average of $920.68 per week to $520.68 per week.”
“If enacted, the proposal would have devastating consequences for American families, businesses, and the economy,” wrote Century Foundation senior fellow Andrew Stettner.
Compounding the pain of the likely benefit lapse is the fact that another rent payment is due for many Americans in just two days. Last Friday, as Common Dreams reported, a federal moratorium on evictions expired, leaving the more than 12 million people in the U.S. who live in homes with federally backed mortgages vulnerable to being forced onto the streets.
“Rent is due this week. Unemployment benefits expire this week. The eviction moratorium is gone,” tweeted Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Congress can—and must—prevent this catastrophe.”
After refusing to put forth his own plan for months and blocking House Democrats’ proposal to extend the $600-per-week unemployment payments through January of next year, McConnell on Wednesday attempted to blame Pelosi for the coming lapse in benefits—a narrative Democrats immediately rejected.
“Let’s get a few things clear: This is happening because when House Democrats passed an extension 10 weeks ago Senate Republicans said they needed a ‘pause,'” tweeted Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.). “Then they didn’t do a single thing until it was too late. Then they introduced a bill that is terrible, stupid, and unworkable. Even the Republicans hate their own bill, there is nearly universal agreement that it is bad policy.”
“The Republicans are playing with the lives of 30 million people,” Beyer added, “not to mention the recovery of the entire U.S. economy.”

But this week, Trump floated the idea of doing exactly that — claiming that voter fraud is a genuine threat and implying that perhaps the election could be postponed in order to make sure that Americans can “properly, securely and safely” vote.
Trump tweeted:
With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???

CNN’s Manu Raju, in a Twitter thread, posted some reactions from GOP senators:
Sen. Lindsey Graham told me this morning about Trump’s call to delay the election: “I don’t think that’s a particularly good idea.” He declined further comment.
“Not answering any questions,” said Sen. Joni Ernst, who is in a tough race, when I asked about Trump’s tweet.

Sen. Mitt Romney defended mail-in voting, saying it works “extremely well. The great thing about it is that you have a paper document that if you need to do a recount you don’t have to worry about machines having been tampered with.”

Sen. Ted Cruz said: “Election fraud is a serious problem we need to stop it and fight it, but no the election should not be delayed.”

“The election is going to be held in November. Absentee ballots in North Carolina are strongly encouraged, as has the president encouraged them.“

Earlier that day, TPUSA had posted a tweet mocking “leftists” for wearing face masks — and that tweet, according to Business Insider’s Tom Porter, was deleted following Montgomery’s death.
TPUSA, sadly, has a history of downplaying the importance of social distancing measures and ridiculing the use of face masks. In a tweet posted on July 22 — less than a week before Montgomery’s death — TPUSA tweeted a sign that read, “Imagine if everyone wearing a mask was carrying a copy of the Constitution instead” (as if trying to avoid getting sick with COVID-19 and possibly dying from it somehow limits one’s ability to defend the Constitution).
In a March 22 op-ed for Fox News’ website, Kirk acknowledged how dangerous COVID-19 is and encouraged young adults to be careful. However, Kirk has been critical of local governments that have mandated face masks in public places; on his podcast, Kirk recently declared, “Do not force me to wear a mask — it’s that simple. I’m not gonna do it, I’m not.”

Susan Collins, R-Maine, insisted that her politics have not “changed” after the Lincoln Project launched a $1 million ad campaign accusing her for abandoning her independence in deference to President Donald Trump.
Collins has long touted her moderate credentials during her 23-year Senate career but has seen her support among Mainers plummet after her votes to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and to acquit Trump during the impeachment trial. Collins had long been a popular senator among her state’s voters, boasting a 67% approval rating when Trump took office. That number has fallen to just 36% in recent polls, and she was ranked the most unpopular senator in the country earlier this year.
Collins is one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans up for re-election. The race has drawn a massive amount of outside spending, including a new $1 million ad campaign launched by the conservative anti-Trump group The Lincoln Project, which accuses her of becoming a “Trump stooge” since the president took office. Collins refuted that criticism in a campaign video posted to Twitter.
“My opponents say I’ve changed. I haven’t, but politics sure has,” Collins said. “The non-stop false attacks against me began more than a year ago. Especially offensive are the outrageous attacks on my integrity.”
After touting that she has not missed a single roll call vote in the Senate, Collins vowed that she “will not back down from doing what I believe is right for Maine.”
The ad was released on the same day that the Lincoln Project, which was co-founded by George Conway, the husband of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, and Steve Schmidt, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., entered the Maine race with an ad taking aim at Collins’ moderate credentials.
The Lincoln Project ad begins by touting former Maine Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, who “called out” former Sen. Joseph McCarthy for smearing his opponents as communists during his Cold War crusade.
“Just like Susan Collins stands up to Donald Trump,” the narrator says. “Oh wait, Susan Collins never stands up to Donald Trump.”
“That’s why Maine is done with her weakness and excuses,” the ad continues. “Collins isn’t an independent — she’s a fraud. Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump control her voice. She makes excuses for corruption, for criminality, for cruelty, all while pretending she’s worried, concerned.”
While playing a montage of McConnell and Trump administration officials, the ad goes on to claim that “Collins doesn’t work for Maine — she works for them.”
“Maine deserves a leader — not a Trump stooge,” the ad concludes. “It’s time for Susan Collins to go.”
The ad is part of a larger Lincoln Project $4 million ad buy targeting other vulnerable Republicans in states like Alaska and Montana, Axios reported.
Collins has received plenty of outside help herself from groups like the Federalist Society, which helped bankroll Kavanaugh’s nomination. But she has been massively outraised by her Democratic opponent, Maine Speaker of the House Sara Gideon.
A new Colby College poll released Tuesday showed Gideon leading Collins by five points. To put the numbers into perspective, Collins won her previous re-election race by about 37 points. Collins has seen her approval rating among women drop to just 39% while her approval rating among voters under 35 has fallen to just 24%. Roughly as many voters said they are voting against Collins as those who said they are voting to support Gideon.
The poll also shows Trump trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden by 11 points in the state. The president’s approval rating in the state is only 39%.
“Moderation has been key to the senator’s image for more than two decades,” Colby College professor Dan Shea, who conducted the poll, said. “If that perception is gone, voters will fall back on their partisanship or attitudes toward the top of the ticket. When combined with the President’s low approval rating across the state, that spells trouble for Susan.”

0,2020-07-30T14:38:09+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/herman-cain-from-at-74/,Herman Cain dead from coronavirus at 74,"Herman Cain’s website has announced that the Republican activist and former Godfather’s Pizza CEO has died from COVID-19 at the age of 74.
Conservative Dan Calabrese posted, “Herman Cain — our boss, our friend, like a father to so many of us — has passed away. He’s entering the presence of the Savior he’s served as an associate minister at Antioch Baptist Church in Atlanta for, and preparing for his reward.”
Calabrese went on to say, “Let me deal with some of the particulars of the last few weeks. We knew when he was first hospitalized with COVID-19 that this was going to be a rough fight. He had trouble breathing and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. We all prayed that the initial meds they gave him would get his breathing back to normal, but it became clear pretty quickly that he was in for a battle.”
The news that Cain, who served as co-chairman of Black Voices for Trump, had been hospitalized because of COVID-19 was widely reported in early July. Cain tested positive on June 29 and was hospitalized on July 2.
Updates on his condition were given via his Twitter account, @TheHermanCain; earlier this week on Monday, July 27, a tweet read, “We know it’s been a few days since we last gave you an update on the boss. But he is still in the hospital being treated with oxygen for his lungs. In the meantime, the doctors say his other organs and systems are strong.”
It is unclear where Cain was infected with COVID-19, but many pundits have noted that when he attended President Donald Trump’s Tulsa rally on June 20, he was seen not wearing a face mask.
Cain was among the Republicans who competed with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, now a U.S. Senator in Utah, in the GOP’s 2012 presidential primary. Ultimately, Romney won the nomination but lost to incumbent President Barack Obama in the general election.

Stirewalt said that while there’s a good chance Trump was just trying to stir the pot, the potential delaying of an election would be “out of step” with all of Trump’s predecessors, and frankly, “a flagrant expression of his current weakness.”
“A person who is in a strong position would never, never make a suggestion like that,” he said.

0,2020-07-30T13:54:24+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/there-is-something-to-learn-from-texas-but-its-not-what-fox-news-wants-you-to-believe/,There is something to learn from Texas — but it’s not what Fox News wants you to believe,"On Wednesday evening, Fox News person Laura Ingraham issued a tweet bragging that Texas was “looking pretty good” and sneering that this is “Bad news for the ‘Shut it all Down’ Democrats.” And then, with perfect timing, Texas announced another 9,200 new cases of COVID-19 and a record-shattering 313 deaths. Which isn’t exactly evidence that it’s time to throw a party in Texas.
Still … there’s actually a kernel of truth behind Ingraham’s post. It’s not that Texas is doing “good,” and the still-rising numbers of recorded deaths is a gut-punch. However, the rate of growth has slowed in Texas. It’s just that it’s slowed for a reason that Ingraham, Fox, or Trump are not going to mention—for a name that Democrats fully support.
Here’s Ingraham’s original tweet, which shows just how ridiculous the “looking good” comment really is.

But here’s the same data with something else in the picture.
What can be seen in this image is something that happened on July 2. That’s when Governor Greg Abbott, facing a rising tide of cases, abruptly reversed himself and issued a mask mandate for the majority of Texas counties. That action didn’t have immediate effect, because the virus takes some time to be transmitted from person to person, and days more for symptoms to appear. However, just ten days after that order went into effect, the 7-day trend line of cases in Texas leveled off. Two weeks after that order went into effect, the number of new cases began to drop.
There are definitely problems with enforcement in some counties, and Abbott’s order could be simpler and less easily waved away with “exceptions,” but Texas appears to demonstrate, once again, that masks work.
What’s the evidence that masks have something to do with what’s happening in Texas and not some mystical effect of hitting a magic percentage of the population? Florida. That’s the evidence. Until the mask order went into place, the trends in the two southern states was remarkably similar.
On the day that Abbott issued the mask mandate, the difference in the total number of cases in Florida and Texas was less than 7000. For the next week, the two states went up in tandem. Then … Florida began to edge ahead. From a 4,000 case gap on July 11, Florida moved ahead by over 47,000 cases on July 28. Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis has stubbornly refused to take any definitive action, is paying a price in tens of thousands of cases. Those cases will turn into hundreds of deaths.
If Abbott continues the mask mandate, and counties step up enforcement, it’s likely that in another month things in Texas will look better. Not “good” as Ingraham would have it, but better. Better as in a sharp reduction in new cases, an ease in overcrowded hospitals, and a drop in the indicator that always lags behind the others — deaths.
In the meantime, Florida’s numbers are about to start looking a whole lot better without a mask mandate. Because the state testing authority has announced that, with the tropical storm about to strike the state, testing is going to be suspended for at least five days.
Just enough time for DeSantis to run a quick victory lap.

One addition note: It’s now clear that Texas, like Florida, has been under reporting COVID-19 deaths. The scheme in both states appears to involve overlooking the rulings made by county officials and failing to incorporate deaths into the state-wide reporting. How Texas will handle these previously unreported deaths is not yet clear.

Louie Gohmert, who tested positive for COVID-19 this week and, according to Politico’s Jake Sherman, repeatedly “berated” staffers for trying to protect themselves by wearing a mask.
The far-right Texas congressman has been highly critical of wearing face masks, which countless medical experts have stressed can slow down the spread of coronavirus. And Gohmert isn’t unique in that regard: after the media reported that Gohmert had COVID-19, Sherman said he received a “flood” of e-mails from GOP staffers who complained that they were being berated for wearing face masks.
Sherman received an e-mail from a Gohmert staffer that read, “Jake, thank you for letting our office know Louie tested positive for the Coronavirus. When you write your story, can you include the fact that Louie requires full staff to be in the office, including three interns, so that ‘we could be an example to America on how to open up safely.’ When probing the office, you might want to ask how often were people (were) berated for wearing masks.”
After tweeting that text, reporter Jerry Lambe notes in Law & Crime, Sherman reported that he had “gotten a flood of e-mails from Republican staffers who say they too are being forced to come to the Hill without a mask now.”
But Gohmert, instead of having the decency to acknowledge that his critics were right about the benefits of wearing a face mask, doubled down on his idiocy and even went so far as to say that perhaps wearing a mask was the thing that caused him to be infected with COVID-19. Gohmert argued, “I can’t help but wonder if by keeping a mask on — keeping it in place — if I might’ve got some germ, some of the virus, on the mask and breathed it in.”
On July 22, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, issued an executive order making face masks mandatory in a variety of public situations, ranging from offices to stores to hotel lobbies. But employees of the federal government are exempt from the order while working, and that includes Trump as well as members of Congress such as Gohmert.

John Lewis in final message: ‘In the last days and hours of my life you inspired me’,"The coronavirus pandemic prevented Rep. John Lewis from having the big public funeral someone of his stature might ordinarily get, a national occasion for mourning together. But as Lewis is laid to rest on Thursday at 11 AM ET, you can stream the service on CBSN, and he left us with some final words, to be printed in The New York Times on the day of his funeral.
“While my time here has now come to an end,” Lewis wrote, “I want you to know that in the last days and hours of my life you inspired me. You filled me with hope about the next chapter of the great American story when you used your power to make a difference in our society. Millions of people motivated simply by human compassion laid down the burdens of division. Around the country and the world you set aside race, class, age, language and nationality to demand respect for human dignity.”
Lewis went on to link the racist oppression of his childhood to events today, writing that “Emmett Till was my George Floyd. He was my Rayshard Brooks, Sandra Bland and Breonna Taylor.” He urged people to continue getting in the “good trouble, necessary trouble” he had so long championed, but not to forget that “The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.”
”When historians pick up their pens to write the story of the 21st century,” Lewis closed, “let them say that it was your generation who laid down the heavy burdens of hate at last and that peace finally triumphed over violence, aggression and war. So I say to you, walk with the wind, brothers and sisters, and let the spirit of peace and the power of everlasting love be your guide.”
Although Lewis’ funeral will be a small, invitation-only event at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush will all be in attendance. Obama is expected to eulogize Lewis, while Clinton and Bush will participate in the service. Donald Trump, of course, did not travel from the White House to the Capitol to pay his respects as Lewis lay in state there.

0,2020-07-30T13:16:27+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/theres-a-reason-why-republicans-are-pushing-hydroxychloroquine-again-and-its-ugly/,There’s a reason why Republicans are pushing hydroxychloroquine again — and it’s ugly,"On Wednesday morning, Republicans are in the second day of a full-on blitz attempting to sell the idea that hydroxychloroquine is effective as a treatment against COVID-19. That effort comes in the form of not just statements from Donald Trump, but supporting tweets and emails from Republican candidates and a full-court press from Fox News. At first, the idea that the GOP is latching onto claims from a doctor who believes medicines come from alien DNA to justify renewed support for a drug proven ineffective months ago seems baffling. Even if everyone from Ron DeSantis to Peter Navarro has joined in buying hundreds of millions of pointless doses, and they have, the billions wasted on the drug hardly seem to justify a second round of life-threatening propaganda.
But the hydroxychloroquine story isn’t about whether or not the drug is effective—and to be clear, it’s not. The reason Republicans are supporting this fresh round of out-and-out lies about a treatment that is more harmful than helpful isn’t because they’re getting rich off the pills. It’s because they really, really need to convince people that it’s safe to go back to work and send their kids back to school. Because hydroxychloroquine, schools reopening, and the GOP “plan” for COVID-19 are all a single story. It’s the story of Republicans needing working class people to go out there and generate money—for the wealthy.
On Monday, Republicans finally produced a draft of their take on the next round of addressing COVID-19—a round that, though a third the size of what’s needed at this point, is still much larger than the entire economic stimulus program that Barack Obama fought for and signed in 2009. The Republican plan not only cuts unemployment compensation for those unable to work because of the pandemic, it sweeps in $30 billion for critical pandemic items like more F-35 fighters and a new FBI building. It took that kind of “sweetening” to get enough Republicans to agree to having any plan at all.
But there are two things that Republicans were dead set on getting into their package. Two things that Sen.  Mitch McConnell and others made clear were absolutely a requirement before the Senate would lift a finger. The Republican plan had to:
Ensure that it cut unemployment benefits to workers sent home by business closures during the pandemic.
Protect corporations from being sued by workers who caught COVID-19 from being forced to work in unsafe conditions.
These were not a secret agenda. These were McConnell’s openly stated goals. He has been pushing for weeks the idea that, unless corporations are given a free pass to get as many workers sick as they like, America would be “swamped by personal injury lawsuits,” just because people had been personally injured. Republicans aren’t hiding this. Their entire agenda when it comes to COVID-19 is making sure that people have no choice but to get out there and put their lives on the line for minimum wage. Trump even used an executive order to put mostly immigrant workers back onto the lines at meatpacking facilities even as people at those facilities were literally dying.
And that’s exactly why Republicans are also keen on reopening schools. Those complaining about people not being eager to work for minimum wage in the midst of a pandemic and those calling for the reopening of public schools are after the same thing: Maintaining a low-cost “service class” that does the actual work while the wealthy and corporations collect the benefit of their labor. It’s not anything new. It’s actually baked into the unfettered capitalism of the American system. The COVID-19 crisis only serves to underline the utter cruelty and inhumanity intrinsic to that system.
The public school funding system in the United States—where almost all the cost falls on property tax in local communities—is one of the best tools the wealthy have ever created to externalize costs and ensure the continued presence of a low-cost worker class. The result of the current system of school funding is that poor communities end up paying a much higher tax rate, while still getting schools that provide inadequate opportunities for their children, helping to lock in a poverty cycle. This is by no means an accident.
Across the nation, private schools are not opening. Barron Trump’s school is not opening. But Republicans want public schools open for the same reason they want unemployment benefits ended: the working class is the engine that puts more money in wealthy pockets. Reopening public schools in the midst of a pandemic has nothing to do with educating the nation’s children. It has everything to do with removing obstacles that keep the cogs from getting back out there and turning the wheels of commerce.
Cutting unemployment and opening schools is entirely designed to give American workers absolutely no choice but to put their lives on the line without making a single demand on their employers. That’s what Republicans are saying every time they complain about the chance that someone might possibly be able to survive for another month on unemployment benefits. Other nations are absolutely providing workers with enhanced benefits during the pandemic because “paying people to stay home” is good public policy. It’s impossible to have effective social distancing if workers are being put in a position where they cannot stay home, and cannot disobey directives from their employers, even if those directives are unsafe.
Hydroxychloroquine is just the carrot being dangled in front of workers as they’re forced back on the job, and their children are forced back into school without an option. It’s the promise that if they do get sick, there’s something that can be done about it. Unfortunately, it’s also an absolute lie.

“With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,” the president wrote. “It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???”
The president at the moment is badly trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in election polls, due in large part to dissatisfaction with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which so far has killed more than 150,000 Americans in just five months.
Even if Trump wanted to delay the election, however, it’s not clear how he could do so without an act of Congress, as the current federal law mandates that the election be held on the first Tuesday after November 1st.

0,2020-07-30T12:59:04+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/this-is-one-total-failure-by-donald-trump-that-is-actually-good-for-the-united-states/,This is one total failure by Donald Trump that is actually good for the United States,"To say that in 2019 America produced less coal than it has in any year since 1978 is telling only part of the story. Because in 1978 coal mines across the country were engaged in a national miner’s strike—one in which the President Jimmy Carter was definitely on the wrong side of history in attempting to force miners back on the job through the courts. Ultimately, though the miners technically won in terms of getting what they wanted, they lost because the strike accelerated the focus of mining companies into western coal fields where they would eventually break the union by shutting out union miners from large new surface mines while idling smaller mines in the east.
But there was no miner’s strike in 2019. There was also no coronavirus pandemic, because that didn’t become a problem until after the first of the year. What the latest numbers from the Energy Information Administration show is an industry in rapid decline. A minor increase in 2017 has proven to be unsustainable, despite Donald Trump throwing the industry every possible assistance. Coal production declined 7% in 2019. And the data available so far shows that 2020 will be even worse for an industry that’s vanishing faster than anyone would have believed possible a decade ago. Electricity generated by coal in the U.S. fell to a 42-year low in 2019, decreasing over 15% in a single year. Since then it has fallen an amazing 34% in the last five months. That’s not 34% total, it’s 34% on top of the 15% decline last year.
The Powder River Basin in Wyoming continues to be the nation’s largest source of coal, producing almost 40% of the nation’s product. In Wyoming, a pair of huge mines there—one from Arch, the other from Peabody—together making up the majority of the state’s production. But the fact that those two companies, the nation’s largest coal companies and long-time fierce competitors, had to team up in the last year in an effort to reduce costs and retain control of a shrinking market shows how tenuous the industry has become. Production in Wyoming was down by 9% in 2019. What was once a steady stream of coal trains coming out of the Powder River Basin has become an increasingly ragged flow; one that is threatening to fall to a trickle in 2020.
Meanwhile, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission has voted to close the last coal-powered generating facility in the whole Four Corners region. The decision is an easy one, because even though replacing the coal plant with 100% renewable power will require a $1 billion investment, it will actually save ratepayers in the region more than $6 per month, while creating 1,000 construction jobs. That’s because at this point building new solar and wind facilities is actually cheaper than simply maintaining existing coal plants. That kind of economics is why New Mexico isn’t alone actually being ahead of targets to move to renewable power.
The New Mexico decision follows just months after Arizona closed the Navajo Generating Station at Page, Arizona. That plant was the last coal-fired plant in the state, and it was fed by the state’s last coal mine. Now both are gone. Instead, visitors to the Navajo Nation will find a huge new solar facility that produces power for 13,000 homes.
Even in states long associated with coal production, the plants are closing. At what was once the largest coal powered generating plant in the world, Paradise Steam Plant in western Kentucky, the last of three huge turbines has made the switch to natural gas. That switch means that Paradise will still produce greenhouse gases, but it will no longer generate millions of tons of coal ash for the surrounding communities, or throw out a plume of both mercury and uranium that reaches a thousand miles to the sea.
The declining cost of renewables also means that what coal companies once viewed as the industry’s savior—exported coal—is also in decline. Coal exports were actually down 29% in the first five months of 2020. Companies have actually dropped several of the efforts to build export facilities as overseas markets evaporate even faster than those in the United States.
The industry crash also means that the efforts to save coal through “next generation” plants has completely crumbled. It’s been almost three years since what was supposed to be the nation’s first “clean coal” plant announced that it would not burn coal at all, ending a $6 billion experiment in failure. And on Tuesday, the only remaining commercial scale clean coal project in the United States was cancelled. As Oilprice.com reports, Petra Nova, which was supposed to capture carbon dioxide from a coal-fired power plant near Houston, has been “mothballed.” There is another project out there—North Dakota’s “Project Tundra”—but it exists only on paper and is unlikely to ever move forward.
As with many industries, coal mining employment has fallen sharply during the pandemic, but even before COVID-19 made the news, mining jobs were already in a steep decline.
Back in 2017, as he was signing an order scrapping regulations and allowing coal companies to openly bribe foreign governments, The Washington Post reported on his ecstatic support for coal. “We’re bringing back jobs, big league,” said Trump. “We’re bringing them back at the plant level. We’re bringing them back at the mine level. The energy jobs are coming back.”
None of that happened. The plants are gone. The mines are gone. The industry is going. Despite everything he did to make coal profitable and everything he’s done to stand in the way of renewable energy, Donald Trump has utterly failed. And this is one failure we should all be applauding.

It is this combination of psychopathology that leads him to be intensely attracted to the powers of a dictator. Indeed, Trump has proven repeatedly that he wants America to be an autocracy, not a democracy. He has systemically and purposefully guided our country toward dictatorial rule during the past four years. He has frequently embraced, admired, complimented, envied and even fawned over autocratic leaders throughout the world.
Donald Trump in a second term would be unstoppable. And America might be changed forever.
Trump seeks complete power and control. According to him, the president has absolute, all-encompassing authority. As such, Trump does not abide by norms or rules. He breaks laws with impunity. He interferes with all attempts at oversight and accountability. He believes that he is free to exert his power as he sees fit, no matter the motivation or legality or well-being of anyone other than Donald Trump.
Despite taking the presidential oath, Trump exhibits no intention to uphold or defend our Constitution. He does not recognize that the three branches of government are co-equal. He has demonstrated his belief that the executive branch holds all power. Look at how he has politicized the Department of Justice; he has been able to get investigations of himself and his cronies stopped. Branches of government in a dictatorship exist solely for the benefit and pleasure of the leader. Trump treats our judicial branch as an extension of himself, and as a vehicle for obtaining power and hiding his corruption.
Trump does not believe in the value of the free press because its function is antithetical to his needs and wishes. His constant proclamation of “fake news” is his way of trying to undermine and even destroy the credibility of the free press. Trump asserts that he has the right to jail journalists. He tries to portray journalists as “the enemy of the people,” even though their role is to serve as a watchdog of government and to inform the citizenry. In a similar vein, Trump believes he has the right to jail political rivals. He sees them as his mortal “enemies” because they have the audacity to compete against him or to speak out in opposition. He seeks to exact sadistic vengeance on his political rivals in order to destroy them and to enhance his power.
For Trump, gaslighting the American public is real, while facts and information are “fake.” Reality for Trump is not defined by data or rationality but by his own needs and wants. To reach his goal of control and power, Trump is more than comfortable with his lies, misinformation, conspiracy theories, magical thinking, scapegoating, denials and rambling blather.
Trump has just begun a strategy of provoking peaceful protesters so that he can exert his absolute and even cruel authority. Trump engages in “stochastic terrorism” by saying just enough to trigger vulnerable people to act out in anger while he maintains a thin veneer of deniability. Now Trump is sending federal troops into American cities to escalate conflicts with protesters in order to demonstrate his raw sadistic strength. While claiming he is our “Law and Order” president, Trump is lawless and shameless himself. That is the twisted irony of a dictator.
Trump shows no empathy for others. He has an unquenchable desire for praise and adulation, but he is incapable of understanding human pain and suffering and plight. All but a very few of his personal alliances are fleeting and transactional. Trump treats others as dupes to be influenced and then dismissed at will when they are no longer of service to him.
Trump’s lack of empathy is not just a matter of theory or abstraction. His complete denial and inaction in response to the current deadly pandemic is reflective of his thinly-veiled solipsism and sadism. He has been an active accomplice to the mass murder of more than 150,000 Americans, with the numbers growing every day, and it is but a minor inconvenience to him if it serves his personal or political goals. Sadly, American deaths are palatable to him if they somehow set the stage for his re-election.
Trump’s authoritarianism explains his attraction to other authoritarian leaders around the world, especially Vladimir Putin. His admiration of Putin is openly expressed. He is envious of Putin’s strength and boldness and lack of conscience. He wants to be like Putin; he wants absolute power and he wants to be adored but feared by the people. Yet paradoxically, Trump is so in awe of Putin and other autocrats, that he presents himself as subservient and inept, as he did in Helsinki and North Korea.
Trump’s mode of governing has been to stoke division, confusion and chaos. An America in crisis is exactly what Trump desires since it then becomes easier for him to exert control and power, to profit from corruption, and to wreak vengeance on his foes.
Trump views the presidency as a way of marketing his brand and of skimming profits. Making money, for him, is an end in itself. Trump has not abided by the emoluments clause of the Constitution. His golf properties and Washington hotel have made huge profits off the public payroll and from foreign dignitaries. Trump’s claim that he has lost money by assuming the presidency is a lie and part of his scam. Even money from his Inaugural fund in 2016 has been skimmed off by family members.
Finally, Trump is anti-science and anti-intellectualism in his approach to governance. Why? Because he believes that his ideas, his notions, his hunches and his narratives are far superior to data and knowledge. In other words, he does not want facts and information to interfere with his wishes and desires, either personal and political. Trump does not care if you believe the world is flat if it embellishes him or profits him.
If re-elected, Trump will feel empowered and emboldened to march the country toward dictatorial rule. If Republicans continue in their complicity, Trump’s dictatorial strivings will not be stopped. And, sadly, Trump’s Attorney General, William Barr, will clear the path for him in his quest for an authoritarian presidency.
Trump is unfit to be president. He represents a clear and present danger to our democratic way of life. The psychopathology that underlies and fuels his wish to be an authoritarian dictator is severely malignant.
Will a new America be transformed in Trump’s image? Will the Oval Office become the seat of a dictator?
The election on Nov. 3, 2020, may well determine the future of our democracy for decades or generations to come. Vote like your life depends upon it.
It. Does.

Jacobi Niv had paid Larry King a few thousand dollars apiece to narrate half a dozen videos for companies or projects in Israel, where King is still a big name. But what Niv wanted King to tape on March 27, 2019, wasn’t the usual infomercial. It was more like a disinfomercial.
An Israeli with designer clothes, a buzz cut and a long history of failed businesses and inflated credentials, Niv had known King for nearly a decade. King sometimes taped Niv’s promotional videos at the same Glendale, California, studio where the longtime television host filmed “Larry King Now” and “PoliticKING” for Ora Media, the digital TV network he started with his wife, Shawn. The crew resented the way Niv would stride into their homey, basic studio, bringing extra work for them. But he had ingratiated himself with King, in part by sending him lavish floral arrangements and other expensive gifts on Jewish holidays, King and others said.
That morning, Niv emailed a script to King’s executive producer, Jason Rovou, who recognized that it wasn’t Niv’s typical fare. It was about China, not Israel, and the content appeared to be news-related.
After a 300-word preamble on the U.S. trade deficit with China, King was to introduce a guest, Russian journalist Anastasia Dolgova. The first of King’s scripted questions for her was open-ended: “How can we strengthen the relationship between the 2 countries?”
It soon got more pointed. “Dolgova, you wanted to present us with a case that you mentioned on your show as well,” the script read. “There were several Chinese people who worked in China and allegedly committed crimes there who then fled to the United States and Europe, continuing on with their normal lives while leaving many angry people behind.”
Dolgova’s answers were not in the script. They were plugged in separately. King was expected to tape his questions without speaking to her. His skill at the give-and-take of interviewing, of sensing the moment and asking the right question that draws a revealing response, would not be of any use.
Rovou sensed trouble. The idea of lending the set — and his boss’s reputation — to a potentially controversial video that Ora couldn’t control disturbed him, according to three people familiar with the incident. Rovou worried that King could be helping a foreign government spread false information, reminiscent of Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election — a topic King routinely discussed with guests on “PoliticKING.”
When Niv showed up at the studio, intent on making the video, the usually laid-back Rovou confronted him. “It annoyed the holy hell out of Jason, like I’ve never seen him,” said Ian Smith, then a director at Ora. “Jason, to his face, told him how annoyed he was with him. Everyone knew he didn’t like what Larry was being asked to do.”
Niv took Rovou’s outburst in stride. “Jason didn’t want to do this video, not this video, any video,” Niv recalled. “He would say, ‘Why do you come here without telling me in advance?’ So I told him, ‘Look Jason, I set it up with Larry.’”
Rovou implored King not to do the video. King waved away his concerns. The then-85-year-old host, who was in poor health, also made it clear that shooting elsewhere — he occasionally taped Niv’s videos at a Beverly Hills hotel — would be a burden.
Defeated, the crew gathered around the chestnut-colored wood-paneled set of “Larry King Now,” an Emmy-nominated interview show that has featured more than 1,000 guests from Oprah Winfrey to Harrison Ford. Staff loaded the teleprompter and started filming. In the same white shirt, blue floral tie and black suspenders that he wore for an episode of “PoliticKING” taped that day, King ran through the monologue and the string of questions, the last being, “I’m amazed, are you sure that the story you are telling here is real and authentic?” He concluded, “We will continue to bring you interesting stories.”
Early that afternoon, Rovou emailed a link of the raw footage to Niv.
“Ora can’t do favor tapings,” Rovou wrote. “I just can’t have this dropped on me again.”
Rovou’s fears were well-founded. In the twilight of a remarkable radio and television career spanning more than six decades, battling health problems but determined to stay in the public eye, King was ensnared in an international disinformation scheme. Based on social media analysis and the retracing of a trail that wound through two Israeli entrepreneurs to Ora’s California studio, it appears that the Chinese government, possibly in concert with Russia, manipulated an American broadcasting icon.
“It’s unfortunate that Larry found himself unwittingly being exploited,” said Ora’s CEO, John Dickey. “I’ve seen it over the years. He’ll talk to anybody. He’ll give access to anybody, to a fault. He loves to mentor. He loves to be available. With a star that shines as bright as his, you’re going to have some people come into your orbit who are not positive. … This was obviously not right, and in hindsight, I wish it never would have happened. Larry didn’t know, and Jason could only protest so much.”
Posted on YouTube under the title “Larry King US China Special Conference 2019,” and quickly spread by social media accounts linked to Chinese government influence operations, the fake interview went viral across Chinese-language social media, likely reaching hundreds of thousands of users on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
As diplomatic tensions escalate between the U.S. and China, the video demonstrates how foreign disinformation campaigns are growing increasingly aggressive even as they conceal their origins to boost credibility. Social media is only one element of China’s far-ranging propaganda efforts. China also disseminates its message on university campuses, where its Confucius Institutes convey a whitewashed view of Chinese history and politics, and its Thousand Talents program aggressively woos top scientists.
The video has other implications as well. By conveying Chinese disinformation through a journalist for Russian media, it may exemplify the increasing media cooperation between the two countries. In addition, it raises questions about whether Niv — and King himself — should have registered as foreign agents on behalf of China.
“This is something that the Department of Justice would certainly be interested in, particularly given the department’s emphasis on combating Chinese influence within the United States,” said Matthew Sanderson, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who specializes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act. “Who was calling the shots and who is behind the interview?”
In the video, King appears to conduct a live interview with Dolgova, who according to her LinkedIn profile is the head of the International Department at Russian state-linked broadcaster REN TV, and used to be an editor and news analyst for the state-owned Russia-24 channel. The topic is Guo Wengui, a wealthy Chinese dissident who lives in Manhattan. Chinese authorities contend that Guo committed crimes in China, including rape and kidnapping, and they have unsuccessfully sought his deportation from the U.S.
Dolgova, who appears to be reading from a script in a home office, hits the key points of the Chinese government’s position, warning the U.S. against granting Guo political asylum: “The U.S. has really gambled with someone like him,” she says. “He’s actually fled his country from criminal felonies, such as corruption, bribery, money laundering and even sexual harassment.” Guo’s case, she adds, sends a “dangerous message. … If you are wealthy, bring your millions to America and all will be forgiven.”
When King asks, “Could such events affect the relationship between the countries, and how?” Dolgova responds, “This is all happening in the middle of a trade war truce, so peace between Washington and Beijing. We have got days to go before the truce is over and a deal is set to be struck. … Now, we have this criminal that the U.S. is protecting because he’s a poster boy for free speech even with his long criminal track record.” She sums up: “It isn’t even about U.S.-China relations anymore. It’s about doing the right thing.”
In two emails to ProPublica and two phone interviews, Niv initially maintained that the video was nothing out of the ordinary. He said that Itai Rapoport, an Israeli former journalist who runs a production company, had approached him and “asked to sign a deal where Larry was to host an online conference” about U.S.-China relations, covering the economy, immigration and history. “We started with one episode about Chinese people with influence who moved to the U.S.”
The 36-year-old Niv said he had “no idea” who Guo was. He said that Rapoport provided the script and offered Dolgova as an expert because she had researched the topic. “Larry asked her questions, like he would do in any other conference,” Niv said. “…It was a very simple conference hosting work.”
However, Niv later acknowledged having had increasing qualms about the video as it continued to circulate on social media despite his efforts, at the urging of King’s wife, to take it down. “The only time that I got suspicious that something is not right is when I kept looking at the video again and again and again,” he said. “When I removed it, it kept coming back to YouTube.”
Dolgova and Rapoport declined to comment. “Unfortunately now is not the good time,” Dolgova wrote in a Facebook message.
“Unfortunately I cannot talk about my clients,” Rapoport said. “It’s very private.”
In a telephone interview, King expressed remorse and bewilderment. He said he is not familiar with Guo or Rapoport and hasn’t watched the video. “To me, it was just a small favor for a guy who I like,” he said. “I have no idea what it was for.”
Niv, he said, “gave me some cockamamie reason” for doing the video. “It sounded like I was helping someone in need,” King said. “I never should have done it, obviously.”
He added, “I was stupid. I did what he asked me to do. But I felt sorry for him. I regret having done it, but I had no idea it got international scale. … Obviously, he used me.”
King said he occasionally tapes questions for infomercials or convention videos in advance, without conducting a live interview. While he recalls little of the circumstances of the Dolgova video, he said, Niv would have encouraged him to participate by saying that it was connected to Israel. Whenever Niv pitched him on an infomercial, King said, “it was never without Israel being mentioned, because that would appeal to my instinct as a Jew. He would say, ‘It’s going to be very helpful for us.’”
“That’s all I know. It came and went.”
ProPublica found that the Chinese government was involved in distributing the video. Our analysis of data released by Twitter showed that nearly 250 fake accounts linked to China’s government shared nearly 40 different links to the video a total of more than 500 times. Around half of those fake accounts had more than 10,000 followers.
One Facebook account sharing the video purportedly belonged to “Gabrielle Mcdowell,” but the account’s profile photo was lifted from a photoshoot for a Chinese model named Xu Yanxin. The account owner, whose posts were in Chinese, shared no personal details.
Such tactics are characteristic of China’s growing manipulation of social media to attack its perceived enemies, including dissidents like Guo, Hong Kong protesters, Taiwan and the U.S. Although Twitter is blocked in mainland China, officials there in recent years have increasingly used it to spread disinformation aimed at influencing the Chinese diaspora, Westerners and others globally. Foreign Ministry officials have signed up for Twitter accounts en masse, with officials overtly spreading conspiracy theories, including one that the U.S. military brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. The Chinese embassy didn’t respond to emailed questions for this article.
A Guo supporter, in a Chinese-language tweet to more than 20,000 followers, wondered about Dolgova’s role. “There are so many Sino-U.S. relations experts in China and the United States. Why did the big-name host decide to interview a Russian journalist with broken English?”
But borrowing foreign media like Dolgova is part of the Chinese state media playbook. “They procure a Russian journalist to act as the mouthpiece for the content they want to put out there,” said Roman Sannikov, a cybersecurity researcher who has looked into the spread of disinformation from Russia. “It’s too obvious to have a Chinese person.”
As his career has wound down, King has maintained a presence on American screens thanks in part to Russian state media.
At his peak from 1985 to 2010, as host of CNN’s “Larry King Live,” King was arguably America’s foremost television interviewer of politicians and celebrities. Guests included Nelson Mandela and every U.S. president since Richard Nixon; O.J. Simpson called into the show the day after he was acquitted of double murder in 1995. A Brooklyn native with a mellow, rumbling voice, King was an American original, known not only for his affable manner and easy banter, but also for his trademark suspenders, support for Israel and eight marriages. A member of both the national Radio and Broadcasting halls of fame, he’s twice won the Peabody Award, and he has also hosted the awards ceremony.
In his last month on CNN, December 2010, King interviewed Barbra Streisand, Angelina Jolie and Al Pacino, and two people who would influence the next stage of his career: Mexican telecom billionaire Carlos Slim and then-Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Without an immediate landing spot, King taped infomercials and other paid interviews. But he still yearned for his own show.
In March 2012, King and Slim announced the creation of Ora, funded by Slim’s América Móvil, the Latin American telecom giant. Ora, which means “now” in Italian and is Shawn King’s middle name, made several deals in 2013 with the Russian-controlled international news network RT to license and air its shows. The second Ora show that King hosted, “PoliticKING,” launched on RT America that June. “PoliticKING” is “a terrific fit for RT’s viewers around the world who want to see Larry engage leading lights on the critical issues of the day,” Margarita Simonyan, RT’s editor-in-chief, said.
RT has been criticized for censoring reporters and spouting the Russian government line. A January 2017 report by U.S. intelligence agencies called RT the Kremlin’s “principal international propaganda outlet.”
On several “PoliticKING” episodes, King interviewed members of Putin’s cabinet. He chatted with Russia’s then science and education minister, Dmitry Livanov, about growing tension between the U.S. and Russia in 2015. King also spoke with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in July 2018, an interview touted by RT.
RT has “never interfered” in his programs, King said. “I have a wonderful working agreement with them, they never bother me at all.” Ora’s Dickey and Anna Belkina, RT’s deputy editor in chief, concurred. “Everything we produce and license is unfettered, unbiased, uninfluenced,” Dickey said. King’s shows, including exclusive content for RT, are Ora’s “fully independent productions,” Belkina said.
In September 2018, six months before King taped the Dolgova video, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping attended a ceremony in Vladivostok, Russia. There, the Russian state-controlled Rossiya Segodnya news agency and Chinese state-controlled China Media Group signed an agreement to cooperate in news exchange, joint reporting and distribution, and promotion of each other’s reports, especially on social media.
Simonyan, the RT editor in chief who had praised the Ora deal as a “terrific fit,” also serves as editor in chief of Rossiya Segodnya. RT hailed the pact as “Russia & Asia working together to create new media language.” China Media Group head Shen Haixiong told RT there must be a “framework for strategic media cooperation, especially between Russia and China.” (China Media Group was established in 2018 to consolidate China’s largest state television and radio companies.) Dmitry Kiselyov, the head of Rossiya Segodnya, added that the new partners “need to fully understand how much Russia and Asia complement each other.”
The Russia-China partnership reflects the alignment of the two countries’ political messaging, as both promote alternatives to liberal democracy in a post-Cold War world. To achieve that goal, the Kremlin is building a “global media conglomerate,” said Nataliya Bugayova, a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. Russian media outlets have signed more than 50 cooperation agreements with foreign media since 2015, she said. Including the Vladivostok pact, Russian and Chinese state-run news agencies have agreed at least six times since 2017 to share content and technology, according to a study by Bugayova and George Barros.
China has initiated its own partnerships with foreign media organizations, said Louisa Lim, a journalist and senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne. About one-half of the journalism unions she recently surveyed in 58 countries had journalists participate in exchanges or training programs sponsored by Chinese organizations. More than one-third reported that their countries had entered into content-sharing agreements with Chinese outlets. Through these partnerships, China is “offering another model of journalism that is … designed to counter the Western media narrative,” she said.
The media relationship with Russia appears to have benefited China. On several occasions, outlets linked to Russia’s government have supported Chinese propaganda. In December 2019, for instance, RT aired a documentary that accused the U.S. of colluding with the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
When Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry, tweeted that reports of mass detention camps for China’s Uighur Muslim minority were the “LIE of the CENTURY,” she cited an article in the Grayzone, a website founded by Max Blumenthal, a frequent contributor to RT and the Russian-controlled Sputnik news agency. Similarly, Chinese government spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s tweet that the coronavirus originated in the U.S. cited a website previously found by NATO to spread Russian propaganda.
China and Israel are also drawing closer. China has become Israel’s second-largest trading partner, behind the U.S., and a Shanghai-based company has a 25-year contract to manage the container terminal of Haifa’s seaport. On a May visit to Israel, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that letting China invest in such critical infrastructure was a security risk and would jeopardize “the capacity for America to work alongside Israel on important projects.”
Guo, the subject of the King video, is among the earliest and most frequent targets of China’s covert Twitter influence operations, according to an analysis of Twitter-released data by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. ProPublica’s own analysis found that more than half of the nearly 30,000 accounts that Twitter has linked to the Chinese government and suspended had targeted Guo in at least one tweet. The tweets call him a liar, a cheat and rapist who should be repatriated — paralleling Dolgova’s accusations in the video.
Guo rejected those accusations through his attorney, Daniel Podhaskie. “The fact that Guo is the most targeted individual by the Chinese Communist Party’s fake social media arsenal reflects the CCP’s fruitless efforts to discredit Guo and silence his campaign to bring freedom to the Chinese people,” Podhaskie said.
A real estate developer and investor, Guo fled China in 2014 as the government began to arrest his business associates. The next year, Chinese media began accusing him of wielding political connections for personal gain: most luridly, of gaining control of a luxury hotel development in Beijing by leaking a sex tape — obtained from a top Chinese intelligence official — of an uncooperative city bureaucrat. Chinese authorities have sought his arrest on corruption allegations, which he has denied.
In January 2017, Guo resurfaced in New York. He accused Chinese officials of corruption and called for regime change in live-streamed videos broadcast from his $67.5 million penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park. China responded with the Twitter campaign, which began in April 2017.
Guo has made powerful allies in the U.S. He is a member of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, and his associates include former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, who has a $1 million contract with Guo’s media company for promotional services. On a recent podcast with Bannon, Guo accused China of releasing the novel coronavirus from a Wuhan research lab and covering up the true death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dolgova says in the video that Guo and Bannon “tried to create a fund … to fight Communism and yet no one has heard of that fund or heard anything from Bannon.” In a statement, Bannon said, “This is a war to the knife with the Chinese Communist Party — I’m honored they consider me public enemy #1 against their totalitarian regime.”
Everyone has a different story about how Niv and King first met. Niv told an Israeli magazine that former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon sent King a letter of introduction. King said he had “no memory of that at all,” adding that a former Beverly Hills mayor introduced them. Danny Ayalon, former Israeli ambassador to the U.S., told ProPublica that he introduced them at Niv’s request around 2011.
Regardless, “I liked him right away,” King said in a 2017 interview with an Israeli outlet. “Then we forged this kind of partnership and investment firm. I have a lot of confidence in him, and I think he’s a terrific thinker and a futurist — he looks ahead.”
King’s wife, Shawn, was less enamored of Niv, especially after their experience with businessman Mykalai Kontilai. In the mid-2010s, Kontilai asked the Kings to host a television show called “Collectors Cafe,” promoting a collectibles auction website Kontilai planned to launch. The Kings also attended Kontilai’s dinners with investors, and Larry introduced him to Slim. Kontilai “for sure” used Larry’s credibility to attract and retain investors, King said. Larry taped segments with celebrities including actor Dick Van Dyke, designer Betsey Johnson and rapper Joseph Simmons of Run DMC. The show was never broadcast and the site never launched. In May 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint in federal district court against Kontilai, alleging he misappropriated more than $6.1 million of investors’ money to “fund his lavish lifestyle.” The case is pending.
Shawn had expressed her distrust of Niv to Larry, but he had shrugged her off, he and others said. In a 2014 letter to the director of a hotel in the Alpine resort of St. Moritz, Switzerland, where Niv was seeking to stay, Niv had referred to “Larry King Now” as “my new show” and to Slim as “my partner.” (Niv told ProPublica that his assistant mistakenly used the wrong template.) Such instances led King’s manager — Shawn’s father, Karl Engemann — and Ora’s attorney to send letters in 2014 and 2015 to Niv warning him to stop misrepresenting his relationships with Larry and the company.
Niv is variously described in Israeli news articles and on his Facebook page as president of “Larry King Foundation”; “KING Entertainment Group”; and “Larry King Holding Company.” ProPublica could find no such entities, and King said they don’t exist. Niv said he made up the names “to describe what we are doing.”
“He was obviously playing off my name,” King said. “I did sign a few things [with Niv], but they went away because the business went out. … I said, sure I’ll help. And then suddenly it was gone. Then he’d have another thing, and it was gone. He’s a wheeler-dealer, but I felt sorry for him. I never envisioned him hurting anyone. But I certainly don’t like him using my name without my authority. It’s dangerous, what he’s doing.”
In 2014, Israeli media reported on Niv’s launching of the “Israel Silicon Valley Chambers of Commerce” with King and Technion Israel Institute of Technology. ProPublica found no evidence of the organization’s existence. Technion spokeswoman Doron Shaham said that “preliminary discussions … did not bear fruit. There has been no interaction with Mr. King or his representatives since then.”
Niv’s actual businesses mostly failed. In 2004, when Niv was 21, he co-founded Koteret, or Headline in Hebrew, a magazine that attracted well-known Israeli journalists, including Ofri Ilani. When Niv recruited him, “I left my previous job and moved on to Koteret,” Ilani recalled. “The wage was low but there was a promise that the magazine would develop and become the Israeli New Yorker.” The magazine folded after several issues.
In 2012, Niv and Larry co-foundedLCI-LifeChanging Internet LLC in California, according to archived versions of its website. It aimed to develop digital platforms and content, and is no longer active. “He is an amateur bad businessperson with an ambition to gain notoriety just through the networking but not necessarily understanding how to launch products,” said Calvin Mays, the group’s former head of marketing. Niv also formed LK Eyewear LLC, which never got off the ground.
Niv dismissed criticism of his business acumen. “Overall, I’m very happy and proud with my initiatives,” he said in an email.
Niv recently established an online store for adult incontinence products. “Our co-founder Larry King is a senior himself,” the website says. “…During his own quarantine, he noticed the lack of specialized services for the elderly, many of whom have existing issues with mobility and other forms of accessibility.”
In November 2018, an Israeli magazine ran a cover story, “Larry King’s Prince,” about the friendship between Niv and King, with five photos of them together: King in his suspenders and blue tie, Niv sporting a Burberry shirt in one shot, a Hermes belt in another. Niv boasted of moving in A-list circles: meals with Tina Turner and Rihanna, a trip to a spa with Naomi Campbell.
“Did you know that the legendary interviewer Larry King’s right-hand man is Israeli?” the article asked rhetorically.
The article intrigued Rapoport, who had founded his production company in 2007. After reading it, he called Niv, reaching him at a mall in California, Niv said. Rapoport told him that he was impressed by Niv’s other videos featuring King and pitched the idea of an online conference about U.S-China relations, Niv said.
“He told me: ‘The first video we want to do is about people that went out from China to the U.S. And I have a reporter, she made a study on it, she’s very knowledgeable about the case, and Larry can interview her,’” Niv said.
Niv said he recognized Rapoport’s name as a former news reporter on an Israeli television channel. Rapoport’s firm, which has a number of major Israeli companies as clients, prides itself on making promotional videos that resemble actual news. Its website highlights the effectiveness of this approach with viewers: “84% accept private news as real news!”
Recently, Rapoport’s company has done other work related to China. In September 2019, his company shot footage for a video for an Israeli builders’ group about the Haifa port, where Shanghai International Port Group won the 25-year deal to operate the container terminal. “The Israelis are running the business here, the Chinese are [putting] in the hard physical work,’” he wrote on his Facebook page at the time. His post included a photo of the flags of Israel, China and SIPG — the Shanghai port operator — flying side by side.
Rapoport’s proposal delighted Niv. “I went to Larry, and I told him, ‘Larry, look, it’s the first time that someone approached me because he knows that I know you,’” Niv said. “‘This is what he wants to do, what do you think about it?’ He looked at it, he told me, ‘Let’s do it.’”
One month before the taping at Ora, Rapoport sent Niv a message on WhatsApp, giving him a choice of Dolgova or an Italian journalist as King’s video guest. Niv said he picked Dolgova because “she looks better in front of the camera.”
Rapoport sent Niv several videos of Dolgova and told him she is “a star” on Russian television, Niv said. “I thought OK, it’s someone good to talk with, and that’s it.”
Niv didn’t independently verify Rapoport’s information about either Dolgova or Guo. “I didn’t need to do due diligence about the guy that she’s speaking about,” he said. Rapoport “told me that he is a very, very, very, very bad guy. … I said OK.” Niv also didn’t ask Rapoport about the identity of the client who was sponsoring the conference, he said.
After receiving a transcript of Dolgova’s answers from Rapoport, Niv said, he showed it to King over breakfast at a Beverly Hills coffee shop. “Larry told me, ‘Look Jacobi, it doesn’t really matter because she’s the one who made the research, I’m only interviewing her,’” Niv said.
King said he doesn’t recall seeing Dolgova’s responses. “I have no idea who that lady was or what she said. All I know is, I got a list of questions and I asked them.”
Initially, Niv said, Rapoport wanted King to interview Dolgova on one of the Ora programs, but Niv replied that it wouldn’t be possible. Niv had King pre-tape the questions to “save Larry’s time,” he said. “We do it often.”
On March 28, 2019, the day after the taping at the studio, Niv sent the completed video to King’s assistant. As he and Rapoport had arranged, he asked for it to be posted to King’s official social media. Rovou, King’s executive producer, dug in.
“It is offensive to me as a journalist and a producer and I think it should be so for Larry, too,” Rovou wrote to the assistants to Larry and Shawn King. “It’s one thing if he’s paid to do this for a conference video to be seen somewhere internally but it should not see the light of day or be bounced around on his social media.”
Five days later, it still wasn’t posted, so Niv sent a follow-up text to King’s assistant.
“I really don’t want to bother you but it’s not on yet,” he wrote. “Larry said it will be posted today. … I’m really concerned about the timetable with the conference. They are on the edge with that.”
Niv had a backup plan. He created a channel for King on YouTube, posted the video there and sent a link to King’s assistant. On April 5, the assistant sent it to Rovou, who was furious. He hadn’t known that the video would be available on social media. “I thought this was dropped?” he replied, adding Shawn King and her father to the email thread.
Watching the video, Shawn King was baffled; she had never heard of Guo. She was also upset by Larry’s uncharacteristic mistakes. Less than an hour after receiving Rovou’s email, she called Niv and demanded that he remove the video from YouTube. She yelled into the phone that he should have run the deal past her or her father.
“That woman that you say is a journalist, there is nothing, nothing on the internet that says anything,” she told Niv. “She has no credentials. … Larry didn’t even interview her. She was dropped in with the questions. It’s a script. It wasn’t in an interview.”
“You are ruining his brand,” she continued. “You were told many years ago: Do not go directly to Larry. … And when you saw him, you didn’t say, ‘Oh wow, he doesn’t look so good, let’s just kill this thing.’ Don’t ever go to Larry again.”
Niv took it down, he said, but it was already out of his hands. Suddenly, on April 9, King’s video rampaged through social media. That day, a Twitter account with more than 300,000 followers posted the link. The account’s first seven years of posts had been deleted, indicating that it had been hijacked and repurposed.
“While discussing China-US trade negotiations on his show, Mr. Larry King ended up talking only about Guo Wengui’s rape case,” the account tweeted. Guo’s “reputation in the U.S. already stinks.” Twitter later determined that the account was related to a Chinese government influence operation.
There were other signs of a carefully orchestrated campaign. The video had been posted on dozens of unrelated YouTube channels. It also appeared within a short time across social media accounts with limited discussion and engagement between them. In quick succession, some Facebook accounts shared inaccurate English and Chinese transcripts of King’s exchange with Dolgova, suggesting that the script had been circulated in advance.
Alarmed at the video’s sweep across social media, Rovou reached out again to Shawn King. She was driving to watch the older of her and Larry’s two sons play baseball when Rovou called. She pulled her car over and looked on her phone at the links Rovou was sending her.
She called Niv and berated him. When she arrived at the baseball game, he called back, telling her that he did the video as a favor to Larry and that “they” had fooled him, according to two people familiar with the conversation.
Niv didn’t tell Shawn King who “they” were. But he vowed to call them immediately to insist they remove the video from YouTube.
Over a series of emails, Shawn King pressed Niv. “I’m beyond disappointed and furious,” she wrote. “Why on earth is that video back up? You have no right to post it. Take it down immediately.”
Niv replied that the video “was not posted by me or my people. … The only one who has it is us and the conference people, which probably did it WITH NO PERMISSION!” he wrote. “We will request YouTube to remove it immediately.”
Aside from the China video, the other videos Larry King participated in were “small beautiful projects supporting Israel,” Niv assured Shawn. The videos were “not a business for us,” he wrote. “I did it from time to time mainly for Larry if he needed, and to support Israel.” He added that Larry earned a $7,000 “down payment” followed by an additional $3,000 in cash for participating in the video. (In a phone interview, he said that Larry’s share may have been $7,000, and that Niv got the remainder, an amount he didn’t specify.)
Niv told ProPublica that, as a result of concerns about how King looked in the video, “we decided to remove it and redo the conference at a different time. No one ever stated anything about the content of this one chapter of the overall conference.”
If Niv “had any intent or interest” in disparaging Guo, he added, “I would obviously leave the video there and wouldn’t take tremendous effort to remove it immediately.”
As the video continued to pop up, Niv said, he called Rapoport. “I told him: ‘Itai, something here is driving me crazy. What is happening here? I don’t understand.’ He gave me all kinds of excuses.” Niv then enlisted a friend at an Israeli television company to help him take down the video, he said. (Rovou also asked YouTube to remove it.)
In the meantime, King’s health was deteriorating. That month, he had a stroke. “I was out of it for most of April,” he said. “I woke up in intensive care. … They thought I was going to die.”
Niv is not registered as a foreign agent. Given the circumstances of the video, it is “likely” that he should be, and possibly King as well, said Sanderson, the Foreign Agents Registration Act attorney. The act would apply if the request, direction or funding for the video came from a foreign source, he said. The maximum penalty for a willful violation is five years in prison, or a $250,000 fine, or both.
Since U.S. media are exempt from registering, King’s exposure to FARA might rest on whether he was “acting in his capacity as a member of the news media, or is he doing an infomercial where he’s paid specifically to do the interview,” Sanderson said. “The substance of some of his questions and the structure of the interview itself could undercut his claim to be exempt.” Given his age, King could also argue he was “doing something at the behest of a longtime business partner who he regularly knows and trusts … and that he didn’t know about the origins of any money or request.”
That excuse might not help Niv, Sanderson said. “If you’re an international businessman, to say that you accepted money in an outside-the-norm type of transaction or message, and you didn’t do any investigative work to determine what the actual purpose of the task was — just accepting money, sight unseen — typically the (Justice) Department hasn’t accepted that type of argument,” Sanderson said. “…Ignorance and naivete are not free passes here.”
Foreign agents are required to file with the Justice Department the message they’re distributing — in this case, the transcript and video link — at the time it is distributed. The video itself should include a disclaimer identifying it as informational material distributed on behalf of a foreign principal.
“One of the issues here is should people have been on notice that this was distributed on behalf of the foreign government,” Sanderson said.
King said that, as an interviewer, he shouldn’t need to register.
“Would I register as a foreign agent? That’s crazy. I’m not a foreign agent.”
Niv denied working for China. “I never got approached by anyone that was related to China,” he said. “No one Chinese.” Rapoport “told me we are doing a video for him.”
The King video is harder to find online than it once was. YouTube has taken many copies down. By May of this year, aiming to combat Chinese disinformation, Twitter suspended and released data on nearly 30,000 Chinese government influence accounts, many of which had spread the video.
ProPublica found only 14 Facebook accounts still online that had posted the video or its transcript. Seven other accounts that we identified as making similar posts in 2019 are no longer online. Facebook declined to comment on whether it had taken down those accounts; their owners could also have removed them. We couldn’t trace any of the 21 accounts to their actual owners, suggesting that they had been fake.
Guo’s supporters were appalled by the video — and couldn’t believe King was involved. Most of their discussions on Twitter came to the same conclusion: It was a sophisticated political deep fake that used machine learning to imitate King’s voice and likeness. Guo himself took that view. On April 10, the day after the video began to circulate, he live-streamed a message to his followers.
“When we looked up the videos, virtually all of them were posted by wumao on YouTube,” Guo said, using a common term for Chinese government-funded internet trolls. “The transcript of the fake interview was released at the same time.”
Echoing the same false assumption, Guo’s lawyer asked Ora on April 18 to join in “legal action” to take down the video. “The creator of the Video clearly doctored Larry King footage,” Podhaskie wrote. “Not only does the Video make false claims about my client, it impersonates Larry King and appears to signify Mr. King’s endorsement of the defamatory remarks.”
This year, Ora laid off many staffers and moved out of the Glendale studio. The pandemic has delayed plans to tape some Ora programs at RT’s Los Angeles studio. “Larry King Now” had its final episode in February. Its replacement is a show hosted by comedian Dennis Miller.
King recently renewed his contract for “PoliticKING” through 2021-2022. He’d like to keep working for the rest of his life and “collapse on the set asking a question,” he said.
Ora no longer allows King to tape infomercials on the set, Dickey said. “What was an accommodation to his schedule and his age, … we just can’t put ourselves in that position any more, and we don’t.”
Niv’s incontinence business has changed its mission. It will now have “free online courses” to help the elderly, he said. Rapoport asked him for more videos featuring King, but Niv wasn’t interested, he said. He told Rapoport that he didn’t want anything more to do with him.
“Seriously, who needs this headache?” Niv said. The China video “really put me in a very bad position, and I really hate it, and I feel like I don’t deserve it. I never, ever thought that there is something not right.”
“I felt like someone took advantage of me,” he continued. “I wish that I knew (about the connection to China), and I wish that I knew it on time. … Today I am more intelligent, I am more knowledgeable.”
In a Facebook post on Feb. 4, Rapoport displayed a photo of himself behind interlocking table-top flags of Israel and China. “Preparing super interesting lecturers for an economic conference that will be held tomorrow,” he wrote.
After almost 22 years of marriage, Larry King filed for divorce from Shawn in August 2019. (The divorce is pending.) They remain close and talk regularly by phone, he said.
Based on the revelations about the video, King said he is “breaking off relations” with Niv, including “bowing out” of the incontinence venture. He now believes, he said, that Niv took advantage of his friendship, and that the gifts on Jewish holidays were “part of the con.”
On July 20, four days after receiving emailed questions from ProPublica, Niv called King. He arranged to come over the next day “to bring me a cake and take a picture with me,” King said. On Shawn’s advice, King canceled the date.
Shawn King and Rovou “turned out to be right,” King said. “Shawn has always said I’m easily taken advantage of.”

Rather, Mueller stressed that because of the U.S. Department of Justice policy against indicting a sitting president, it was up to members of Congress to read his report and draw their own conclusions. This week, Norm Eisen, former special counsel for the House Judiciary Committee, discussed the Mueller report with Yahoo News for the “Skullduggery” podcast — and was highly critical of Mueller for not charging Trump with obstruction.
Eisen said of Mueller, “He failed because he brought a 19th Century mentality, a 19th Century ethics and honor, to a 21st Century problem. It’s like trying to put out a burning building with a water pistol. His report just did not, was not fit for the purpose. It did not address the crisis represented by a President Trump, who is attacking all the fundamentals of our rule-of-law constitutional republic system.”
Eisen told Yahoo News that it was “unconscionable” for Mueller to “let Trump get away with lying.” According to Eisen, Mueller “hints at the need for impeachment” in his final report but “should have been bold like (former Independent Counsel Kenneth) Starr and said, ‘In my view, I recommend impeachment.’ He should have released the report or made a public statement immediately. He wrote a private letter to the attorney general, (William Barr), and the attorney general distorted his findings. He said, ‘Oh, please release my summaries.’ But Barr’s as bad as Trump in abusing the system. These are 21st Century abusers. They know how to spin and manipulate.”
During his appearance on the “Skullduggery” podcast, Eisen was promoting his new book, “A Case for the American People: The United States v. Donald J. Trump” — which discusses Trump’s impeachment. In the book, Eisen reveals that he drafted ten articles of impeachment against Trump before the Ukraine scandal and that some of them were based on the Mueller report.
Trump was not impeached because of the Russia investigation, but because of the Ukraine scandal. Even after the Mueller report was released in early 2019, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued to oppose impeaching Trump — although she changed her mind in a major way after learning that Trump, on July 25, 2019, had tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden (now the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee) and his son, Hunter Biden. Because of the Ukraine scandal, Pelosi went from being the Democratic Party’s most prominent impeachment skeptic to being a leading proponent of impeachment.
One of the results of Mueller’s Russia investigation was the prosecution of veteran GOP operative and long-time Trump ally Roger Stone, who Mueller indicted on charges ranging from obstruction of justice to lying to Congress to witness tampering. Ultimately, Stone was sentenced to three years of federal prison, but on Friday, July 10, Trump commuted his sentence.
Eisen believes that if Stone deserved to be charged with obstruction of justice, so did Trump. The attorney told Yahoo News, “Bob didn’t even confront Trump. He didn’t force Trump to testify. He let Trump get away with lying and pretending he doesn’t remember…. Those honorable decisions and leaving it to others to decide, leaving it to Congress…. letting Barr manipulate, completely neutered his investigation. And as I explain, we never recovered from that — and that is a tragedy.”

Enten pointed to some recent polling from Fox News showing that voters vastly prefer Biden over Trump when it comes to handling the coronavirus pandemic and race relations, while noting that Biden has even taken a slight edge over the president for who would be best for the economy.
“Look at that — President Trump does not lead on a single issue,” Enten exclaimed. “He’s getting blown out by double digits on coronavirus and race relations, but even on the economy, Joe Biden is basically breaking even with President Trump.”
Enten went on to explain why this is particularly ominous news for the president’s chances of winning the 2020 election.
“You look back through history and look at the most important issues before an election, whoever’s leading on the most important issues tends to win,” he said. “And right now, President Trump is not leading on a single one of those, including even the economy.”
The bottom line, argued Enten, is “unless the political environment changes over the next 95 days, President Trump will almost certainly be a one-term president.”

0,2020-07-30T12:29:08+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/yale-psychiatrist-the-president-is-mentally-incapable-of-leading/,Yale psychiatrist: The president ‘is mentally incapable of leading’,"AYale psychiatrist who has sounded the alarm on President Donald Trump’s mental health for years says that Mary Trump’s book warning that her uncle is too unstable to lead the country corroborates what mental health professionals have been saying since before the president took office.
Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, wrote in her new book “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man,” that she believes her uncle suffers from multiple personality disorders.
“I have no problem calling Donald a narcissist — he meets all nine criteria. But the label gets us only so far,” she wrote. “A case could be made that he also meets the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, which in its most severe forms is generally considered sociopathy but can also refer to chronic criminality, arrogance, and disregard for the rights of others…. Donald may also meet some of the criteria for dependent personality disorder, the hallmarks of which include an inability to make decisions or take responsibility, discomfort with being alone, and going to excessive lengths to obtain support from others.”
She went on to suggest that Trump has a “long-undiagnosed learning disability that for decades interfered with his ability to process information.”
Bandy X. Lee, a forensic psychiatrist at Yale School of Medicine and a former research fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health, told Salon that she has been warning about exactly this since Trump’s election. Lee suggested that Trump’s recent deployment of federal forces to cities like Portland and Chicago was intended to distract from questions over his mental fitness.
“We know what Donald Trump is doing in dispatching federal forces into cities by what he did at the last election when he sent 5,600 active military troops to the southern border because of an ‘invasion’ by a migrant caravan: he is turning a non-concern into a campaign issue in order to distract from the real issues,” she said in an interview. “What are the real issues? That his expert niece just exposed that he is mentally incapable of leading and is committing mass murder — what we independently said since a year ago, based on a standardized assessment, and since a month ago, because of his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.”
Despite guidelines precluding mental health professionals from diagnosing patients they have not personally examined, Lee and others have argued that they have a duty to society that is separate from making a diagnosis and have sought to warn about the dangers of Trump’s mental health since the 2016 election.
Lee, the author of the textbook “Violence,” is the president of the World Mental Health Coalition, which issued a “Prescription for Survival” during Trump’s presidency earlier this year and is launching a podcast series with radio host and former California Democratic Party chair Bill Press that features many of the authors included in the book “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President,” which Lee edited.
Lee spoke with Salon about Mary Trump’s book, the president’s enablers, and the American Psychiatric Association’s guidelines against discussing the president’s mental health.
Mary Trump’s new book highlights many of the same concerns about Trump’s mental health that you’ve warned about for years. What did you think of her conclusions? Did anything surprise you? Is there anything you disagree with? 
Yes, I was delighted to see this. But then she is a professional who is highly proficient at what she does, as evidenced in the scholarship and clinical soundness she applies to her reasoning. Any honest and competent mental health professional has come to the same conclusion, which is why there was an astonishing consensus from the start.
Yet, like history repeating itself, no amount of professionalism — expertise, evidence and facts — seems to matter. We are literally dying for our inability to understand expertise. I started an interview series with my colleagues just because there has been little concept of what she was bringing, or somehow the media cannot go there. Three and a half years ago, I would not have believed this was possible, but after the biggest newspapers and cable and network stations deleted only my quotes or killed entire articles, and broadcasts canceled at the last minute almost 70 times, it would rather surprise me if public discussion were ever allowed to reach critical mass.
Mary Trump describes her uncle as the “world’s most dangerous man.” You and other psychiatrists have made similar arguments. Why do you think these warnings have gotten so little traction among lawmakers, particularly members of the Republican Party? 
People will not like this, but it is an indication of the poor state of mental health in our society. We would rather resort to all manner of extreme conspiracy theories, such as QAnon, to justify the unjustifiable — the continuation of a presidency that should never have been for a day — and to deny the undeniable — that a president who is supposed to protect us is killing us. Ironically, the American Psychiatric Association played a central role in enabling denial and in creating stigma around even mentioning the topic, causing us to miss a crucial opportunity before the problem spun out of control.
In January 2018, the public and the media were listening, to the point where the president’s mental health had grown to the No. 1 topic of national conversation. Many of us were interviewing several hours a day, every day. But then the APA stepped in, grinding the discussion to a complete stop. Its influence was decisive, since I and my colleagues had met with over 50 members of Congress, and they were counting on us to educate the public so that they could act. Instead, the APA has effectively conditioned our culture into expecting not to hear from mental health experts about the mental health of the president, the most consequential public servant on whom our lives depend.
Mental health itself had been gaining more respect as a result of decades of education, but through an aggressive misinformation campaign by the APA, on which I blew a whistle, we have been thrown back into a dark age. We are suffering the same with the novel coronavirus: what distinguished our time from the Middle Ages was science and knowledge. Removing these, we have the plagues again.
Do you think that the book will lead to more discussion about the president’s mental health in mainstream political circles that have largely avoided the topic? 
I hope so, and the public dearly hopes so, judging from the incessant requests that pour in for us to speak more. But the more people clamor for us, the more tightly we are censored out of the major media. For 15 years I taught students at Yale Law School representing political asylum seekers escaping autocracies, so I recognize the pattern of suppression, primarily of expertise and facts. Madeleine Albright recently repeated a phrase I often use: “Fascism is not a political ideology.” I usually add: “It is mental pathology writ large.”
The actions of the American Psychiatric Association, the Department of Justice and the Republican Party make no sense from a scientific, legal or rational point of view. But they make perfect sense from a power-alignment perspective. The regressed psychology of the president demands this, just as any other autocrat. The next phase is, literally or figuratively, elimination of portions of the population that do not comply or remind the autocrat of reality. We have seen Donald Trump remove scientists from their positions or cut their funding, because science challenges his fantastical thinking.
Trump has repeatedly cited his “acing” of a mental cognitive test as proof of his mental fitness. Why do you think he keeps bringing this up, particularly in the context of his attempts to paint Joe Biden as unfit? 
He is likely frantically trying to convince himself that he is mentally fit. This is because the now-removed White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, falsely used the 10-minute cognitive screen — which has nothing to do with fitness and which researchers have found full-blown Alzheimer and hospitalized schizophrenia patients to “ace”, by the way — to declare the president “fit.” The president is resurrecting it to try to use it to the same effect, but of course he only gives himself away. We know what he thinks of himself by what he says of Joe Biden. Projection is a way of disowning what you cannot tolerate in yourself by attaching it to others, and since his case is severe, what he says almost has nothing to do with Biden but is a very accurate portrayal of himself.
Top officials like Bill Barr and Chad Wolf have deployed federal officers to cities like Portland in response to protests. What does it mean for someone whose danger has been described by numerous mental health professionals to lead what Oregon officials have described as an invading force, particularly ahead of an election? 
Well, this is exactly what we anticipated he would do. In February, I warned that the very delayed impeachment and subsequent acquittal would powerfully inflate his delusions of grandeur and impunity, such that he was now likely to thwart the electoral process and use force to remain in office. The pandemic has accelerated this process. For this reason, I have been advising activist groups not to wait until after the election — and so there should be notices about nonviolent action sooner. If he succeeds in forcing a second term, he will likely use it purely for revenge, and I agree with Dr. Trump that our democracy and our nation as we know it will not survive.

“At fund-raising events where he has pulled in more than $24 million for Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s campaign in the past two months, former President Barack Obama has privately unleashed on President Trump to party donors, bringing up past accusations of Mr. Trump’s ‘assaulting women’ and warning of his efforts to push ‘nativist, racist, sexist’ fears and resentments,” reported Shane Goldmacher and Glenn Thrush.
“With less than 100 days until the presidential election, Mr. Obama has laid out the stakes of 2020 in forceful fashion,” continued the report. “He has urged support for Mr. Biden, his former vice president, while worrying about the state of American democracy itself, even making an oblique reference to Nazi Germany, according to notes made from recordings of Mr. Obama’s remarks, donors and others who have been on the calls.”
“It’s just glued to Fox News and Breitbart and Limbaugh and just this conservative echo chamber — and so, they’re going to turn out to vote,” said Obama. “What he has unleashed and what he continues to try to tap into is the fears and anger and resentment of people who, in some cases, really are having a tough time and have seen their prospects, or communities where they left, declining. And Trump tries to tap into that and redirect in nativist, racist, sexist ways.”
Obama has publicly been more careful about direct criticism of his successor, often avoiding mentioning him by name even when making indirect criticisms.

Trump properties are well-documented hot spots for MAGA-world luminaries and hangers-on, particularly Trump International Hotel in Washington, where the lobby is frequently a blur of lobbyists, administration officials, lawmakers, corporate leaders and foreign dignitaries — the physical embodiment of the president’s numerous conflicts of interest.
But in a sense those properties are also real-world iterations of the president’s Twitter feed, a running scroll of the same groups. Both are also sprinkled to varying degrees with influential right-wing extremists and internet trolls (Diamond and Silk kicked off their 2019 “Chit Chat Live” tour at Trump Hotel D.C.), some of whom now are now moving into legitimate electoral politics under the auspices of the Republican Party in various states, including Oregon, Colorado, Georgia and Trump’s new home state of Florida.
And though Trump fandom is little more than an ironic lark to young fringe-right adherents, who see themselves as more pure, edgy and extreme, those places draw an older generation that has influence, but might be looking for someone who knows better how to wield it today.
“Trump properties are the place to be if you’re an elected Republican looking to dip your toe in alt-right waters. So no one should be surprised that once-mainstream Republicans and the NRCC are now backing the very QAnon supporters and fringe factions they’ve mingled with for years,” said Kyle Morse, an American Bridge 21st Century spokesperson.
The more high-profile of these patron-extremists include:
Laura Loomer, an anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist and Trump-favored congressional candidate
Jack Posobiec, an internet troll, Pizzagate truther and OANN reporter
Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist and accused Holocaust denier who founded the far-right Groyper movement
Baked Alaska, aka Tim Gionet, alt-right internet troll and supposedly reformed neo-Nazi
Chuck Johnson, a right-wing activist once described as “the most hated man on the internet”
Trump properties are a particularly popular draw for the Fuentes-led Groyper movement, a loose affiliation of far-right and alt-right nationalists who peddle racist and anti-Semitic tropes while mocking mainstream conservatives — including some less radical white nationalists — as phonies.
As with most things born in the nether regions of the internet, the origins of the Groyper movement are not easy to understand. Its name is drawn from a specific Pepe the Frog pose, in which the alt-right cartoon mascot rests his chin on his interlinked hands.
Marilyn Mayo, senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremis, described the movement in a 2019 interview.
“What they’re trying to do, there’s this whole grouping who refer to themselves as the dissident right, they want to move the Overton window,” said Mayo, referring to the shifting spectrum of acceptable ideological and political discourse. “They want to make racism and anti-Semitism mainstream.”
Trump made waves this January when he retweeted a clip of Michelle Malkin, the self-described “mommy” of the Groyper movement, complaining about online censorship. Trump added his own caption, thanking her:
“The Radical Left is in total command & control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google. The Administration is working to remedy this illegal situation. Stay tuned, and send names & events. Thank you Michelle!”
That Malkin clip was produced by Fuentes’ internet show, America First.
“Donald Trump is watching America First Clips,” Fuentes tweeted.
Fuentes has attended events at Trump International in Washington, including with friend and fellow Groyper Megan Harris, and both appeared there during the conservative gathering CPAC this year, as documented in a since-deleted Instagram post. The two were joined at CPAC by musician and Groyper Ricky Rebel, who shared a number of pictures from Trump International on his Instagram story.
Fuentes, like several other fringe-right personalities, has also patronized Trump National Doral, the president’s golf resort near Miami, where he appeared in an Instagram photo with alt-right internet personality Baked Alaska (Tim Gionet).
Gionet, a former BuzzFeed writer who later got Trump’s face tattooed on his arm, has shared Instagram posts from Trump properties three times in the last year: at Doral National, and the Trump International hotels in Las Vegas and Washington. The last of those included a photograph of a burger and fries, captioned, “imagine eatin this good.”
Three summers ago, Gionet joined Fuentes at the infamous Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where he was billed as a scheduled speaker alongside leading white supremacist Richard Spencer. He has tweeted the “14 Words” (a well-known neo-Nazi phrase) and, in since-deleted tweets, shared videos of friends saying that “Hitler did nothing wrong.” He’s also posted images of people in gas chambers.
In March 2019, Gionet attempted to distance himself from the alt-right, denouncing it as hateful and violent. Following the mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, he posted a video in which he apologized for his contributions to the culture, but a few months later was caught spewing Islamophobia at an ICE protest. He subsequently linked up with the Groyper movement and deleted his apologies.
Other fringe-right associates of Gionet have spent time and money at Trump properties.
One of the more well-known names is alt-right personality, Pizzagate truther and noted misogynist Mike Cernovich, whom Gionet engaged in multiple projects. Cernovich has spent considerable time at Trump properties.
Gionet once spent Christmas with blogger Chuck Johnson, the aforementioned “most hated man on the internet,” who reportedly had a hand in vetting Trump Cabinet picks during the transition (working with Facebook’s Peter Thiel) — and may have acted as an inadvertent conduit between WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Donald Trump Jr.
In January 2017, Johnson posted on Facebook that he was “building algorithms to ID all the illegal immigrants for the deportation squads.” HuffPost quoted a source claiming to have seen Johnson discussing that same project with “a whole bunch of really important people” at the Trump hotel in D.C. Former Breitbart editor Katie McHugh has said that Johnson asked to be connected with senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller so he could pitch a “way to identify every illegal alien in the country.”
In 2018, Johnson was also spotted at Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.
Then there’s the Posobiec, who while not exactly a Groyper is a fringe conspiracy theorist with anti-Semitic views whom Trump has retweeted a number of times. Posobiec and his wife met Brexit architect Nigel Farage at the Trump Hotel in Washington in February, 2017, and have spent both Christmas and New Year’s holidays there.
In July 2019, Posobiec joined QAnon acolyte Tracy Beanz, MAGA alt-right memesmith Carpe Donktum and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders for a conservative conference called AMPFest, held at Trump National Doral. Documents obtained by the Washington Post showed that the Florida property’s revenues were “in steep decline” at the time.
Posobiec spread the debunked conspiracy theory that the Las Vegas mass shooter was affiliated with ISIS, but was challenged for credit by right-wing provocateur, Islamophobe and Trump patron Laura Loomer. The two seemed to smooth things over before AMPFest 2019, where Loomer appeared alongside Posobiec.
Loomer is currently running as a Republican congressional candidate in Florida’s 21st district — home to Donald Trump’s private Palm Beach club Mar-a-Lago, where she appeared at a 2019 winter gala that featured Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, former White House staffer Sebastian Gorka and guest of honor Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Just a few days after that, Trump tweeted his support for Loomer’s candidacy. And since the 21st is officially his district of residence, he will have the chance to vote for her should she appear on the ballot in November. (Her chances of winning are not strong: Incumbent Rep. Lois Frankel, a Democrat, was re-elected without opposition in 2018.)
On March 3, Loomer was back at Trump International in D.C.

Their fears came true,"“Colleagues feared U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert would catch COVID-19. Sure enough, he did.” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
WASHINGTON — It was a shock, but no surprise.
Whatever semblance of normal business remained on Capitol Hill during the COVID-19 outbreak was upended when U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Tyler Republican, disclosed Wednesday he tested positive for the COVID-19 virus.
Several other members of Congress similarly tested positive to little fanfare over the last several months. But Gohmert’s diagnosis unleashed a commotion on Capitol Hill unlike anything the nearly two dozen staffers, consultants, lobbyists and members interviewed for this story could recall in recent memory.
Gohmert’s aversion to wearing masks and following other practices intended to mitigate the spread of the virus led many here to believe he might eventually contract the virus and potentially expose his colleagues. For months, members and staffers on the Hill watched with simmering fury as Gohmert and a handful of other Republican lawmakers made their rounds each day without masks.
“I just find it very disturbing that there are still many of my colleagues, especially in [the] Judiciary [Committee], that are just not following the attending physicians’ guidelines,” said U.S. Rep. Sylvia R. Garcia, a Houston Democrat who spent much of Tuesday in the same room as Gohmert in a hearing that included testimony from U.S. Attorney General William Barr.
“We’re going to have to find a way to make it a rule — and perhaps make it a rule with sanctions — because we’re spending too much time in Judiciary either arguing about it or talking about it, and we’re all on edge because they’re not wearing their masks,” she added. “I’m not sure why, but it’s just very disturbing.”
Gohmert responded to the drama in an interview with East Texas Matters, a local news outlet, saying he tested positive for COVID-19 and was asymptomatic.
“I can’t help but wonder if by keeping a mask on and keeping it in place, if I might have put some … of the virus on the mask and breathed it in. … But the reports of my demise are very premature,” he said. “If somebody feels strongly about everybody should wear a mask, then they shouldn’t be around people that don’t wear masks.”
By evening, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced she would mandate masks on the House floor. But leadership had already mandated wearing masks in hearings, only to have some Republicans ignore the rules.
The outrage toward Gohmert was not restricted to Democratic circles. Current and former Texas Republican staffers interviewed by the Tribune expressed horror that widespread Capitol Hill fears about Gohmert had become reality.
Gohmert thrives on controversy. Usually, his provocations are met with eye rolling and private commentary within the close-knit Texas Republican Congressional world about “Louie’s being Louie.”
On Wednesday, it all became existential.
Throughout the day, current and former delegation insiders widely circulated via text a screenshot of a Politico story quoting a Gohmert staffer.
“When you write your story, can you include the fact that Louie requires full staff to be in the office, including three interns, so that ‘we could be an example to America on how to open up safely,’” wrote the Gohmert staffer. “When probing the office, you might want to ask how often were people berated for wearing masks.”
Politico also reported that Gohmert tested positive while at the White House, then chose to return to the Capitol complex to personally inform his staff.
“I don’t think that’s helpful for all the reasons,” said Texas GOP consultant Brendan Steinhauser, echoing a number of Republican staffers concerned about mask avoidance but not authorized to speak on the record. “It’s not good for their health. It’s not good for their staff. It’s not setting a good example, and it is irresponsible.”
The mask debate is not new; whether the state or local government should mandate the wearing of masks has opened an ideological divide. But a number of Texas members are more than eager to post photos of themselves wearing masks on social media, if only to set an example.
One Texas staffer observed that early on, it was mostly only female Republican members who embraced masks in the GOP conference. But as the virus began to rampage through conservative regions of the country, he noticed an uptick in mask-wearing among Republicans — to the point that now, members who avoid them are outliers.
And on Capitol Hill, wearing a mask is a national security issue.
The U.S. House includes a member of the presidential succession, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Gohmert participated in a hearing Tuesday in which the person who is seventh in the line of presidential succession, Barr, testified.
Additionally, the District of Columbia recently mandated the wearing of masks while in public.
Moreover, the Capitol, with its dependence on relationships and communication, is a uniquely problematic place for transmission. At the same time, members must travel mostly on planes and trains to Washington, interact with each other, and then return home to the same grocery stores that their constituents frequent.
And most worrisome of all, members of Congress tend to be older, and there are more than a few cancer survivors in the chamber — both factors that can translate into more severe complications from the virus.
“I wish that all the members of Congress would wear a mask, as we’ve been asked to do, to protect each other’s safety,” said U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio.
Even among conservatives who often express an aversion to a government mandate, there is enthusiasm for masks.
“I take the necessary precautions based on the situation, whether it’s social distancing or wearing a mask,” said U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Lubbock. “I just don’t see the need right now for universal masking, especially not mandated by government.”
Gohmert is, indisputably, the most controversial Texan serving in Congress. A friendly presence around the Capitol, he was best known early on in his U.S. House career for his tours of the Capitol dome and his skill at barbecuing ribs. He even has a Democratic friend or two.
On Wednesday, though, the snark and eye rolls about Gohmert shifted to pure outrage. And it had been a long time coming.
Early on in the pandemic, members watched anxiously when Gohmert was potentially exposed at a conservative gathering. A physician cleared him to return to the Capitol, but it added a layer of anxiety when Congress was still operating normally and the medical profession was still learning about incubation periods and proper quarantining procedures.
About a month ago, Gohmert told CNN, “I don’t have the coronavirus, turns out as of yesterday I’ve never had it. But if I get it, you’ll never see me without a mask.”
His colleagues found that logic problematic: People can have and unknowingly spread COVID-19 without having any symptoms.
In recent weeks, Gohmert had taken to wearing a bandana. Bandanas are not considered as safe as masks, and members noticed he frequently had the cloth pulled below his nose.
And in the lead-up to Wednesday, a Democratic member of Congress grew increasingly concerned for the Gohmert team after spotting Gohmert and a junior staffer walking and interacting with each other; neither wore masks.
As they heard the news, members frantically retraced their day, trying to remember any potential interactions with Gohmert and whether he was covering his face with the bandana.
U.S. Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, quickly announced she would self-quarantine when CNN reported she sat next to Gohmert on a Sunday plane ride to Washington. Granger, 77, is the senior-ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee and a player in negotiations over the coming spending package aimed at saving the economy amid the outbreak.
One former Republican House chief of staff speculated that Gohmert may have single-handedly impacted those negotiations, as members are frightened for their own safety, losing their trust their colleagues, and want to get out of the complex as soon as possible. In effect, there’s a sense the social contract of Congress is breaking down in real time.
Another former Republican staffer expressed frustration that members, staffers and reporters at the Capitol are not regularly tested before entering the premises.
CNN reported that U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin, was recently spotted on the U.S. House floor chatting with Gohmert, and neither man wore a mask. Roy said he would not self-quarantine but wore a mask Wednesday.
Roy added that he’s not concerned “anymore than the interactions with perfect strangers on an airplane with circulating air. With cotton masks on an airplane, where everybody is pretending like they’re doing something noble to try to save people from a virus on a cylinder with 50 people on it flying through the air.”
He questioned the effectiveness of masks but told CNN he is “happy to wear a mask.”
Earlier this summer, Republicans widely scorned Democrats for engaging in a newly implemented practice of designating colleagues to vote on their behalf. Castro now anticipates Democrats will more fully embrace the practice.
“I’ve talked to several members who are going to be proxy voting for the foreseeable future because of the potential health threat,” Castro said.
There is also potential political fallout — but likely not for Gohmert.
He regularly wins reelection in conservative East Texas by margins of nearly 50 percentage points, and he rarely faces serious primary challenges.
And it’s in his and other Texas districts where wearing a mask is perceived by some as crossing President Donald Trump, and where more than a handful of residents are skeptical of medical expertise or even consider the virus to be a hoax.
But even the president, who for months avoided face coverings, wore a mask while on a trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
Some Republicans worry about the public’s perception of Wednesday’s events. A number of consultants have tested mask-wearing in internal polling, and it is overwhelmingly popular in competitive districts.
“Failure to wear a mask while working in close proximity to members of Congress, administration officials, staff and reporters is breathtakingly stupid and gives liberals a tool to attack all Republicans for the troubled response to the COVID-19 epidemic,” said Michael Steel, a former spokesperson for former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner.
Steel, however, agreed with other Republicans who say there is an opportunity for members and candidates to separate themselves from those who shirk masks.
“There’s some candidates in some races who will be able to use that as a point of differentiation if they are acting responsibly, and there are benefits to that,” he added.
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was a member of the travel party to Texas and told reporters on Air Force One’s return to Washington on Wednesday evening that he learned of the news when Gohmert was not on the flight.
“I think the question of masks is overly politicized. I wear a mask regularly, particularly when I go out in public, and when I’m on the Senate floor I usually wear a mask,” he said. “When I’m out at the grocery store I wear a mask. I think it’s strange to see masks treated as this political talisman.”
“I don’t particularly understand folks who say, ‘I’ll never wear a mask no matter what,’ but I also don’t understand a lot Democrats who treat a mask as a sign of virtue.”
Business-minded Republicans have pushed hard for masks in Texas, in hopes that they will staunch the spread of the virus and allow the state to return to a more normal economy. Many members and their staffers say they wear masks and embrace quarantines both for safety and to set an example.
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who is seeking reelection this year, regularly posts on social media photos of himself wearing a mask at public events.
“It starts at the top,” said Cornyn campaign spokesperson Travis Considine, in reference to his candidate. “We’re taking the health and safety of everyone we’re going to interact with very seriously.”
Garcia, the Houston congresswoman, has had two COVID exposure scares and self-quarantined until tests cleared her.
And the profile photo on the Twitter account of U.S. Rep. Pete Olson, a Sugar Land Republican, showed the retiring congressman in a mask.
Back home in Texas, Austin-based Democratic consultant Jason Stanford watched the events in Washington from afar in dismay.
“There’s a reason Texas is a jump-ball state,” he said. “The reason is all of us are living this reality.”

And he’s totally on board with the false claim that Hydroxychloroquine might be an effective treatment or even cure for coronavirus.
In a historic virtual hearing Wednesday, the 21-term Republican from Wisconsin asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg why Twitter suspended the President’s son, Donald Trump , Jr., for 12 hours this week.
Zuckerberg was forced to correct the Congressman, who went on to falsely claim there is a valid debate about the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine.
“It was reported that Donald Trump, Jr. got taken down for a bit of time, because he put something up on the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine,” Rep. Sensenbrenner began.
“Now I wouldn’t take it myself, but there still is a debate on whether it is effective in treating or preventing COVID-19, and I think that this is a legitimate matter of discussion,” the Congressman, raising his voice, insisted.
The use of Hydroxychloroquine is not a legitimate matter of discussion. Studies show it does not prevent, cure, or assist in the treatment of COVID-19.
“It would be up to a patient and their doctor to determine whether Hydroxychloroquine was the correct medication, given the circumstances,” he continued.
“Why did that happen?” Sensenbrenner asked Zuckerberg, referring to Trump Jr. being blocked.
“Congressman, well, first to be clear, I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it’s hard for me to speak to that,” Zuckerberg responded.
Rep. Sensenbrenner and his staff got the question very wrong in many ways.
Aside from addressing the wrong CEO – he might have asked the CEO for Apple Tim Cook, about a Microsoft product – Donald Trump, Jr. didn’t just “put something up on the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine.”
Trump Jr. posted a fraudulent video featuring a quack doctor (a Houston pediatrician and the spiritual leader of Fire Power Ministries) who believes demons exist and having sex with them is harmful.
“She also maintains,” The Washington Post reports, “that alien DNA is a component of some therapeutic drugs and that government scientists are developing a vaccine to prevent religious faith.”
And to be clear, there’s a lot more.
Those demons, she believes, the Post explains, “are responsible not only for diseases of the female reproductive system but also for male impotence, most financial troubles, marital discord and spiritual malaise.”
As far as the fraudulent claim that Big Tech is silencing or censoring conservatives, the tech columnist for the New York Times, Kevin Roose, daily tweets out the 10 top-performing link posts by U.S. Facebook pages.
Here’s today’s:
Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino are right wing extremists, for those unaware.
As you can see, CNN is the only mainstream media outlet on the list.
This is a pretty average day. Rarely do any progressive or liberal sites make the top 10 list, although in the past few days Occupy Democrats reached the top 10 a few times.
Here’s Sensenbrenner in today’s hearing complaining about “censorship” of conservatives:

Need to stay updated on coronavirus news in Texas? Our evening roundup will help you stay on top of the day’s latest updates. Sign up here.
Vance Ginn, the chief economist for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, is facing fierce backlash for a recent racist tweet that said schools should open since most of the people dying from the coronavirus in Texas are elderly or Hispanic.
Before Monday, the state’s racial and ethnic breakdown of deaths had large gaps, with up to 18% of deaths last month recorded as “unknown.” A revised count of the data released Monday by the Department of State Health Services, however, shows that Hispanic Texans are overrepresented in the state’s updated fatality count.
Citing the revised data, Ginn tweeted that the people most likely to perish from the deadly virus are people older than 50 and Hispanics, whose death rate increased from 24.8% on May 27 to 47.4% on July 27. Hispanics make up about 40% of the state’s population.
Meanwhile, about 180 deaths, or 3% of the total, occurred among Texans younger than 40. About 2,000 people who died were 80 or older, making up the largest age bracket of COVID-19 deaths.
“Why not #openschools, end universal mandates, target vulnerable & check those from #Mexico?” Ginn wrote in a since-deleted tweet. He juxtaposed his tweet with a GIF of Prince Harry of Wales miming a mic drop.
He later apologized for tweeting the GIF. “It’s been brought to my attention that the gif may have been perceived as insensitive. I apologize as that was not my intention,” he tweeted.
In an interview with The Texas Tribune, Ginn said the intention of his Twitter thread was to outline the more thorough data provided by the state. He also said his tweet with the GIF was “woefully taken out of context out of bad faith.”
“What we’re really focused in on is, ‘How can we best make sure that Texans are taken care of during this time?’” he said. Given the revised data that shows demographic breakdowns, he questioned whether state and local officials should take a more “targeted approach” to combatting the virus, rather than passing blanket policies.
Ginn later removed the tweet and apologized. “I believe strongly based on my deep faith that every life is precious,” he wrote. “My intent was to highlight the positive development of more data available to make better policy decisions and help the vulnerable.”
Almost 53% of public school students were Hispanic in 2018-19 and more than 60% are economically disadvantaged, according to Texas Education Agency data. Public health experts have said schools that reopen in areas with high and fast-rising rates of community spread are likely to exacerbate the effects of the virus. That means staff and students could bring the virus home to their families.
“This is my grandfather Albert. He was an Hispanic citizen of the U.S. & passed from #Covid,” tweeted former state Rep. Jason Villalba, R-Dallas. “His grandchildren (born in Dallas) lived with him and also got #Covid. They survived. W/ great respect, the death of elderly Hispanics does not necessarily make the schools safe to open.”
Ginn, who previously served in the White House under President Donald Trump’s administration as associate director for economic policy at the Office of Management and Budget, also served as senior economist for the think tank.
While children may not be the most vulnerable to contracting the virus, fear of community spread has prompted some large school districts to delay the start of the fall semester for in-person instruction.
In mid-July, Texas education officials said school districts could delay on-campus instructions for at least four weeks and ask for waivers to continue remote instruction for up to four additional weeks in areas hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, districts must educate at least a small percentage of students in person and give the state information on what public health conditions would allow them to bring more kids into classrooms.
In recent months, the Republican Party has faced criticisms for appearing to prioritize the economy over public health, while research shows that COVID-19 disproportionally affects Black and Hispanic people.
Gov. Greg Abbott, too, has faced pushback from Democrats on his coronavirus response efforts. Although he implemented a statewide mask mandate earlier this summer, he’s been chided for a speedy phased reopening of the economy to which public health experts attribute a record number of coronavirus deaths in the state.

0,2020-07-30T11:07:03+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/yale-study-on-600-unemployment-lifeline-championed-by-democrats-destroys-gops-favorite-talking-point/,Yale study on $600 unemployment lifeline championed by Democrats destroys GOP’s favorite talking point,"A new study by Yale economists out this week debunks the repeated GOP talking point that the $600 federal expansion of unemployment benefits has disincentivized people from returning to work—findings published the same day Senate Republicans released a coronavirus relief proposal which critics condemned as an “utter disgrace” that will “unleash widespread suffering” on people nationwide.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act that Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed in late March provided those who qualified for unemployment insurance (UI) with an extra $600 per week on top of state benefits, a boost that meant total payments for some low-wage or middle-class workers exceeded their normal weekly incomes. With the GOP in the Senate now refusing to pass an extension approved by the Democrat-controlled House, those added benefits are set to expire on July 31.
Despite polling that shows the public popularity of the added boost—and economists warning that taking it away would spell financial catastrophe for the country—the Trump administration and GOP lawmakers who oppose an extension claim it encouraged layoffs early in the pandemic and deters people who make more from UI benefits than their former job from returning to work as businesses reopen.
The Yale study (pdf) destroys that GOP talking point. The economists examined weekly data from Homebase—a firm that provides scheduling and time clock software to small businesses—and found “no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work either at the onset of the expansion or as firms looked to return to business over time.”
“The data do not show a relationship between benefit generosity and employment paths after the CARES Act, which could be due to the collapse of labor demand during the Covid-19 crisis,” said co-author and Yale economics professor Joseph Altonji.
Although the Homebase data does not represent the entire U.S. labor market, as it is primarily focused on hourly workers at businesses like bars, restaurants, and retail stores, the segment of the workforce studied by the researchers has been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, as Yale News noted, “the researchers tested their results against employment outcomes in the federal government’s Current Population Survey, a more representative sample of the labor market than the Homebase data, and obtained similar findings.”
The Yale study found that people with expanded unemployment benefits actually resumed working at a similar or slightly quicker rate than others did. As MarketWatch reported Wednesday:
The Chicago Federal Reserve found a similar trend. “Those currently collecting benefits search more than twice as intensely as those who have exhausted their benefits,” a recent study conducted by the Chicago Fed concluded. Typically, unemployment benefits last six months and on average pay individuals approximately 35% of their previous weekly salary, according to the Chicago Fed. People on unemployment benefits on average spend more than 14 hours a week job searching and send more than 12 applications a month.
The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act that House Democrats passed in May would extend the $600 boost to UI benefits through January—but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has refused to put that measure to a vote.
The Senate GOP’s new Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection, and Schools (HEALS) Act, released Monday, would temporarily cut the weekly boost from $600 to $200 until states can implement a new, more complex system to pay laid-off workers 70% of what they earned before losing their jobs. Although the proposal is reportedly approved by the Trump White House, critics warn the system would likely overwhelm states and cause notable delays in relief to those who need it most.
As the congressional debates over Covid-19 relief drag on, CNBC/Change Research polling results published Wednesday show that most voters in six key swing states want lawmakers to continue the aid that was implemented in previous coronavirus relief legislation, including the the $600-per-week boost to UI. Across Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin 62% of voters somewhat or strongly support continuing that specific initiative.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) suggested in a Tuesday night televised interview with Chris Hayes of MSNBC that Republicans in Congress are failing to serve not only the American public but also their own electoral interests by trying to cut government assistance during the health crisis:
“It’s just a disgrace, what their bill does,” Schumer said broadly of the Republicans’ HEALS Act, which he called “a giveaway to corporate interests.”
“We Democrats are standing firm,” the Senate minority leader added. “We know the needs are real, we know the needs are deep, we know working people need help, and we are gonna fight for the very strong and very bold bill that the House passed called the HEROES Act.”

0,2020-07-30T11:03:37+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/lawmakers-warn-onerous-new-usps-loan-terms-imposed-by-mnuchin-could-accelerate-demise-of-postal-service/,Lawmakers warn ‘onerous’ new USPS loan terms imposed by Mnuchin ‘could accelerate demise of Postal Service’,"Leading congressional Democrats are warning that an emergency loan agreement announced Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy—a major donor to President Donald Trump and the GOP—could “accelerate the demise of the Postal Service” by giving the administration unprecedented access to the popular agency’s internal operations.
“Secretary Mnuchin and the leadership of the U.S. Postal Service appear to be exploiting this public health pandemic to hold the Postal Service to unreasonable loan terms without even consulting Congress,” said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), and Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) in a joint statement Wednesday evening.
According to a loan term sheet (pdf) made public by the lawmakers, the USPS will gain access to $10 billion in emergency funding approved by Congress back in March provided that the agency adheres to a number of requirements, including providing the Trump administration with “historical and protected business, financial, operational, contractual, and planning data that Treasury may determine is necessary to evaluate USPS’s current and future financial condition.”
The agreement also requires USPS to give the Treasury Department access to proprietary information about the Postal Service’s private-sector shipping contracts and bars the agency from accessing the emergency funds if its “cash balance exceeds $8 billion.”
In a statement, Mnuchin hailed the deal as a step in the direction of “the president’s goal of establishing a sustainable business model under which USPS can continue to provide necessary mail service for all Americans, without shifting costs to taxpayers.” In April, Trump called the USPS a “joke” and demanded that it dramatically hike package prices amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused a sharp decline in mail volume.
Maloney, Peters, Connolly, and Carper said Wednesday that the terms agreed upon by Mnuchin and DeJoy—who took over as head of the USPS just last month—”would inappropriately insert the Treasury into the internal operations of the Postal Service.”
“These terms would severely limit the Postal Service’s access to capital and could accelerate the demise of the Postal Service that all Americans, especially seniors, small businesses, veterans, and those living in rural communities, rely upon every day, especially during the pandemic,” the lawmakers said. “We will not stop fighting to protect this critical service that communities depend on and to ensure that every American can safely participate in the November elections.”
The new loan agreement comes as DeJoy continues to rush ahead with sweeping operational changes at the USPS that postal workers believe are part of a deliberate effort to sabotage the beloved government institution and put it on a path toward privatization—a longtime goal of the conservative movement.
Last week, as Common Dreams reported, USPS leadership launched a pilot program that could result in significant delays in mail delivery by barring postal workers from sorting packages during their morning operations. In Portland, Maine, letter carriers allege they are being instructed to delay first-class parcels in order to prioritize Amazon packages.
“Undermining and degrading the Postal Service helps frustrate the customer, which sets the stage to privatizing it,” Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, told The Intercept. “The Trump administration is on record for raising prices, reducing service, and reducing workers’ rights and benefits.”
Motherboard reported Monday that “post offices around the country are slashing their hours—including during the busiest times of day—with little notice as yet another abrupt cost-saving measure” implemented by DeJoy, previously the CEO of New Breed Logistics, a private firm with a history of union-busting activity.
“In addition to West Virginia and New Jersey, post offices in Berkeley, California; Petersburg, Alaska, Youngstown, Ohio, and Knoxville, Tennessee have announced similar plans to reduce hours,” Motherboard reported. “All of the changes Motherboard has reviewed were announced only by signs hanging on the post office doors.”
In addition to harming the credibility of the USPS—which ranks as the most popular government agency in the United States—DeJoy’s cost-cutting measures also threaten to disrupt upcoming elections as an record number of Americans turn to vote-by-mail as the safest way to cast their ballots amid the pandemic.
“The Trump administration’s attempts to politicize, privatize, and gut USPS in the middle of a pandemic and unprecedented vote-by-mail is one of the biggest scandals in American politics right now,” Mother Jones reporter Ari Berman tweeted Wednesday.
In an op-ed for NJ.com this week, Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.) warned that “the electoral implications for the destruction of the Postal Service are momentous.”
“If it is forced to curtail its service,” Pascrell wrote, “our ability to hold a national election could be obliterated.”

0,2020-07-30T10:31:29+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/president-trump-admits-what-we-all-already-knew-fox-news-is-not-even-watchable/,President Trump admits what we all already knew: Fox News is ‘not even watchable’,"President Donald Trump lashed out at Fox News in a context-free tweet Wednesday, calling the network “not even watchable” while at the same time taking personal credit for its success.
“I was on Air Force One flying to the Great State of Texas, where I just landed,” the president began his tweet. “It is AMAZING in watching @FoxNews how different they are from four years ago. Not even watchable. They totally forgot who got them where they are!”
Trump deleted an earlier version of the tweet in which he had attempted to tag Air Force One. However, the famous airplane, which has carried Trump to destinations around the world for more than three years, does not have its own Twitter account.
The president erroneously tagged an eponymous Ohio heating and air conditioning company. That company, Air Force One, received between $2 million and $5 million in federal emergency loans designed to help small businesses retain jobs during the coronavirus pandemic. The company reported putting the funds toward 204 jobs.
Trump appears to have increasingly soured on Fox News, whose polls do not reflect the political reality of winning he espouses. The president has chastised the network for dumping far-right pundits Diamond & Silk. He previously warned his followers that the network was “on a bad path,” instead directing them towards alternative right-wing outlets.
“Fox News weekend afternoons is the worst!” he tweeted earlier this month. “Getting into @CNN and MSDNC territory. Watch @OANN & @newsmax instead. Much better!”
The president similarly lashed out at Fox News after a network poll showed Biden up 14 points nationwide last month.
“Many will disagree, but Fox News is doing nothing to help Republicans, and me, get re-elected on November 3rd,” Trump complained in May.
In April, the president attacked Fox reporters during two coronavirus briefings within days of each other. In February, he blasted multiple network shows and personalities for critical coverage. On Jan. 28, Trump tweeted that Fox News was “really pathetic” and “so politically correct” after anchor Chris Wallace discussed impeachment with Democrat Chris Van Hollen.
On April 11, Trump called the weekend programming on Fox News “a total waste of time,” and plugged the even further afield One America News Network (OANN) as an alternative. In December, he seemed to take a shot at Fox by retweeting an apparent jab at the network’s sluggish confirmation of a story broken by OANN. The tweet was later deleted, apparently because it was inaccurate.
But Trump has recently hyped the network, as well. Earlier this month, he bragged that Fox beat CNN in the ratings thanks to “President Trump.” He also appeared to have bitten much of his divisive Fourth of July speech at Mount Rushmore from host Tucker Carlson’s monologues.
However, in 2015 Trump also tweeted that he could no longer watch Fox News:
And he has specifically said he would no longer watch former network anchor Megyn Kelly:
Here are some other things Trump has called “unwatchable” over the years, including the Emmy Awards, the procedural drama “Law & Order,” the late-night sketch comedy show “Saturday Night Live,” a slew of late-night talk show hosts, Fox News competitors CNN and MSNBC, former New York Yankees star infielder Alex Rodriguez and — twice within a month of losing his bid to buy the Buffalo Bills — the National Football League.

But one tweet, in particular, caught some observers’ eyes and stood out from the rest.
Trump retweeted the following post from the Washington Times:
Unlike much of the propaganda the president usually shares, this piece was sharply critical of his administration. In the op-ed, Andrew Napolitano excoriated the president’s federal troops and their treatment of civilians in Portland, Oregon:
Last weekend, with no notice or local consent, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent teams of agents — untrained in crowd control and wearing military fatigues — onto Portland’s streets. Their uniforms bore no governmental, administrative or personal names, just the word “Police” on masking tape. They descended upon the city in unmarked SUVs and began grabbing people indiscriminately off the streets, without regard to the person’s lawful presence or personal behavior.
According to the account of one victim, he was walking peacefully in the downtown area, observing the chaos, when five masked men in fatigues exited an unmarked SUV, grabbed him and pulled him into the car. They tied his hands with plastic behind his back. They pulled his cap over his face. They kept him for two hours and then released him. They filed no charges against him.
They had no basis for this kidnapping.
It was a kidnapping, not an arrest. An arrest is a lawful restraint by a legitimate government authority pursuant to a warrant issued by a judge specifically naming the person to be arrested, or pursuant to probable cause of crime personally observed by the arresting officers. Neither of these was the case in Portland.
And some victims were even less fortunate than those kidnapped. They were assaulted with pepper spray and hit with nonlethal exploding bullets that stun, hurt and disorient. The bullets can harm the eyes, heart and liver. I saw a video of a young man riding a bicycle away from the chaos. Yet, he was attacked by five of these feds.
Napolitano tied these actions directly to Trump, noting: “On Monday, the DHS acknowledged that these thugs are its police and said their behavior somehow will bring stability to downtown Portland. The phrase that Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf used — mimicking his boss — was ‘law and order.'”
He concluded: “This is how totalitarianism begins. The feds claim that federal property needs protection and the folks assigned to do so need help. When help arrives, it does so by surprise, under cover of darkness and shielded by anonymity. Then, the reinforcements beat and arrest and harm protesters because their bosses in Washington do not approve of the protesters’ message.”
It was a harsh, persuasive diatribe about the present administration. So why did the president share it?
It’s possible had no idea what he was doing. He may have misunderstood the headline and not read the article. It’s not clear if there’s anyone in the White House who would notice or attempt to correct the president for mistakenly sharing a tweet.
But there’s another disturbing possibility. The president might have shared the story knowingly, on purpose. It is, after all, still on his Twitter feed at the time of this writing, hours after he first shared it. Perhaps he shared it as a warning or a threat. He likes being seen as a strongman. He may have seen Napolitano’s sharp denunciation of his authoritarian tactics and thought: “This is someone who gets me.”

0,2020-07-30T01:28:04+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/we-will-coup-whoever-we-want-elon-musk-and-the-overthrow-of-democracy-in-bolivia/,‘We will coup whoever we want’: Elon Musk and the overthrow of democracy in Bolivia,"On July 24, 2020, Tesla’s Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that a second U.S. “government stimulus package is not in the best interests of the people.” Someone responded to Musk soon after, “You know what wasn’t in the best interest of people? The U.S. government organizing a coup against Evo Morales in Bolivia so you could obtain the lithium there.” Musk then wrote: “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.”
Musk refers here to the coup against President Evo Morales Ayma, who was removed illegally from his office in November 2019. Morales had just won an election for a term that was to have begun in January 2020. Even if there was a challenge against that election, Morales’ term should rightfully have continued through November and December of 2019. Instead, the Bolivian military, at the behest of Bolivia’s far right and the United States government, threatened Morales; Morales went into exile in Mexico and is now in Argentina.
At that time, the “evidence” of fraud was offered by the far right and by a “preliminary report” by the Organization of American States; only after Morales was removed from office was there grudging acknowledgment by the liberal media that there was in fact no evidence of fraud. It was too late for Bolivia, which has been condemned to a dangerous government that has suspended democracy in the country.
Lithium Coup
Over his 14 years in office, Morales fought to use the wealth of Bolivia for the Bolivian people, who saw—after centuries of oppression—remarkable advances in their basic needs. Literacy rates rose and hunger rates dropped. The use of Bolivia’s wealth to advance the interests of the people rather than North American multinational corporations was an abomination to the U.S. embassy in La Paz, which had egged on the worst elements of the military and the far right to overthrow the government. This is just what happened in November 2019.
Musk’s admission, however intemperate, is at least honest. His company Tesla has long wanted access at a low price to the large lithium deposits in Bolivia; lithium is a key ingredient for batteries. Earlier this year, Musk and his company revealed that they wanted to build a Tesla factory in Brazil, which would be supplied by lithium from Bolivia; when we wrote about that we called our report “Elon Musk Is Acting Like a Neo-Conquistador for South America’s Lithium.” Everything we wrote there is condensed in his new tweet: the arrogance toward the political life of other countries, and the greed toward resources that people like Musk think are their entitlement.
Musk went on to delete his tweet. He then said, “we get our lithium from Australia”; this will not settle the issue, since eyebrows are being raised in Australia regarding the environmental damage from lithium mining.
Suspension of Democracy
After Morales was removed, an insignificant far-right politician named Jeanine Áñez set aside the constitutional process and seized power. She showed the character of her politics when she signed a presidential decree on November 15, 2019, that gave the military the right to do whatever it wanted; even her allies found this to be too far and repealed it on November 28.
Arrests and intimidation of activists from the Movement for Socialism (MAS)—the party of Morales—began in November 2019 and still continue. On July 7, 2020, seven U.S. senators published a statement that said, “We are increasingly concerned by the growing number of human rights violations and curtailments of civil liberties by the interim government of Bolivia.” “Without a change in course by the interim government,” the senators wrote, “we fear that basic civil rights in Bolivia will be further eroded and the legitimacy of the crucial upcoming elections will be put at risk.”
There’s no need to worry about that, since the government of Áñez seems unwilling to hold an election. By all polls, Áñez looks likely to be defeated in the general elections. A recent poll by El Centro Estratégico Latinoamericano de Geopolítica (CELAG) says that Áñez will get a mere 13.3 percent, far behind the Movement for Socialism’s Luis Arce (41.9 percent) and the center right’s Carlos Mesa (26.8 percent). The election was supposed to have taken place in May, but it was rescheduled for September 6; it has now been postponed once more, this time to October 18. Bolivia would not have had an elected government for an entire year.
Luis Arce of MAS recently told Oliver Vargas, “We face persecution, we face surveillance… we are facing a very difficult campaign.” But, he said, “we are sure that we will win these elections.” If elections are permitted.
The CELAG study shows that 9 out of 10 Bolivians have seen their incomes decline due to the coronavirus recession. Because of this—and of the attack by this government on the MAS—65.2 percent of Bolivians have a negative appraisal of Áñez. It is important to note that due to the positive policies of Morales’ MAS, there is widespread support for a socialist orientation; 64.1 percent of Bolivians support taxes against the rich, and Bolivians in general support the resource socialism of the MAS and Morales.
CoronaShock and Bolivia
The government of Áñez has been utterly incompetent regarding the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in this country of 11 million people is 66,456; since testing is low, the number is likely much higher.
Musk returns to our story. Earlier this year, on March 31, Bolivia’s Foreign Minister Karen Longaric wrote an obsequious letter to Musk asking him about the “offer of cooperation posted by you regarding ventilators ready to be dispatched to countries where they are needed the most.” Longaric said, “If it is not possible to send it to Bolivia, we can arrange its receipt in Miami, FL. and transport them from there as quickly as possible.” No such ventilators came.
Instead, the government bought ventilators from a Spanish supplier for $27,000 for each of the 170 devices; Bolivian producers had said they could supply ventilators for $1,000 per unit. The health minister in the Áñez government—Marcelo Navajas—was arrested for this scandal.
Morales
Evo Morales read Musk’s tweet about the coup in Bolivia and responded: “Elon Musk, the owner of the largest electric car company, says about the coup in Bolivia: ‘We will coup whoever we want.’ Another proof that the coup was about Bolivian lithium; at the cost of two massacres. We will always defend our resources!”
The reference to the massacres is important. In November, from Mexico City, Morales watched as the government of Áñez let loose the dogs of war against the people of Bolivia from Cochabamba to El Alto. “They are killing my brothers and sisters,” Morales said at a press conference. “This is the kind of thing the old military dictatorships used to do.” It is the toxic character of the government of Áñez, backed fully by the U.S. government and Elon Musk.
Protests across Bolivia began on July 27 for the restoration of democracy.

It will come as a shock to no one other than the most credulous:
Reality TV isn’t real! A pearl-clutching revelation, I realize.
Professionally and socially, I know people who have written reality programming, who have produced it, who have edited it. The reality is a fantasy. Yes, real people are the characters but plotlines are formatted to fit the agreed-upon story, all the boring parts are edited out, events are juggled around to present characters in the most entertaining light, for good or evil.
Ultimate case in point: Donald Trump became a reality TV star—and president—by pretending to be something he is not, a self-made decisive billionaire with more business acumen than Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Warren Buffett combined.
Instead, reading his niece Mary L. Trump’s heartbreaking new memoir, Too Much and Never Enough, he’s revealed as a man filled with fear and insecurity who from childhood has lashed out with cruelty and prevarication at the least challenge and whose boasts of financial empire were built on the million and millions given to him by his father and a web of fraud, tax evasion, and bankruptcy that one day finally will be exposed for all to see.
“Honest work was never demanded of him,” Mary Trump writes, “and no matter how badly he failed, he was rewarded in ways that are almost unfathomable. He continues to be protected from his own disasters in the White House, where a claque of loyalists applauds his every pronouncement or covers up his possible criminal negligence by normalizing it to the point that we’ve become almost numb to the accumulating transgressions. But now the stakes are far higher than they’ve ever been before; they are literally life or death. Unlike any previous time in his life, Donald’s failings cannot be hidden or ignored because they threaten us all.”
Mark Burnett, executive producer of The Apprentice, molded a willing Trump into a realty TV monster from the Planet Television, the place where nothing “real” is real. As per Mary Trump, when the show began in 2004, “Donald’s finances were a mess… and his own ‘empire’ consisted of increasingly desperate branding opportunities such as Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka and Trump University… The Apprentice… despite all evidence to the contrary, presented him as a legitimately successful tycoon.”
An editor on the show said, “Most of us knew he was a fake. He had just gone through I don’t know how many bankruptcies. But we made him out to be the most important person in the world. It was like making the court jester the king.”
We know from other reporting that the editors often had to “reverse engineer” episodes of the series when Trump impulsively changed his mind in the middle of shooting and a scramble ensued to undo the damage. Katherine Walker, one of the producers, told Patrick Radden Keefe of The New Yorker, in a 2018 profile of Burnett, that they often “struggled to make Trump seem coherent, editing out garbled syntax and malapropisms. ‘We cleaned it up so that he was his best self,’ she said, adding, ‘I’m sure Donald thinks that he was never edited.’
However, she acknowledged, he was a natural for the medium: whereas reality-TV producers generally must amp up personalities and events, to accentuate conflict and conjure intrigue, “we didn’t have to change him—he gave us stuff to work with.”
I’ll bet. His profane gift for manipulation and dissembling was further nurtured and encouraged at The Apprentice and now the nation and world suffer. Lashing out, in fear of losing reelection, he’s used the lessons he learned from reality TV to mean and violent effect in Portland.
“Welcome to the world of performative authoritarianism,” The Atlantic’s estimable Anne Applebaum writes, “a form of politics that reached new heights of sophistication in Russia over the past decade and has now arrived in the United States. Unlike 20th-century authoritarianism, this 21st-century, postmodern influence campaign does not require the creation of a total police state. Nor does it require complete control of information, or mass arrests. It can be carried out, instead, with a few media outlets and a few carefully targeted arrests…
On Fox News, Sean Hannity has already denounced Portland as a “war zone.” Tucker Carlson has spoken of protesters as “mobs” who keep liberal Democrats in power. The next stage will implicate Joe Biden in this same story: The president’s aides have told journalists that Biden, if he wins, will “allow left-wing fascists to destroy America.” Protesters, mobs, chaos, fascists, the left, the “Dems,” Biden—they’re all one narrative. The Trump administration will show people pictures of its uniformed troops pushing back against them, restoring order with a strong hand. And it will use the kind of language that appeals to that part of the population that prizes safety over all else.
This all is meant as talking points for right-wing TV and radio and for Trump’s campaign ads, and as a diversion from 150,000 COVID deaths (although it also may be a dress rehearsal for election trouble in November). Some say he’s trying to scare suburban voters leaning toward Biden as Richard Nixon did in 1968 following urban uprisings after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the police riot in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention. Others, including Amy Walter of The Cook Report and the PBS NewsHour, think it’s more about stiffening the spine of his faltering base.
She notes a Kaiser Family Foundation poll that that from May to July, Trump job approval among Republicans has dropped across the board: down 12 points on job approval, ten on the economy and a “whopping” 26 points on coronavirus. Walters tweets, “Is getting his base back enough for him to win the race? Probably not. He’s got to win back independents who’ve also soured on him. BUT, it sure would help GOP SEN candidates in IA, KS and Montana to have R voters come home.”
So now the Trump administration has agreed to begin withdrawing the Feds from Portland on Thursday if state and local law enforcement secure Federal buildings and assuming conditions “significantly improve”—this despite Trump’s claim Thursday morning, “We’re not leaving until they’ve secured their city.”
Regardless, he knows he already has the footage he needs to for what he thinks will help him most. A handful of protesters late at night made noise and trouble with lasers, bottles and fire in a small area around the courthouse even though the vastest majority of ongoing demonstrations in Portland have been peaceful, as moms, dads and veterans march in support of Black Lives Matter and against the Federal presence on Portland’s streets.
On Trump’s behalf, Attorney General Barr and acting Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf will keep haranguing the aforementioned credulous (unfortunately, they have a lot of votes) with bogus claims that the placid streets of Portland were overrun with anarchists—or denying there’s systemic racism among the police. The Federal dollars spent on military gear and personnel for use against American civilians should instead be going to cures for an ailing populace and an economy crippled by virus in which millions are devastated by poverty and a lack of food, housing and education.
“Perhaps most crucially, for Donald, there is no value in empathy, no tangible upside to caring for other people,” Mary Trump observes in Too Much and Never Enough. “… This is another crisis in which it would have been so easy for Donald to triumph, but his ignorance overwhelms his ability to turn to his advantage the third national catastrophe to occur on his watch. An effective response would have entailed a call for unity, but Donald requires division. It is the only way he knows how to survive.”
That’s the reality. There’s many a good reason her book is subtitled “How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man.”

Over 100 children, who are currently detained in facilities that Judge Dolly Gee herself said are “on fire” due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, remain detained past her deadline because her order was now apparently “unenforceable,” NBC News’ Julia Ainsley and Jacob Soboroff explained.
“Judge Dolly Gee of the Central District of California said Saturday that the conditions she laid out in June as prerequisites for releasing the children from detention over COVID-19 concerns had not been met,” the report said. “Namely, the children’s parents had not agreed to release them, Immigration and Customs Enforcement had not agreed to release parents with their children, and another court with jurisdiction over the parents had not ordered their release.”
As advocates like immigration attorney Amy Maldonado have said, none of this has to be happening. “They could let people out tomorrow,” told Mother Jones. “They could have let people out six months ago.” Yet the Trump administration has been steadfastly against releasing children and their parents together, which is the right thing to do.
Instead, as Prism’s Tina Vasquez has reported, officials have been looking toward forcing a “binary choice” on parents that’s no choice at all: “The protocol will force parents detained alongside their children during the pandemic to choose between remaining detained in unsafe facilities where a deadly virus is spreading, or sending their children away to live with sponsors,” she wrote.
As BuzzFeed News reported earlier this month, officials may still proceed with their inhumane plan in spite of medical experts hired by the administration itself loudly warning about the traumatic effects of family separation on kids and their parents.
“That ICE is considering repeating one of the darkest moments of this administration—separating children from their families—knowing this will cause serious medical and psychological harm to children is nothing less than willful endangerment,” Dana Gold, an attorney at the Government Accountability Project who represents the experts, told BuzzFeed News. “That DHS’s own medical and mental health experts need to speak up to try to prevent this agency from inflicting imminent harm on innocent children is another grotesque example of the government ignoring its medical experts.”
ICE has insisted conditions inside facilities are safe when we know that ICE has misled the public when it comes to the pandemic. ICE’s tally of COVID-19 among detention facility employees lists only 45 confirmed cases; that number is so low because the agency isn’t counting contracted workers. In reality, more than 900 detention staffers have tested positive. “Forty-seven cases of the virus have been documented at the Karnes family detention center and one at the Dilley detention center, both located in Texas,” Mother Jones reported. “And lawyers say their clients still aren’t being adequately protected.”
What happens next to these children is unclear, and even a former Department of Homeland Security official tells Ainsley and Soboroff that what the Trump administration is doing—or refusing to do, rather—is intentional brutality: “‘It’s preposterous,’ said a former ICE official who served during both the Obama and Trump administrations. ‘There’s no reason other than cruelty.’”

0,2020-07-29T23:52:54+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/white-supremacists-are-using-the-protests-to-stoke-racial-tensions-while-trump-and-bill-barr-help/,White supremacists are using the protests to stoke racial tensions — while Trump and Bill Barr help,"The day after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers, peaceful protesters took to the streets. But the first serious incidence of violence came two days later on May 27th when a masked man started breaking windows at an auto parts store.
That set off a chain reaction of looting, fires, and rioting. Three days later, Attorney General Bill Barr made a statement, saying that “In many places it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and far left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from outside the state to promote the violence.” The president echoed those remarks.
On Tuesday, we learned something about the so-called “umbrella man” in the video above.
A masked man who was seen in a viral video smashing the windows of a south Minneapolis auto parts store during the George Floyd protests, earning him the moniker “Umbrella Man,” is suspected to be a member of the Hell’s Angels biker gang seeking to incite racial tension in a demonstration that until then had been peaceful, police said…
A subsequent investigation revealed that the man was also an associate of the Aryan Cowboy Brotherhood, a small white supremacist prison and street gang based primarily in Minnesota and Kentucky.
Police have also connected the Aryan Cowboy Brotherhood to an incident in which a Muslim woman and her daughter were harassed in Stillwater, Minnesota by a group of men wearing white supremacist insignia.
Last weekend, something similar happened in Richmond, Virginia.
Riots in downtown Richmond over the weekend were instigated by white supremacists under the guise of Black Lives Matter, according to law enforcement officials.
Protesters tore down police tape and pushed forward toward Richmond police headquarters, where they set a city dump truck on fire.
If we add all of that to the involvement of the far-right anti-government group Boogaloo Boys, it becomes clear that much of the violence we’re seeing on the streets is coming from two groups: (1) law enforcement, and (2) far-right/white supremacist groups. But as the president and attorney general defend the use of force by law enforcement to “dominate” the streets, it is significant that neither one of them has called out the actual extremists who are involved.

0,2020-07-29T23:35:40+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/one-moment-in-bill-barrs-testimony-clearly-exposed-his-compete-fealty-to-trumps-delusion-and-lies/,One moment in Bill Barr’s testimony clearly exposed his compete fealty to Trump’s delusion and lies,"Attorney General Bill Barr finally showed up for his long-scheduled hearing before the House Judiciary Committee and once again proved himself to be Trump’s eager henchman. He didn’t read aloud some of the more incendiary parts of his opening statement (which as Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., observed, “reads like it was written by Alex Jones or Roger Stone”) but for all his braying about “the law” his arrogant attitude and slippery answers left no doubt about where his allegiance lies. Let’s just say Trump doesn’t have to worry about Barr’s loyalty.
The list of Barr’s odious comments is a mile long, starting with his fatuous answers regarding the question of systemic racism in policing. He evidently thinks it’s cute, just as his boss does, to insist that “more white people are shot by police than Black people” when responding to the question of why Black people, who make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population, account for 25 percent of those shot and killed by police since 2015 while “non-Hispanic” whites, who are more than 60 percent of the population, only account for 45 percent. This answer is insulting to the intelligence of the American people.
Barr also obfuscated, dissembled, misled and evaded questions about his interference in cases on behalf of Trump’s cronies, the firing and reassigning of U.S. attorneys working on cases involving the president, the shocking events at Lafayette Square in June and his inconsistency in applying federal laws to benefit the president, while ignoring them when they don’t. As hard as it is to believe, he even took it upon himself to strenuously defend the president’s botched COVID-19 response in great detail, something he could have easily avoided by saying it isn’t his purview.
But no, Barr had the temerity to use some of Trump’s most spectacularly absurd excuses by blaming the Obama administration, which hasn’t been in office for three and a half years, for allegedly destroying the CDC and failing to replenish the national stockpile of PPE. If there was one moment that captured Barr’s total immersion in Trump’s ocean of self-deception and lies, it was that series of inane talking points.
There is a whole lot to worry about with what Barr is doing right now, not the least of which is covering up Trump’s corruption and pushing paramilitary responses against peaceful protests. But after listening to his testimony, I think it’s the potential for direct interference in the presidential election by Barr and the Justice Department that should have every American on high alert.
Consider that Barr’s opening statement referred to the Russia investigation as “bogus,” ignoring the fact that, among other things, Robert Mueller and multiple House and Senate committees have established that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on behalf of Donald Trump. This would also indicate that Barr is completely unconcerned about another propaganda or hacking campaign happening as we speak, despite repeated warnings from the FBI the U.S. intelligence agencies and Congress.
That just isn’t something the attorney general of the United States cares about. When asked if it was OK to solicit or accept foreign assistance in an election campaign, he even responded, Indeed, he even went so far as to answer, “It depends what kind of assistance.” He caught himself, so when he was asked the same question again he said, “No.” It’s a felony, after all. But I think it’s pretty clear that he believes when Trump asks for assistance from Russia, Ukraine and China — all of which we’ve seen him do publicly — it is just fine.
On the other hand, Barr has invented out of whole cloth a new concern that hostile governments will alter the election results by “manufacturing mail-in ballots,” citing zero actual evidence but rather his “common sense” as proof. That’s because there is no evidence. Many states provide no-excuse absentee ballots and five states have total vote by mail. Oregon, for instance, has done it since 1998, without any hint of such a problem.
Earlier in the hearing, Barr had made it clear that he sent federal troops into Portland because protesters were harming a federal building. When asked why he had backed the right of armed protesters who stormed the Michigan state capitol, some of whom threatened the governor with lynching and beheading, he claimed not to have been aware of that and mumbled something about defending religious freedom. He indicated that he’s only concerned with federal offenses.
Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., pointed out that Trump has suggested that no ballots should be counted after Election Day and asked Barr, “If the president asks you to intervene and try to stop states from counting legal ballots after Election Day, will you do the right thing and refuse?”
Barr responded, “I will follow the law.” He separately said he would “enforce” the law. So that means if a state has issued a ruling saying that votes cannot be counted if they were postmarked before Election Day but didn’t arrive until after that, he would be willing to intervene on behalf of the president to ensure those votes weren’t counted.
Anyone who lived through the Florida 2000 election debacle should know that this is not a matter for federal law enforcement. Elections are run by the states. If there’s a dispute it goes to the courts and in a worst-case scenario to the Congress. Barr has no authority to intervene at all in how states count and tabulate their votes, but judging from his recent behavior, I doubt that would stop him. With Barr, “follow the law,” seems to mean “do whatever benefits Donald Trump and hurts his enemies.”
When Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., asked Barr whether he had discussed the presidential campaign with Trump, the attorney general said he couldn’t talk about his private conversations but blithely admitted that they talk about the campaign in Cabinet meetings and said nobody should be surprised that the election comes up. Actually, they should be both surprised and alarmed. The AG is supposed to be the most removed from politics of all high-level administration officials and neither the president nor anyone else should not be talking to him about the campaign or the election. (You may recall the furious rending of garments on the right when Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton for 15 minutes in 2016.)
Perhaps most chilling was Barr’s answer to Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who asked whether Barr himself would leave office on Jan. 20, 2021, if Trump loses the election but tries to remain in the White House. “Well, if the results are clear, I would leave office,” the attorney general said. He did not elaborate further, but considering that the president is already saying that mail-in voting will somehow “rig” the election, something Barr claims to believe is thoroughly possible, his unwillingness to simply say that he would leave office if Trump loses is more than a little bit disturbing.
When Nadler asked Barr whether he had ever discussed the presidential campaign with Trump he also asked whether they had discussed the “current or future deployment of federal law enforcement” within the context of Trump’s re-election campaign. Barr answered, “I’m not going to get into my discussions with the president.”
It would have been completely acceptable for him to simply say no to such an explosive suggestion. You have to wonder why he didn’t.

0,2020-07-29T22:43:37+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-consequences-of-inequality-can-be-fatal/,The consequences of inequality can be fatal,"Capitalism, as Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century shows, relentlessly worsens wealth and income inequalities. That inherent tendency is only occasionally stopped or reversed when masses of people rise up against it. That happened, for example, in western Europe and the U.S. during the 1930s Great Depression. It prompted social democracy in Europe and the New Deal in the United States. So far in capitalism’s history, however, stoppages or reversals around the world proved temporary. The last half-century witnessed a neoliberal reaction that rolled back both European social democracy and the New Deal. Capitalism has always managed to resume its tendential movement toward greater inequality.
Among the consequences of a system with such a tendency, many are awful. We are living through one now as the COVID-19 pandemic, inadequately contained by the U.S. system, savages Americans of middle and lower incomes and wealth markedly more than the rich. The rich buy better health care and diets, second homes away from crowded cities, better connections to get government bailouts, and so on. Many of the poor are homeless. Tasteless advice to “shelter at home” is, for them, absurd. Low-income people are often crowded into the kinds of dense housing and dense working conditions that facilitate infection. Poor residents of low-cost nursing homes die disproportionally, as do prison inmates (mostly poor). Pandemic capitalism distributes death in inverse proportion to wealth and income.
Social distancing has destroyed especially low-wage service sector jobs. Rarely did top executives lose their positions, and when they did, they found others. The result is a widened gap between high salaries for some and low or no wages for many. Unemployment invites employers to lower wages for the still employed because they can. Pandemic capitalism has provoked a massive increase in money-creation by central banks. That money fuels rising stock markets and thereby enriches the rich who own most shares. The coincidence of rising stock markets and mass unemployment plus falling wages only adds momentum to worsening inequality.
Unequal economic distributions (of income and wealth) finance unequal political outcomes. Whenever a small minority enjoys concentrated wealth within a society committed to universal suffrage, the rich quickly understand their vulnerability. The non-wealthy majority can use universal suffrage to prevail politically. The majority’s political power could then undo the results of the economy including its unequal distribution of income and wealth. The rich corrupt politics with their money to prevent exactly that outcome. Capitalists spend part of their wealth to preserve (and enlarge) all of their wealth.
The rich and those eager to join them in the U.S. dominate within both Republican and Democratic parties. The rich provide most of the donations that sustain candidates and parties, the funding for armies of lobbyists “advising” legislators, the bribes, and many issue-oriented public campaigns. The laws and regulations that flow from Washington, states, and cities reflect the needs and desires of the rich far more than those of the rest of us. The peculiar structure of U.S. property taxes offers an example. In the U.S., property is divided into two kinds: tangible and intangible. Tangible property includes land, buildings, business inventories, automobiles, etc. Intangible property is mostly stocks and bonds. Rich people hold most of their wealth in the form of intangible property. It is thus remarkable that in the U.S., only tangible property is subject to property tax. Intangible property is not subject to any property tax.
The kinds of property (tangible) that many people own get taxed, but the kinds of property (intangible) mostly owned by the richest minority do not get taxed. If you own a house rented to tenants, you pay a property tax to the municipality where the house is located. You also pay an income tax on the received rents to the federal government and likely also the state government where you live. You are thus taxed twice: once on the value of the property you own and once on the income you derive from that property. If you sell a $100,000 house and then buy $100,000 worth of shares, you will owe no property taxes to any level of government in the United States. You will only owe income tax on dividends paid to you on the shares you own. The form of property you own determines whether you pay property tax or not.
This property tax system is excellent for those rich enough to buy significant amounts of shares. The rich used their wealth to get tax laws written that way for them. The rest of us pay more in taxes because the rich pay less. Because the rich save money—since their intangible property is not taxed—they have that much more to buy the politicians who secure such a tax system for them. And that tax system worsens inequality of wealth and income.
Unequal economic distributions finance unequal cultural outcomes. For example, the goal of a unifying, democratizing public school system has always been subverted by economic inequality. In general (with few exceptions), the better schools cost more to attend. The tutors needed to help struggling students are affordable for the rich but less so for everyone else. The children of the wealthy get the private schools, books, quiet rooms, computers, educational trips, extra art and music lessons, and virtually everything else needed for higher educational achievement.
Unequal economic distributions finance unequal “natural” outcomes. The U.S. now displays two differently priced foods. Rich people can afford “organic” while the rest of us worry but still buy “conventional” food for budget reasons. Countless studies indicate the dangers of herbicides, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, food processing methods, and additives. Nonetheless, the two-price food system delivers the better, safer food more to the rich than to everyone else. Likewise, the rich buy the safer automobiles, more safely equip their homes, and clean and filter the water they drink and the air they breathe. No wonder the rich live years longer on average than other people. Inequality is often fatal, not just during pandemics.
In ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle worried about and discussed the threat to community, to social cohesion, posed by inequalities of wealth and income. They criticized markets as institutions because, in their view, markets facilitated and aggravated income and wealth inequalities. But modern capitalism sanctifies markets and has thus conveniently forgotten Plato’s and Aristotle’s cautions and warnings about markets and inequality.
The thousands of years since Plato and Aristotle have seen countless critiques, reforms, and revolutions directed against wealth and income inequalities. They have rarely succeeded and have even more rarely persisted. Pessimists have responded, as the Bible does, with the notion that “the poor shall always be with us.” We rather ask the question: Why did so many heroic efforts at equality fail?
The answer concerns the economic system, and how it organizes the people who work to produce and distribute the goods and services societies depend on. If its economic organization splits participants into a small rich minority and a large non-rich majority, the former will likely be determined to reproduce that organization over time. Slavery (master versus slave) did; feudalism (lord versus serf) did; and capitalism (employer versus employee) does. Inequality in the economy is a root cause contributing to society-wide inequalities.
We might then infer that an alternative economic system based on a democratically organized community producing goods and services—not split into a dominant minority and a subordinate majority—might finally end social inequality.

Jim Jordan yells and throws a hearing into chaos over his ‘fringe conspiracy theories’,"Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) threw the entire House Judiciary Committee’s hearing with four of the top big tech CEOs into a three-ring circus on Wednesday when Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) opened her five-minute allotment of questioning by appearing to suggest he is a conspiracy theorist.
“I’d like to direct your attention to anti-trust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,” Congresswoman Scanlon declared.
Congressman Jordan, both maskless and jacketless, broke House decorum by interrupting his colleague, and by shouting: “Mr. Chairman, we have the email – there is no fringe conspiracy –”
Chairman Cicilline moved to restore order.
“Mr. Jordan you do not have the time,” the Democrat from Rhode Island announced. “Please be respectful of your colleague. She controls the time.”
The camera, focused on Rep. Scanlon, shows her putting her mask back on as Jordan upended the hearing.
Another Congressman repeatedly demanded Jordan to “put your mask on.”
Jordan, as Politico adds, used the reference to masks “to bring up the ‘unmasking’ — in the surveillance sense — of former Trump White House national security adviser Michael Flynn.”
“When someone comes after my motives for asking questions, I get a chance to respond,” Jordan demanded.

0,2020-07-29T21:08:31+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-pandemic-botchery-must-be-his-undoing/,Trump’s pandemic botchery must be his undoing,"Donald Trump has willfully botched our national response to this pandemic. We have lost over 150,000 American lives over the past five months and all Trump can say is, “We are in the process of developing a strategy.”
Another lie. Trump’s plan has been in plain view from the very beginning: to deny, to scapegoat, to gaslight, and to kill.
Trump decided early on that losing American lives to COVID-19 was palatable and even preferable to acknowledging the devastating and deadly force of this pandemic. He did not want his re-election chances to be hurt by an economic downturn due to the virus. So, in January and February Trump did not heed at least 12 warnings from governmental agencies about the impending pandemic. His public statements to us were dismissive mistruths: “We have it totally under control,” “It’s going to be just fine,” and “Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus…this is their new hoax.”
Trump was warned about the worldwide pandemic, but he responded reflexively by focusing on his own political calculations, not the country’s welfare.
Trump further botched the pandemic by announcing that the federal government would be “backup” to the states’ efforts. In other words, there was not going to be a formal national strategy for fending off and defeating the worst pandemic in 100 years. Each governor was left alone to compete with one another for PPE’s, ventilators, testing kits, money, and other necessities. It was chaotic and confusing and a recipe for catastrophic failure.
Yet Trump wanted to take credit and receive praise for his oversight during that time. He bragged that he was the “King of Ventilators.” He claimed that “anybody that wants a test can get a test.” He boasted that some governors voiced “appreciation” to him during a conference call. Trump was purposefully doing nothing about the pandemic, Americans were losing their lives every day, and all he could think about was garnering adoration and political points.
Trump insisted on the re-opening of the economy, although our public health experts warned that it was too soon.
Trump did not care.
He knows that his re-election fate rests in the hands of a revived economy. The result is that there have been major surges of COVID-19 in multiple states around the country. Our infection and death numbers are growing. The virus is not contained. Things are as bad now as before.  Trump erroneously claimed that the economy is much better, saying, “Biggest stock market increase since 1974.” Then he lied and told us that the virus had been reduced to “ashes,” and that it will magically “just disappear” very soon. His latest lie is that the virus will simply “fade away.” And he has repeatedly asserted that the infection numbers would dwindle if we would just stop doing mass testing for it.
Now Trump is clamoring for all schools to open because this would be another reflection that normalcy has been established. But public health experts are arguing against opening schools too soon. The virus is still raging in many communities. If children get infected at school, they will take the virus home with them endangering their parents and their grandparents. More and more infections in children will make matters even worse.
Trump revived his pandemic press briefings last week, signaling at least a recognition that COVID-19 is not being contained throughout the country.
Did he announce a new national strategy for beating the pandemic? No. Is he relying on his public health experts for their recommendations? No. In other words, nothing has changed.
Trump’s lack of a national plan for this pandemic represents an unforgivable sin in leadership. He continues to blame anyone and everyone for his abysmal failure, ranging from China to Barack Obama to Anthony Fauci. When blaming others does not work, Trump resorts to his old friend: gaslighting.
Donald Trump is an accessory to mass murder. This is his pandemic and these are his American deaths. The virus is the killer, but Trump could have stopped it largely in its tracks had he attended to it in January and February.  He chose not to. He made a deliberate and calculated decision to allow the coronavirus to flourish.  All because he was focused on his re-election path and his self-preservation.
Keep this in mind: if we had started social distancing on March 1, we could have saved at least 56,000 lives. How many could we have saved if we had started in January or February? And if nothing changes going forward, we will have at least 200,000 American deaths by Election Day.
Trump is unfit to be president. He is a clear and present danger to all Americans. His botchery of this pandemic shows him to be inept, self-absorbed, and dishonest.
It must be his undoing on November 3.

In northern California, evacuation orders took effect on Monday in northeastern Siskiyou County as the Caldwell Fire spread. On Tuesday, winds pushed smoke from a massive structure fire in San Francisco to the East Bay. These are but two of many fires burning across the state — the presence of which has heightened fears that the intersection of two crises, wildfire season and COVID-19, will worsen both. Indeed, as the Golden State experiences record increases in coronavirus cases, pulmonologists are concerned about how the next few months will play out.
“The pandemic is new for all of us,” Panagis Galiatsatos, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who is a pulmonary physician and media spokesperson for the American Lung Association, told Salon. “No one’s written ‘how to handle a pandemic,’ and no one’s written ‘how to handle a pandemic and a wildfire.'”
Galiatsatos said he is concerned that wildfires might increase the likelihood of the coronavirus spreading, partly as a result of Californians being displaced. California is already experiencing a spread of coronavirus at very high rates, despite its early success with a statewide lockdown. According to the California Department of Public Health, California has a total of 466,550 positive cases as of July 28 — the highest number of a U.S. state, according to the CDC, although California is also the nation’s most populous. In total, 8,518 have died from COVID-19 in California.
“Wildfires are requesting people to relocate given their homes are in danger, and suddenly you’re taking people who have been quarantined and asking them to find a new place to live,” Dr. Galiatsatos told Salon. “Now they’re expanding their social bubble out of necessity without the appropriateness of really thorough contact tracing to understand where these family members have been, and so forth.”
Another concern, Galiatsatos said, is how exposure to wildfire smoke might lead to an increase in severity of symptoms. In non-coronavirus times, vulnerable populations are warned to stay inside when there’s wildfire smoke. Now, such directives become even more important.
“Wildfires will put out a lot of just natural pollutants, but these can really impact people’s breathing conditions,” Galiatsatos said. “Your underlying breathing status may be impacted by the consequences of the wildfire, and add a viral infection to this and your symptoms might be worse than expected.”
“You’re asking the immune system to do two things at once and it may not be able to do that,” Galiatsatos added.
John Balmes, MD a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco, told Salon in an email he agrees that exposure to wildfire smoke is likely a risk factor for a COVID-19 infection, “based on multiple studies in humans and animals on the effect of non-wildfire [2.5 micron particular matter] on risk of viral respiratory tract infections.” Balmes added that emerging research from China, Europe and the U.S. indicate that non-wildfire air pollution could increase the COVID-19 death rate. Specifically, a study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that people with COVID-19 who live in U.S. regions with higher levels of air pollution are more likely to die from the disease.
As Californians have surely noticed, wildfires and the haze they generate have become more common in recent years. According to a paper by researchers at Harvard and Yale universities, smoke waves “are likely to be longer, more intense, and more frequent under climate change, which raises health, ecological, and economic concerns.” As Salon has previously reported, the long-term effects of exposure to this kind of smoke is still unknown.
Galiatsatos said the good news is that there are ways for people to protect themselves from wildfire smoke with cloth masks. While previous smoke waves in California have led people to buy N95 masks, Galiatsatos said he doesn’t encourage the general public to go out and buy N95s because of the shortage, but also because they need to be fitted properly to work.
“Your simple cloth mask, that will work,” Galiatsatos said.

0,2020-07-29T20:25:38+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/governor-announces-withdrawal-of-federal-forces-from-portland-but-theres-a-catch/,Governor announces withdrawal of federal forces from Portland — but there’s a catch,"An immediate withdrawal of federal forces in Portland, Oregon appeared unlikely Wednesday even after Gov. Kate Brown, who called the officers “an occupying force,” said they would leave the city on Thursday.
In a statement, Brown said that federal agents will begin leaving the city if certain conditions are met and that local and state police would take over protection of the outside of federal buildings in downtown Portland. Federal agents will mostly remain inside, she said, though there will be some forces remaining outside.
“The local Oregon officers of the Oregon State Police will provide protection for free speech and the security of the exterior of the courthouse with the Federal Protective Service,” said Brown. “A limited contingent of federal officials, who act as building security year-round, will remain and will stay focused on the interior of the U.S. Courthouse.”
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, in contrast to Brown’s comments, said in a statement that his agents would remain on the streets in Portland until he deemed it necessary to withdraw—not on the governor’s timeline.
“The Department will continue to maintain our current, augmented federal law enforcement personnel in Portland until we are assured that the Hatfield Federal Courthouse and other federal properties will no longer be attacked,” said Wolf.
In an appearance on Fox News Wednesday afternoon, Wolf doubled down, telling anchor Bill Hemmer that agents would not be leaving the city on Thursday despite Brown’s claims that they would.
“We are not leaving Portland until we are assured that that courthouse is safe and secure,” said Wolf. “We will continue to keep law enforcement officers in the area.”
The White House confirmed that position to the Washington Examiner Wednesday.
“As the president and Secretary Wolf have both made clear, federal law enforcement officers will not leave until the seat of justice in Portland is secure,” White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews said in a statement.
The Washington Post shed some light on the details of the plan:
The Federal Protective Service—the DHS agency responsible for protecting federal properties around the country—will remain at the courthouse with assistance from U.S. Marshals, Wolf said. Some state police will join them inside the perimeter fence, but DHS wants the state troopers and local police to keep the angry crowds and rioters away from the building, according to DHS officials who provided details on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss it publicly.
Federal agents descended on Portland earlier in the month in response to ongoing protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd by four Minneapolis police officers in May.
Brown and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler were both highly critical of the federal presence in the city, with Brown tweeting that the agents “have acted as an occupying force and brought violence.”
“The federal occupation of our community has brought a new kind of fear to our streets,” said Wheeler.
According to the New York Times:
Portland has seen more than 60 days of consecutive protests since Mr. Floyd’s death. Much of the strife in the city had been between Portland police officers and the protesters.
But after President Trump issued an executive order to protect statues and federal property, federal officials sent militarized tactical teams to Portland. They employed aggressive tactics to keep demonstrators away from federal property. One protester was shot in the head with a crowd-control munition, and a Navy veteran was hit repeatedly with a baton as he stood still. In a tactic that was challenged in court by the Oregon attorney general, the federal officers used unmarked vans to target protesters for arrest.
Due to the conflicting statements on the timing and scope of the withdrawal, journalist Joshua Potash cautioned against reading too deeply into Brown’s statement and urged demonstrators to remain vigilant.
“The withdraw is conditional, like the courthouse being secure,” said Potash. “So feds can stay as long as they want.”

0,2020-07-29T20:15:45+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-pentagon-is-now-training-the-military-to-view-protestors-and-journalists-as-a-threat-report/,‘Appalling and dangerous’: Trump’s Pentagon chief under fire after leaked military docs refer to journalists as ‘adversaries’,"Secretary of Defense Mark Esper is requiring all all DoD personnel, including military, civilian and on-site contractors, to complete a course that refers to protestors and even journalists as “adversaries,” Politico reports. In defending the term, a Pentagon spokesperson went on to refer to protestors and journalists as a “threat.”
The “mandatory Pentagon training course” is “designed to teach Defense Department personnel how to better protect sensitive information,” namely leaks, Politico adds. The training must be completed in the next 60 days.
“The Department of Defense (DoD) remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust. [However] unauthorized disclosures jeopardize our DoD personnel, operations, strategies and policies to the benefit of our adversaries,” Secretary Esper writes in a memo.
Experts are expressing concern.
“‘Adversary’ is a loaded term, we use it to define Russia, for example,” says ABC News analyst Mick Mulroy, who served as the Pentagon’s Middle East policy official in the Trump administration.
In case there’s any question as to how dangerous this is, former Pentagon press secretary and CIA spokesperson George Little calls it “appalling and dangerous.”
“It brings to mind the same tin ear Secretary Esper recently demonstrated when he used the military term battlespace to describe America’s city streets,” Little told Politico. “The Pentagon and the press have a long history over working alongside each other in service of the American people. Even when they don’t see eye to eye on the issues, there’s been a long history of respect for their common mission, and it’s unfortunate that the current Pentagon leadership has largely abandoned it.”

0,2020-07-29T19:59:30+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/how-the-media-helped-trump-push-his-big-lie-about-covid-19/,How the media helped Trump push his big lie about COVID-19,"After snookering the endlessly gullible mainstream media last week with another of his endless “pivots,” Donald Trump was back to his normal self — spreading conspiracy theories, making up ridiculous lies, not caring one single bit about the well-being of the people he was elected to serve — at Tuesday’s so-called coronavirus briefing. His campaign is now heralding Trump’s supposedly new understanding that the pandemic is a very serious thing, but Trump didn’t act that way. He spent the entire event minimizing the dangers of the virus, pushing a hoax theory that there’s a “cure” and insisting that states end lockdown restrictions that Trump believes are hobbling the economy and damaging his chances for re-election.
Since the very beginning of this pandemic, Trump has attached himself to the notion that it’s the lockdowns, rather than the virus itself, that are causing the country’s economic pain. As early as March, Trump was pronouncing on Twitter: “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.” Here we are in July, and he seems committed to the idea that simply “reopening” the country will bring the economy roaring back and create a rationale for his re-election, an outcome he would clearly sacrifice millions of lives to secure.
The problem is that Trump’s core assumption — one shared by most of the Republican Party, which has embraced the “reopening” strategy nearly across the board — is wrong. What’s destroying the economy is and always has been the virus. There will be no economic recovery unless the virus is contained, no matter how many bars are open for business.
Unfortunately, the mainstream media spread and reinforced this false narrative for months, making it impossible to have a meaningful public discussion about what it would it actually take both to protect public health and save the economy.
As economist Paul Krugman explained in his New York Times column on Monday, “the ‘rocket ship‘ recovery Donald Trump promised has crashed and burned” and job growth “appears to have stalled or reversed, especially in states that were most aggressive about lifting social distancing mandates.”
The reason is simple enough: You can reopen restaurants and bars all you want, but that won’t restart the economy when most Americans are unwilling to go out and spend money, since doing so puts them and their families at obvious risk of severe lingering illness or death.
This dichotomy between saving the economy and slowing the viral spread was always false, as I argued early on in the pandemic. Far from destroying the economy, in fact, aggressive lockdowns coupled with extensive government aid — as well as other measures Trump rejected, like widespread testing and mask mandates — offered the only real hope of containing the virus quickly enough to get back to normal. Now it’s much too late for that, and the economic pain is going to be dragged out far longer than it had to be.
As soon as Trump started pushing this false choice between the economy and public health, the mainstream media accepted and promoted that framework, turning a phony binary — that was never a choice at all — into common wisdom. Here are some of the most damning examples.
March 25, Bloomberg News: “The Coronavirus Trade-Off That Won’t Go Away: Whether we like it or not, the choice between lives and the economy is already dictating events.”
March 27, CNN: “Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s coronavirus podcast for March 26: Saving lives or saving the economy.”
March 30, Reuters: “The U.S. weighs the grim math of death vs. the economy.”
April 1, WBUR: “‘Saving The Economy Versus Saving Lives?’: An Ethicist and Economist Consider a Coronavirus Question.”
April 10, New York Times: “Restarting America Means People Will Die. So When Do We Do It? Five thinkers weigh moral choices in a crisis.”
April 15, NPR: “Lives vs. the Economy.”
May 1, San Francisco Chronicle: “Save the economy or save lives: Bay Area residents debate morality of shelter in place”
To be certain, from the beginning some journalists tried to fight back against this dangerous false dichotomy, pointing out that many economists believed the only way to save the economy was to stop the pandemic, and that widespread lockdowns, far from hurting the economy, were the only way to save it in the long run.
These efforts were largely in vain, however. Trump’s phony choice got stuck in the public imagination, and Americans picked their sides without really stopping to ask if there was even a real conflict here.
Now, two full months into the “reopening” experiment, we have our answer: There was no way to bring the economy back to full strength without stopping the virus. We get to live in the worst of both worlds, with a cratering economy and a rapidly spreading pandemic that sets new records nearly every day.
Indeed, this false notion the media propped up for months, that there’s some legitimate choice between the economy and public health, is still being invoked not just by Trump, but by the entire Republican Party. It’s a useful myth for defending a coronavirus bill that falls far short of offering the financial aid needed to keep the economy on life support until the virus is defeated. (Which will have to happen by way of a vaccine created at record speed, since Trump failed so badly at containing it any other way.)
For instance, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, appeared on CBS on Sunday, denouncing an extension of unemployment benefits by arguing that “we have an absolute economic catastrophe” and “we have got to get America back to work.” He went on to insinuate that restaurant employees who are on unemployment due to the pandemic are simply too lazy to return to work.
This is, of course, complete honking nonsense. It’s not just that these folks have a legitimate fear of getting the coronavirus, although that’s true. But there’s also no good reason to go back to work, when most potential customers are extremely unlikely to risk their lives by going out to eat.
Cruz and his fellow Republicans don’t actually care about an economic recovery, of course. If they did, as Krugman points out, they would have “wanted to sustain consumer purchasing power until wages recovered.” There is literally only one way to do that: Robust unemployment benefits and other financial assistance. Reopening won’t recover wages — businesses won’t be able to pay their employees if they don’t have customers.
Republicans clearly don’t care if the economy craters, likely because they learned from the 2008 crash that wealthy Americans and corporations will be just fine, shielded by the government bailouts they won’t extend to ordinary working people. This entire song-and-dance about “getting America back to work” is about kicking people off unemployment, even if returning to work means making significantly lower wages than they did before the pandemic — if they get wages at all. It’s class war, full stop.
But this reality is still being obscured because too many gullible reporters and editors spent months propping up the narrative that there was some kind of ethical or philosophical choice between saving the economy and stopping the virus.
It was a seductive lie, no doubt. Debating an intriguing ethical dilemma is fun! Plus, that false dichotomy created a conflict between Team Economy and Team Human Life, and everyone knows that ratings and clicks are driven by conflict.
It felt like being a spoilsport to be the person who pointed out that there was no conflict at all, and that the only way to save the economy was to contain the virus. As things turned out, by spending months “debating” this alluring but imaginary ethical dilemma, the media missed the real story, which was that Trump and Republicans did everything they could to both tank the economy and spread the disease.
It’s probably too late for this, but there’s a lesson in this for journalists: View all frameworks offered up by politicians with intense skepticism, especially coming from those who are known to be pathological liars. The task here was clear enough: Expose Trump’s bogus narrative, rather swallowing and regurgitating it. By uncritically embracing Trump’s false choice, the media gave cover to Republican politicians who made the entire situation worse, driving the pandemic to every corner of the nation and driving the economy deep into the ditch. Now the whole country is in a tailspin, and there’s no obvious way to pull out of it.

David Perdue had to pull an ad for anti-Semitism after The Forward showed that it included a picture of Perdue’s Democratic—and Jewish—opponent, Jon Ossoff, altered to make his nose appear larger. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, though, isn’t taking down an ad that darkens the skin of his opponent, Jaime Harrison, who is Black.
“It’s sad that detractors are making up fake accusations about this graphic,” according to a Graham campaign spokesman, who admitted that the ad used an “artistic effect.” You know, the artistic effect of making a Black man look darker and therefore ostensibly scarier.
Graham’s campaign also insisted the “artistic effect” was innocent because the same effect was, they said, used on Graham recently in a video. Okay, if that happened, was that video from the Harrison campaign? One somehow feels the Graham campaign would mention it if that were the case. Additionally, there’s something different about showing someone’s face thrown into shadow as a frame or two of a video and darkening a still photo. And, oh, right, racism exists and it’s different to darken a Black man’s skin.
“It’s the kind of dog-whistle politics that the Republican party has been practicing for a number of years now,” state Rep. JA Moore told CNN. “This is the oldest trick in the book,” Harrison’s campaign posted on Facebook. Indeed. Even if you leave out Perdue’s anti-Semitic ad, this is far from the first case of Republicans darkening the skin of a Black person for campaign purposes.
For instance, in 2019, the National Republican Congressional Committee sent out an email with an image of former NFL star and activist Colin Kaepernick with darkened skin. Sen. John McCain’s campaign did the same to then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008, and McCain was supposedly an honorable Republican—one who’d been the subject of racist attacks centering on rumors about his adopted Bangladeshi daughter in the 2000 South Carolina election. Also in 2008, the National Republican Congressional Committee darkened the skin of Democratic House candidate Ashwin Madia. Just this month, a PAC sent out a mailer darkening the skin of Democratic candidate T’wina Nobles in a Washington State Senate race.
It’s not a new tactic, but it is a racist one. Oh, and by the way:

0,2020-07-29T18:51:33+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/mitch-mcconnell-is-turning-almost-everyone-against-him-with-his-disastrous-relief-bill/,Mitch McConnell is turning almost everyone against him with his disastrous relief bill,"A CNBC/Change Research survey of voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin found overwhelming opposition to the Senate Republicans’ coronavirus stimulus approach. Sixty-nine percent want the federal government to give aid to states to help them avoid massive budget cuts. Sixty-two percent want an extension of the federal $600-a-week unemployment insurance enhancement. And 58 percent are opposed to giving legal immunity to corporations from COVID-19 related lawsuits.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell found it impossible to get any consensus within his caucus for a bill. The end product satisfied no one. For example, Senator Rick Scott served two terms as the governor of Florida, so you might expect him to be sympathetic to the concept of aiding states that are now facing huge budget shortfalls. But he’s too much of an ideologue to have any empathy for his successor: “I’m very concerned about the amount of money we’re talking about. What I don’t want to do is bail out the states. That’s wrong.”
Maybe Sen. Scott would be less perturbed if he actually read his party’s bill:
The Republican proposal would not allocate any new aid to states and municipalities, instead giving them more flexibility in how they spend relief money approved earlier this year.
Senator Rand Paul was so concerned about the cost that he stormed out of a caucus meeting, despite the fact that the bill “would slash the extra federal unemployment benefit to $200 per week, [and] then shift to a 70% replacement of an individual’s previous wages.” As to the unpopularity of his position, he was defiant: “I think they have the misguided notion that you have to spend this or you can’t get elected.” Based on the survey results, Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Martha McSally of Arizona probably think Rand Paul is out of his mind.
The liability protection provision is not only included in the GOP bill, but McConnell insists it’s the one thing that is non-negotiable.
Pelosi and Schumer questioned McConnell’s willingness to reach an agreement, saying the Kentucky Republican has indicated he wouldn’t compromise on his demands for liability protections for schools and businesses in the next bill.
“That is no way to negotiate particularly when his provision is so extreme,” Schumer told reporters Tuesday afternoon.
Drawing a “red line” on a policy that is supported by only 33 percent of voters in battleground states seems like dumb politics, but McConnell is serving his funders here — and money can shape opinion.
Sen. Lindsey Graham tried to sound optimistic, saying: “I think if Mitch can get half the conference, that’d be quite an accomplishment.” But, of course, that comment makes little sense. McConnell needs near-unanimity from his caucus to pass anything without Democratic votes. And his bill will have to be merged with Nancy Pelosi’s completely different House bill and then go through the Senate a second time. McConnell has zero leverage because his caucus is not behind him and the public hates his proposal. Pelosi is happy to walk away and blame the Senate for pursuing toxic policies.
However, the further McConnell moves in Pelosi’s direction, the fewer votes he will have from Senate Republicans, so he’s at risk of passing something that is supported by only a handful of his caucus. If nothing passes, it will badly hurt his party’s chances in the fall, and he knows this even if Rand Paul does not.

Louie Gohmert, one of the most obnoxious and ignorant members of Congress, tested positive for the coronavirus Wednesday after being repeatedly seen not wearing a mask in contact with others.
And a report from Politico’s Jake Sherman shortly after the news was revealed gave a damning glimpse into the congressman’s reckless and cruel treatment of his own staff. In the newsletter Playbook, Sherman revealed he received the following note after reporting Gohmert had the virus from a member of the lawmaker’s staff:
Jake, thank you for letting our office know Louie tested positive for the Coronavirus. When you write your story, can you include the fact that Louie requires full staff to be in the office, including three interns, so that ‘we could be an example to America on how to open up safely.’ When probing the office, you might want to ask how often were people berated for wearing masks.
It’s a searing indictment of the way the lax Republican attitude toward the virus has endangered their own people.
But it gets worse. Katherine Faulders of ABC News reported:
Just want to emphasize — Rep. Gohmert returned to his Capitol Hill office & told staff he wanted to inform them *in person* instead of finding out from news reports. Some staffers were already in the process of leaving as Gohmert came back, I’m told. https://t.co/Aie1K2jPAc
— Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) July 29, 2020
It shouldn’t need to be said, but it is not necessary — and indeed should be avoided — to inform people in person that you have contracted an airborne virus.
It gets worse still.
Attorney General Bill Barr and Gohmert were seen walking in close proximity just yesterday without masks:
Congressman Gohmert who hates wearing masks just tested positive for #COVID19 — he’s seen here walking behind AG Bill Barr yesterday…. without a mask naturally. Public endangerment is the name of the game for GOP MOCs. pic.twitter.com/YEx46ptp4v
— Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) July 29, 2020
And now, it seems, Gohmert is trying to blame masks for the fact that he contracted the virus. To be clear, health experts do not believe that face coverings make it more likely for the wearer to contract the virus, and the evidence indicates it reduces the wearer’s chance of spreading or contracting it. Medical doctors, of course, know this, which is why they frequently wear masks, especially when dealing with COVID-19 patients. But Gohmert spread this dangerous misinformation anyway:
Rep. Louie Gohmert thinks that it’s possible that wearing a mask gave him COVID. pic.twitter.com/kucy119Pcv
— Charlie Gile (@CharlieGileNBC) July 29, 2020
And unfortunately, after Sherman sent out the Playbook newsletter, he revealed that the problem fo reckless behavior may extend well beyond Gohmert’s office:
Ever since PM came out, Ive gotten a flood of emails from republican staffers who say they too are being forced to come to the hill without a mask now.
If you’re one of those people, email me or dm me.

Contrary to numerous studies, including those from the Dept. of Health and Human Services, Trump is falsely claiming “low income” housing causes housing prices to drop and crime to increase.
“I am happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood,” Trump tweeted.
“Your housing prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!” he added.
The nation is in great need of much more affordable housing, especially as Americans are being evicted at increasing rates during the coronavirus pandemic.
On Tuesday night Trump held a “tele-rally” with Iowa voters, during which he shared a similar message, although even more racist than the one he just tweeted.
Trump declared Democrats “don’t mind if low-income housing is built in a neighborhood, in a beautiful suburb of Iowa, but a beautiful suburb anywhere in the country. They want low – and this has been going on for years, Obama made it much worse, and now they want Cory Booker to run that program, Cory Booker of New Jersey, to run that program and make it many times worse than it is right now.”
Senator Booker has nothing to do with affordable housing.
Trump had been trying to court Black voters but after he fired Brad Parscale and installed Bill Stepien as his new campaign manager the plan now appears to try to appeal to white suburban women, who has left him in droves.
Trump in fact did roll back an Obama-era fair housing rule last week – a rule he’s never enforced.
“In a move squarely aimed at courting white conservative suburban voters,” ABC News reported, “the Trump administration on Thursday officially dismantled an Obama-era rule that sought to lessen the impact of decades of racial segregation in America’s neighborhoods.”
As NCRM reported overnight, Vox examined a 2016 study that found “adding low-income housing to poor neighborhoods lowers crime and boosts property values.”
The Dept. of Health and Human Services found that the opening of an affordable housing development in Mount Laurel, NJ, “was not associated with trends in crime, property values, or taxes, and discuss management practices and design features that may have mitigated potential negative externalities.”

That letter, attorney Paul Rosenzweig stresses in a USA Today op-ed published on July 28, was perfectly justified — as Barr has shown a pattern of dishonesty.
Rosenzweig, who served as a senior counsel to right-wing attorney Kenneth Starr during the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, writes, “According to the complaint, Attorney General Barr has violated the Washington, D.C. rules and engaged in unethical conduct. It says he has been dishonest and deceitful, and has also interfered with the administration of justice. Barr, of course, is not just any lawyer — he is the most important public lawyer in America. If anything, ethical violations by a lawyer holding a public office should be viewed as more egregious because the violations betray the public trust attached to the office.”
Barr, Rosenzweig argues, has done many unethical things in support of Trump, including undermining former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.
“Fundamentally, Barr breached his duty to the American people by advancing the interests of the president over those of the nation,” according to Rosenzweig. “He did so by systematically engaging in deceitful and misleading dishonesty.”
Barr, Rosenzweig adds, was dishonest about the Mueller Report and the former special counsel’s conclusions.
“In multiple statements and press appearances,” Rosenzweig  explains, “Barr said the report absolved the president of criminal liability for obstructing justice. We now know, of course, that it did no such thing and that, as over 1000 prosecutors have said, the evidence of the president’s criminality was substantial. Being dishonest with the public in this way is unethical, deceitful conduct.”

0,2020-07-29T17:08:14+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/senate-gop-rejects-pandemic-food-stamp-aid-while-calling-to-double-3-martini-lunch-deduction/,Senate GOP rejects pandemic food stamp aid while calling to double ‘3-martini lunch’ deduction,"Senate Republicans rejected an extension of a program that expanded food aid to families affected by the coronavirus pandemic in their relief proposal but included a provision which would double the “three-martini lunch” deduction for business meals.
The Census Bureau reported that about 26 million adults and between 8 to 15 million children live in households that did not have enough food last month. Images around the country, from Arizona and Texas to New York and Massachusetts, show mile-long lines at food banks amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
But the Republican Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection and Schools Act (HEALS Act), which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., unveiled on Monday, did not include either an expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly referred to as food stamps, or an extension of the Pandemic EBT program, which provides aid to families with children who recently lost access to free meals at schools, The Washington Post reports. It does, however, include a tax break on business lunches.
“It is deeply disappointing that it failed to include a SNAP benefit increase or an extension to Pandemic EBT,” Lisa Davis of the food aid group Share Our Strength told the outlet. “We know that childhood food insecurity is soaring to levels we’ve never seen.”
“This bill is entirely divorced from the reality of the crisis this country is facing,” added Sarah Reinhardt of the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Food and Environmental Program.
The decision comes amid the Trump administration’s push to reopen schools despite high rates of infection in numerous states, though President Donald Trump finally acknowledged last week that schools in hot spots would have to delay reopening for several “weeks.”
Low-income families have been hit hardest by the pandemic, with nearly a third facing food insecurity in the last month, according to an analysis by the Hamilton Project. The analysis found more than five times as many children facing food insecurity in June than in all of 2018 and nearly three times as many as during the Great Recession in 2018.
People of color, who have been hit hard by the pandemic, have also disproportionately experienced the brunt of the financial shock it has caused. Nearly 40% of Black and Latinx families with children face food insecurity, according to a study by researchers at Northwestern University.
“Given the national conversation about institutional racism and inequality, the decision is baffling,” Luis Guardia, who heads the advocacy group Food Research and Action Center, told The Post. “It’s hard to think of a program that has SNAP’s virtuous cycle of feeding people. That money turns over in the local economy quickly and creates more jobs, and ultimately if people have steady jobs, they aren’t hungry.”
While the bill eschewed food aid for millions of hungry families, it would double the so-called “three-martini-lunch” deduction for business meals from 50% to 100%. The bill also includes $30 billion for military projects and nearly $2 billion for a new FBI building near Trump’s Washington hotel.
“They didn’t have money for food stamps, but they had money for an FBI building just so that they can diminish competition for the president’s hotel,” Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Monday.
Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., told HuffPost that he included the meal deduction increase in hope that it would increase business for venues with “limited indoor dining.” The idea was also repeatedly pushed by Trump himself, who claimed it would “bring restaurants and everything related back.”
“If your notion of addressing food security is a tax deduction for expensive business dinners but not making sure that no child in America goes to bed hungry, you may be a Republican,” Pelosi said on Twitter.
Senate Republicans are also pushing to slash federal unemployment benefits from $600 to $200 per week, claiming that the “generous” benefit makes it difficult for companies to bring back workers despite a lack of evidence. Numerous economists have found that the unemployment benefits have helped prop up the economy, and drastically cutting them would shrink the GDP and cost the country millions of jobs.
Republicans also rejected the Democratic proposal to provide about $1 trillion in aid to cash-strapped states and cities, offering them zero new funding. That could result in mass layoffs for government workers like nurses and hospital employees, teachers and public health and safety workers.
“McConnell’s COVID bill is a parade of horribles: Want a $400 tax subsidy for three martini lunches? You got it. Money for hungry American children? Too bad. Want to cut support for workers who’ve lost their jobs? Sure. A moratorium on utility cutoffs and evictions? No dice,” Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who sits on the Senate Appropriations and Budget committees, wrote on Twitter. ” Can you believe we had to wait more than two months for this ludicrous proposal?? They’re wasting time and endangering lives & livelihoods.”

“Even though a majority of voters have disapproved of his job performance overall during most of his presidency, more voters than not have given him a thumbs-up on the economy,” wrote Enten. “But Trump now may be seeing this advantage dissipate. His approval on the economy has seen a dramatic decline since the beginning of the year, and he’s lost his edge on the economy over former Vice President Joe Biden.”
“Trump’s economic approval was at one of the strongest levels of his presidency at the beginning of the year,” wrote Enten. “He averaged a 56% approval rating on the economy in a January and February average of polls from ABC News/Washington Post, Fox News, NBC News/Wall Street Journal and Quinnipiac University. His disapproval rating on the economy in these same polls was just 38%. In July, these same polls give him a 49% approval rating to a 47% disapproval rating. When you look at all the polls, you come to a very similar finding. Trump’s net approval rating on the economy (approval minus disapproval) has dropped from +16 points in January to just +1 point in July.”
Enten noted that some of the drop may be due to voters losing confidence in Trump in general — but added that the severe economic downturn is likely responsible for much of this decline.
Trump had previously planned to use economic growth as the basis for his re-election campaign. But with the coronavirus pandemic triggering shutdowns and mass unemployment, that is no longer possible.
“Trump’s goals in the final three months of this campaign are clear: If he can’t cut his deficit on the coronavirus, he must at a minimum get voters to think he is the better steward of the economy,” concluded Enten. “If the President doesn’t turn things around, the lack of an advantage on any of the major issues will almost certainly prove fatal for his campaign.”

And McClatchy’s David Catanese is reporting that Trump’s reelection campaign has suspended its Michigan advertising.
Catanese reports that according to the ad tracking firm Medium Buying, Trump’s campaign “continues to advertise in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin” —two other Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016 — even though its ads in Michigan have ceased. And America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, has not had any ads in Michigan since July 2.
The journalist also notes that according to data provided by Advertising Analytics, Trump’s reelection campaign “devoted significantly fewer resources to Michigan in July than in either Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.” Trump’s campaign, Catanese reports, went from spending $2.5 million in Michigan in June to spending less than $1 million in Michigan in July.
A Trump campaign official, quoted anonymously, told McClatchy, “The numbers speak for themselves, and the advertising dollars speak for themselves. The campaign thinks they have a better shot in Pennsylvania, and that’s why they are matching Biden on advertising there.”
No credible polls, Catanese observes, have found Trump ahead in Michigan. A Morning Consult poll released on July 28 found Trump trailing Biden by 10% in that Rust Belt state. And other recent polls found the former vice president leading in Michigan by 12% (CNBC/Change Research), 10% (YouGov/CBS News) or 11% (Fox News).
A GOP pollster, interviewed by McClatchy, said of Trump’s performance in polls on Michigan, “The numbers are dismal. Hard to see how it remains competitive.”

Louie Gohmert (R-TX) tested positive for the coronavirus, and his past statements and actions came back to haunt him.
The Texas Republican took part in a Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, and was spotted greeting Attorney General Bill Barr without a mask. He has previously stated his opposition to safety measures to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.
Gohmert: And I do want to advise our media friends before they wrote stories about how we didn’t wear masks and we possibly didn’t socially distance adequately, that you saw to it that we had tests and nobody in here has the Coronavirus unless it’s somebody in the media. pic.twitter.com/SbnjtGboSi

It’s too early to predict and obviously there are just so many variables and moving parts, but just projecting from his raw tools I’d say that Louie Gohmert has what it takes to contract Covid four or even five times. The scouting comp here is Jair Bolsonaro. He’s just that good.

And in a biting July 29 article for The Bulwark, the 63-year-old opinion columnist/author and former Nancy Reagan speechwriter argues that the more victories Democrats enjoy in November, the better off conservatism will be in the long run.
Charen is not only hoping that former Vice President Joe Biden will defeat Trump by a “landslide” in November — she is also hoping to see Democrats retake the U.S. Senate and increase their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. That doesn’t mean that Charen is turning liberal or progressive or even centrist, contrary to what Trumpistas claim; rather, Charen shares The Lincoln Project’s view that Trumpism has been so toxic for conservatism that a massive blue wave is needed to repudiate it.
Republicans in the Senate and House who refused to stand up to Trump, Charen stresses, were “enablers” — and they need to pay a price for it politically in November.
“Donald Trump undermined the institution of the free press, urging his followers to disbelieve everything except what came from the leader,” Charen writes. “And Republicans were silent. He weakened respect for law enforcement and the courts…. And Republicans were silent. He enriched himself and his family, and Republicans were silent. He introduced doubt about accepting the results of elections. He scorned allies and toadied to dictators. And Republicans were silent.”
Charen, in her article, takes issue with fellow Never Trump conservative David French — who is vehemently anti-Trump but disagrees with The Lincoln Project’s “burn it all down” approach and believes that getting rid of as many GOP senators as possible is akin to shooting the hostages. GOP senators who are afraid to stand up to Trump, as French sees it, are his hostages. But Charen sees them as complicit in Trump’s abuses.
“Voting against a candidate or even a whole party is not nihilism,” Charen emphasizes. “It’s not ‘burning it all down.’ It’s the legal, constitutional way to express approval or disapproval. The current Republican Party has itself chosen to become the arsonist party. It has decided to go along with undermining faith in institutions, shredding norms, elevating conspiracy theories, disregarding laws and tossing aside truth whenever the leader dictates. The most demoralizing aspect of the past four years has not been that a boob conman was elected president, but that one of the two great political parties surrendered to him utterly.”
Charen expresses no sympathy for Republicans who are only willing to criticize Trump behind closed doors, stressing that a Democratic landslide is the fate they deserve.
“If more Republicans had shown a willingness to stand for basic political hygiene, for elemental human decency earlier in this awful era, it might have become contagious,” Charen argues. “But since that did not happen, the only thing that will send a message to the Republican Party commensurate with its moral abdication over the past four years is to lose in a landslide — not just Trump, but his silent enablers too.”

But Joan Biskupic, a CNN legal analyst, is reporting that according to “multiple sources,” Kavanaugh “urged his colleagues in a series of private memos this spring to consider avoiding decisions in major disputes over abortion and Democratic subpoenas for President Donald Trump’s financial records.”
In June Medical Services v. Russo, the Supreme Court recently struck down an anti-abortion law in Louisiana. Biskupic reports that Kavanaugh wanted the Court to “sidestep” the June Medical case — and his “plan would have ensured the law — a credentialing mandate for doctors who perform abortions — would not go into immediate effect, but also ensured that the justices would not have to put their own views on the line.”
Similarly, Biskupic notes, the 55-year-old Kavanaugh wanted the High Court to “avoid the subpoena fight over Trump financial documents, based on the judicial principle that courts should stay out of cases involving fundamentally political questions.”
“Throughout the recent Court session, as Kavanaugh revealed a desire to avoid certain thorny dilemmas, the newest justice also demonstrated a pattern of trying to publicly appeal to both sides,” Biskupic notes. “His style of accommodation was on display in recent disputes over gay and transgender workers and, separately, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.”
According to Biskupic, the memos indicate that Kavanaugh was worried about being perceived as a pro-Trump ideologue.
“In 2018, Trump chose Kavanaugh to succeed Kennedy, convinced by advisers that the (George W.) Bush loyalist would be true to Trump and his brand of conservatism,” Biskupic explains. “Kavanaugh has not turned his back on the politicians who guaranteed his High Court ascension, but his writing has suggested he does not want to appear to be a reflexive conservative vote — particularly against women.”
Regardless, Kavanaugh was among the four dissenters in June Medical and did not find Louisiana’s anti-abortion law to be unconstitutional; the other dissenters were Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Neil Gorsuch.

0,2020-07-29T13:30:49+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/devastating-to-republicans-across-the-map-gop-operatives-are-worried-democrats-will-increase-their-house-majority-in-november/,‘Devastating to Republicans across the map’: GOP operatives are worried Democrats will increase their House majority in November,"If November brings as much of a blue wave as Democratic strategists are hoping for, Democrats will not only recapture the White House and the U.S. Senate, but will also increase their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Reporter Ally Mutnick discusses that possibility in a July 29 article for Politico, addressing GOP fears that even more Democrats might be in the House in 2021.
“A slew of dismal summer polls and a persistent fundraising gap have left some Republicans fretting about a nightmare scenario in November: that they will fall further into the House minority,” Mutnick explains. “Publicly, House GOP leaders are declaring they can still net the 17 seats needed to flip the chamber. But privately, some party strategists concede it’s a much grimmer picture, with as many as 20 Republican seats at risk of falling into Democratic hands.”
Although Republicans slightly increased their Senate majority in the 2018 midterms, Democrats enjoyed a major blue wave in the House — where they enjoyed a net gain of 40 seats. When Rep. Nancy Pelosi was sworn in as House speaker in January 2019, it was obvious that the days of the House rubber stamping President Donald Trump’s agenda were over.
Former Rep. Carlos Carbelo of Florida was among the GOP congressmen who was voted out of office in 2018, and he fears that more House Republicans could suffer that same fate this year.
Carbelo told Politico, “Republicans were jolted by the fact that a lot of white suburban voters abandoned them. The question now is whether that trend will continue. If it does, it could endanger some of those districts, particularly in the Midwest.”
California’s Mike Garcia, New York’s John Katko, Pennsylvania’s Brian Fitzpatrick, Illinois’ Rodney Davis and Nebraska’s Don Bacon are some of the incumbent House Republicans Mutnick described as “vulnerable,” and others who are possibly “becoming vulnerable” — according to the Politico reporter — include Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, Rep. David Schweikert of Arizona and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas. Although Texas is a light red state at this point, it can be quite Democratic at the local level: Democrats were disappointed when Beto O’Rourke narrowly lost to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, but they were delighted over their ability to flip some GOP-held seats in some House districts in the Lone Star State.
Interviewed on condition of anonymity, a member of the National Republican Congressional Committee noted how aggressively the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been fundraising and told Politico, “The DCCC’s candidates are printing money, and the president’s falling poll numbers are devastating to Republicans across the map. That’s why (House Minority Leader Kevin) McCarthy and the NRCC need to hold the line and focus on saving incumbents first.”
Similary, long-time GOP operative Mike DuHaime told Politico, “The fact that the polling is close has got to be troubling in a lot of those districts, and the incumbents in those districts can’t view themselves as too safe. They must take it seriously.”
DCCC Executive Director Lucinda Guinn noted that a key part of Democratic strategy with the House is attacking incumbent Republicans in suburban districts.
Guinn told Politico, “Republicans have been banking on 2018 being their rock bottom, particularly in the suburbs. But we’ve built a battlefield that is big. We took back the House by going on offense in the suburbs, and we are going to continue pushing the boundaries.”

Susan Collins (R-ME) with a new ad that accuses her of failing in her duty to hold President Donald Trump accountable.
The ad begins by listing off prominent past Maine politicians, including former Republican Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, who famously stood up to Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-WI) in her famous “Declaration of Conscience” speech.
The ad then shows how Collins has failed to act as strongly as her predecessor by noting how she failed to vote to convict the president during his Senate impeachment trial.
“Susan Collins never stands up to Donald Trump,” the ad says. “That’s why Maine is done with her weakness and excuses.”
The ad then claims Collins’s reputation as an independent-minded Republican is a “fraud,” while also claiming that Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) are the ones really pulling her strings.
“Maine deserves a leader,” the ad concludes. “Not a Trump stooge.”

“Incredibly disturbing. We need answers,” New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson tweeted late Tuesday as videos of what witnesses described as a kidnapping went viral on social media.
One video shows several officers dressed in shorts and T-shirts rushing out of an unmarked Kia minivan, grabbing a demonstrator from the middle of the street, and forcing her into the van as NYPD officers with bikes formed a barrier around the vehicle. The protester was later identified by friends as an 18-year-old trans woman named Nicki.
“Suddenly there was an unmarked grey van that moved out in front of us that had been waiting for us,” one witness told Gothamist. “Four guys jumped out and a line of police bicycles came out from down the block—we hadn’t seen them. They pushed us back. They grabbed Nicki like she was a rag doll.”

“Our civil liberties are on the brink,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted in response to the incident. “This is not a drill. There is no excuse for snatching women off the street and throwing them into unmarked vans. To not protect our rights is to give them away. It is our responsibility to resist authoritarianism.”
In a statement posted to Twitter late Tuesday after the officers’ actions sparked widespread condemnation, the NYPD claimed the “woman taken into custody in an unmarked van was wanted for damaging police cameras during five separate criminal incidents in and around City Hall Park.”
“When officers from the Warrant Squad took the woman into custody in a gray NYPD minivan this evening, they were assaulted with rocks and bottles,” the NYPD said, an account witnesses dismissed as completely false. “The Warrant Squad uses unmarked vehicles to effectively locate wanted suspects.”
Clara Kraebber, a 20-year-old Oxford student who witnessed the incident, told Gothamist that “none of that happened whatsoever,” referring to the NYPD’s claim that demonstrators threw rocks and bottles at the officers. Kraebber said officers indiscriminately pepper sprayed demonstrators as the cops shoved Nicki into the  unmarked van.
“We literally turned the corner and were met with a line of police who attacked us without warning,” said Kraebber.
this is…kidnapping https://t.co/iT7SDb5RWx

The New York Civil Liberties Union, the New York state affiliate of the ACLU, called the NYPD’s behavior “horrifying and indefensible” and said it is investigating.
“We’re looking into the incident that happened tonight, but one thing is for certain: violently forcing protesters into an unmarked van are the actions of a police force that think they can act with impunity,” the group said. “We won’t allow this in our city.”

0,2020-07-29T12:34:29+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-last-ditch-display-of-fascist-theatrics-is-straight-out-of-orwell/,Trump’s last-ditch display of fascist theatrics is straight out of Orwell,"Donald Trump is a political arsonist. He has unleashed a firestorm across America. The kindling was always there. Trump chose to throw gasoline on it and set it afire.
Trump’s political cult members and other followers are dancing in a circle around the flames. In the light and noise, they see and hear things which are not there. Like the troglodytes in Plato’s allegory of the cave, they have lost the ability to discern truth from lies. All that matters is their proximity to Trump’s fire.
Good Americans have encircled Trump’s conflagration. They know the danger and power it possesses. They are also willing to be burned and suffer other injuries to save the country from its worst inclinations in the form of the fire devils that Trump commands.
Good Americans also know that fire can be used for both creation and destruction. As such, they are waiting for the right moment to seize the fire for their own purposes.
There are observers as well. Many are in the shadows cowed and afraid. Other watchers are sad and depressed and more than a little confused by what America in the Age of Trump has become.
Trump’s blazing fire is the main attraction in the American terrordome, where the spectacle of Trump’s threats, violence, lies, fear, intimidation, corruption, racism and cruelty unfold. This is the logic of reality TV made into a presidency and the resulting surreal nightmare that has entrapped the American people in the Age of Trump.
The protagonists in Trump’s spectacle are the “virtuous,” “strong” and “heroic” Donald Trump and his “patriotic” and “law-abiding” (white) followers — and of course the police and other enforcers of “law and order.”
The villains are the various recurring bogeymen of the right-wing imagination, such as Latino “rapists” and “murderers,” “invasions” and “caravans” of nonwhite people, Muslims and any other group deemed to be despised. “Anti-fascists” and “Black Lives Matter” activists, who supposedly hate America. Black athletes who kneel in protest against police thuggery and other social injustices are “thugs” who should be kicked out of the country. The George Floyd protesters and anyone else who dares to disagree with the Trump regime are enemies of the state to be purged. “Anarchists,” leftists, liberals and intellectuals with their “political correctness” are also to be disposed of.
This spectacle circulates across American society via Fox News and the larger right-wing propaganda disinformation machine. Unwittingly, those Americans with their “doomscrolling” — a phrase that sounds like something from the H.P. Lovecraft mythos or the “Hellraiser” movies — and other Trump fixations are all part of the spectacle as well.
In total, Trump’s terrordome is the theater of political terror and the “American carnage” he first promised in his 2016 inauguration speech. Trump hopes to use the same themes to win the 2020 election — and then to stay in office for as long as he wants.
Trump’s terrordome has a new attraction: his personal stormtroopers, a de facto Gestapo.
In a massive violation of the civil and human rights of the American people, Trump’s secret police are operating in Portland, Oregon, grabbing protesters off the streets and disappearing them for interrogated. Trump’s Gestapo is beating, gassing and shooting protesters with so-called non-lethal weapons, which in reality can cause grievous physical harm.
Trump has promised to unleash more than 50,000 of his personal enforcers in Democratic-led cities across the country. He will likely use these same enforcers to try to steal the 2020 election.
Trump’s theater of terror in Portland (and soon elsewhere, perhaps) is following a script common to the authoritarian playbook where the leader creates a crisis, the people resist and then the threats and violence are amplified — with the end goal being a “state of emergency” that “justifies” the authoritarian seizing even more power.
At the New York Times, former FBI director James Comey accurately summarizes Trump’s Portland gambit:
What better way for Trump to demonstrate to his followers that he is “your president of law and order” than to deploy highly visible federal officers, and in a way that is sure to invite violent conflict, which, of course, demonstrates the need for a law-and-order president? And on it goes. The only thing damaged in the process will be the United States and the federal law enforcement agencies our country needs. Yet again, the craving of our president for reelection seems to override everything.
The Trump regime is so unrestrained that it actually uses the word “theater” to describe the Portland protests and the president’s related instigations and plots to remain in power.
As reported by the Washington Post, a Trump regime official said the president had chosen Portland as “a theater for his fight,” adding that “the White House had long wanted to amplify strife in cities, encouraging DHS officials to talk about arrests of violent criminals in sanctuary cities and repeatedly urging ICE to disclose more details of raids than some in the agency were comfortable doing…. It was about getting viral online content.”
Last Friday, Trump’s White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, presented the regime’s own version of a Joseph Goebbels propaganda film in the form of a video purporting to show “riots” in Portland. This presentation was so tasteless that even Fox News cut away from the White House press briefing.
Of course, there are no “riots” except for those instigated by Trump’s enforcers and the right-wing extremists and other paramilitaries who have infiltrated what are largely peaceful gatherings.
McEnany’s propaganda film is part of a larger and obvious strategy of terrifying the American people — or at least Trump’s base of older, white Fox News watchers, who he imagines as a “silent majority” — into supporting the president’s crackdown and re-electing him.
In Trump’s terrordome these distorted images of anti-fascists, Black Lives Matter activists, mothers, veterans and other protesters are doing another type of political work as well
Violence by the Trump regime against dissenters is made legitimate. Moreover, violence by Trump’s supporters against his perceived enemies is encouraged and rendered virtuous as well
In many ways, Donald Trump’s terrordome spectacle is his version of the “Two Minutes Hate” as depicted in George Orwell’s essential book “1984”.
Writing at Bloomberg, legal scholar Cass Sunstein explains:
To see it, we have to step back a bit and consider one of George Orwell’s most powerful creations: the Two Minutes Hate, directed against Emmanuel Goldstein, “the Enemy of the People” and opponent of Big Brother.
  As Orwell depicts it in “1984,” Big Brother focuses the public on Goldstein’s misdeeds and the continuing threat he poses: “He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators.” As citizens see Goldstein’s face on a screen, they break out into “uncontrollable exclamations of rage,” followed by a “hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer.”
  Orwell’s ominous words suggest that every human heart is vulnerable to that ecstasy. “The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in.” (Think of what happens on contemporary social media.)
  For Big Brother, the Two Minutes Hate is shrewd politics. It is a diversion from issues of policy, and from problems that people face in their ordinary lives. It focuses citizens’ attention on a malevolent, even demonic force, who continues to threaten them.
Trump’s terrordome and the power he has over many tens of millions of Americans (including bystanders) also recalls the description of Nazi Germany in journalist Milton Meyer’s book “They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45”:
The world you live in — your nation, your people — is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.
Donald Trump is an authoritarian and a neo-fascist. Like others of that ilk, he is only able to destroy and not create. Nearly 150,000 Americans are dead from the coronavirus pandemic and Donald Trump’s willfully negligent response. The country is teetering on the edge of a second Great Depression. Other existential threats, such as the global climate disaster, continue their march largely unabated.
Ultimately, the Trump regime and its politics of terror and cruelty amplify the pain, suffering, fear and insecurity of the American people — and by design do nothing to soothe and heal them.
Public opinion polls and other research show that the American people are experiencing high levels of anxiety and other mental health challenges from the Age of Trump and his pandemic. Suicides have increased. The American people largely want a return to normalcy and consistency and not the chaos of the Trump regime. Life spans continue to decrease among many populations in America, include the “white working class”. The American people know that the country is going in the wrong direction and the myth of American exceptionalism is collapsing. Patriotism is at the lowest levels in several decades.
The pain, sorrow, loss, and misery are the goal: Trump and his regime are illegitimate, and hope to use his terrordome spectacle to remain in power.
Because of a deep reluctance to state those plain facts, America’s mainstream news media continues to ignore that the country is in the grip of a fascist politics and authoritarian spectacle where normal politics and the folk theory of democracy — with its “free and fair” elections, responsible political parties, politically engaged citizens, rule of law, and respect for the Constitution as well as existing political and social institutions — no longer apply.
Those people who are fortunate to live outside of Trump’s terrordome see something horrible in America. Once the leader of the world, the U.S. has lost its prestige and moral authority. Writing at the New York Times, Roger Cohen reflects on how America now looks from Germany, a country which was destroyed by fascism and then rebuilt as a leading democracy:
When paramilitary-style units have no identifying insignia, there is no transparency, no accountability — and that means impunity. Democracy dies. Think of all this as setting the scene for Trump’s own “state of emergency” if he does not like the November election result. Social media is combustible enough for a physical fire to be unnecessary.
  The president says he wants to protect law-abiding citizens. In 1933, after the Reichstag burned, Hitler issued the “Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State” as his means to seize power.
  German horror at Trump has many components. He’s the fear-mongering showman wielding nationalism, racism and violence as if the 20th century held no lessons. He’s the would-be destroyer of the multilateral institutions that brought European peace and made it possible for Germans to raise their bowed heads again. He is a fascist in the making.
At present, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in the polls. There are many ways, legitimate and otherwise, that Donald Trump could win a second term, but many observers now believe that he will be vanquished in historic fashion. Of course, that is no guarantee that Trump will peacefully leave office in January or that he may not find a way to contest the outcome.
A Biden victory would show that the American people want a return to normal. But what does “normal” really look like when the status quo did so much to vomit out Trump’s neo-fascist regime and all the destruction and human misery it created?
To light the way forward to a better America will demand much more than going back to “normal” — from Joe Biden and from all of us.

Matt Gaetz files a criminal referral against Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg with William Barr,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Monday asked Attorney General William Barr to open a criminal investigation into Mark Zuckerberg over allegations that the Facebook CEO lied to Congress.
In a letter to Barr, Gaetz accused the social media executive of making false statements to Congress on two occasions in 2018. He alleged that Zuckerberg “repeatedly and categorically denied any bias against conservative speech, persons, policies or politics” on his platform.
“On both occasions, members of Congress asked Mr. Zuckerberg about allegations that Facebook censored and suppressed content supportive of President Donald Trump and other conservatives,” Gaetz wrote.
“Mr. Zuckerberg also dismissed the suggestion that Facebook exercises any form of editorial manipulation,” he added.
Zuckerberg made the remarks in 2018 under questioning from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., who accused Facebook of “bias and censorship.” Cruz cited a 2016 Gizmodo revealing allegations that the social media platform had knowingly suppressing conservative news. Zuckerberg responded:
I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place. And this is actually a concern that I have, and that I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we don’t have any bias in the work that we do. And I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about.
As evidence to support his claims, Gaetz directed Barr to a recent sting by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization known for its efforts to take down liberal organizations, mainstream media outlets and public figures through misinformation and deceptively edited “insider” videos.
Project Veritas published hidden-camera footage of purported Facebook content moderators apparently admitting that they delete conservative posts.  Gaetz says the “whistleblowers” in the video offer “ample evidence” of the company’s “bias and manipulation.”
“According to the Veritas report and undercover footage, the adjudicators were outspoken about their political bias against Republicans and actively chose to eliminate otherwise-allowable content from the platform and from public view simply due to its political orientation,” Gaetz wrote.
“At the same time,” Gaetz added, “speech promoting violence against the president and his supporters was labeled as merely ‘political,’ and was thus allowed to stay on the platform.”
The Republican representative also claims, without citing evidence, that Facebook’s artificial intelligence content screening program is itself not politically neutral, which he alleges is a violation of the “good faith” provision of the Communications Decency Act.
Republicans — from internet trolls, up to lawmakers and President Donald Trump himself — regularly accuse Facebook and other social media platforms of anti-conservative bias.
However, Facebook launched its own project in the weeks after the 2016 election — “Project P,” for propaganda — which found dozens of pages peddling fake news ahead of Trump’s victory. Nearly all the pages were based overseas, had financial motives and “displayed a clear rightward bent,” according to the Washington Post.
Another reason why moderators may encounter a higher volume of flagged conservative content is because Facebook’s most popular content has become overwhelmingly conservative over time. “Facebook has become the home of right-wing America, while Twitter and Snap have become the home of the left,” Vanity Fair’s Nick Bilton reported earlier this year.
And while liberals have criticized Facebook for refusing to fact-check political ads — and even threatened to break up the social media platform — a number of leading conservatives have reportedly met in secret with Zuckerberg, including Tucker Carlson, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and on at least one occasion, Trump himself. Zuckerberg has not disclosed the content of those meetings.
Matt Gaetz did not respond to Salon’s request for comment. Facebook declined to comment.

Axios reporter Jonathan Swan interviewed the president about the bounties allegedly placed on U.S troops in Afghanistan and his recent call with Putin, but he told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” what shocked him the most about their conversation.
“In some ways, the most shocking part of that clip is actually not the first part where he admits for the first time on the record that he hasn’t raised the issue of the bounties with Vladimir Putin,” Swan said. “That’s the least shocking part of that call, because actually, frankly, you know, you could have a debate within policy circles about whether it’s the appropriate thing.”
“I mean, that there are dissenting opinions within the intelligence community about this intelligence,” he added. “It certainly is serious intelligence, being taken seriously by the allies, and there is a very good argument for why the president should raise it with Putin.”
But that wasn’t the most surprising revelation Trump made, Swan said.
“The second question is actually more important, which is, fine, you don’t believe this intelligence, or you’re skeptical of it,” Swan said. “Let’s try and take the most good-faith interpretation of it. But you know that Russia has been supplying weapons and money to the Taliban because the man who ran your forces in Afghanistan, John Nicholson, under your administration, said this on the record when he worked for you, and for him to say then, well, I didn’t — I don’t know if I’ve heard about this, never reached my desk, and by the way, we gave them weapons, too.”
“I mean, like in a different era,” he added. “I just — honestly, it was one of the most shocking — I’ve covered president Trump for five years. I think it’s one of the most shocking exchanges I’ve ever had with him.”

But a look at the legislative text (pdf) released by Senate Republicans shows the HEALS Act is replete with massive gifts to the Pentagon and defense contractors that would do nothing to aid the unemployed, provide nutrition assistance to hungry children, prevent an avalanche of evictions, or stop the spread of coronavirus.
“Last time I checked F-35s don’t help families pay their bills,” Rep. Chuy García (D-Ill.) tweeted in response to the GOP’s proposal of $686 million in spending on new fighter jets.
The legislation also includes hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for surveillance planes, Apache helicopters, and armored vehicles.
Just how twisted is the Senate GOP #coronavirus bill you ask?
It includes $686 million for new #F35 fighter jets. As you know, fighter jets are well known for their pandemic fighting abilities.

The HEALS Act proposes a total of $29.4 billion in new military spending just a week after the House and Senate approved a $740.5 billion Pentagon budget for fiscal year 2021.
Meanwhile, as Common Dreams reported earlier Tuesday, the Republican package includes no money for state and local governments, election assistance, or the U.S. Postal Service. The legislation would also slash the weekly federal unemployment insurance boost from $600 to $200.
The Senate Republican plan:
– $29,400,000,000 for the Pentagon
– $0 for hazard pay
– $0 for nutrition assistance
– $0 for the uninsured/under-insured
– $0 for the Postal Service
– $0 for state and local governments
– 100% deduction for three-martini CEO lunches
What a disaster.

Roll Call‘s John Donnelly reported Monday that “Senate Republicans have laced their roughly $1 trillion coronavirus relief package with at least $7 billion for weapons, most of which are built by leading contractors that contribute heavily to congressional campaigns.”
According to Donnelly:
The draft appropriations portion, made public Monday evening, includes money for fighter jets, helicopters, radars, ships, and armored vehicles that the measure’s authors have deemed “emergency” spending that is not capped by the budget control law…
  The top two defense contractors, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co., would do especially well under the measure.
  The list of weapons is topped by fully $1 billion for an unstated number of Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance jets. Also on the list is $283 million for Boeing Apache helicopters for the Army.
  Boeing’s Ground-Based Midcourse Defense anti-missile system, which is aimed at intercepting incoming ballistic missiles from sites in Alaska and California, would receive $200 million, and $243 million more would go to a missile defense radar program.
“People are dying, or worried about keeping a roof over their families’ heads, or cutting hours because their kids’ schools are closed,” said Anthony Weir, a lobbyist on nuclear disarmament and Pentagon spending at the Friends Committee on National Legislation. “And this is the time to jam some military procurement into this year that you didn’t get last year?”

0,2020-07-29T10:51:33+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/watchdog-group-lays-out-the-4-main-aspects-of-an-impeachment-case-against-william-barr-putting-an-end-to-his-egregious-abuses-of-power/,Watchdog group lays out the 4 main aspects of an impeachment case against William Barr: ‘Putting an end to his egregious abuses of power’,"The same day William Barr is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington on Tuesday laid out guidelines for a formal impeachment inquiry into the attorney general to consider possible abuses of the powers of his office.
The government watchdog group in a new report suggests Congress draw from the second article of impeachment faced by President Richard Nixon in 1974 by focusing on whether Barr’s actions have been “seriously incompatible with our system of constitutional government.”
CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement that the Justice Department under Barr “has abandoned its role as the guardian and keeper of the law and its institutional commitment to administering the law free from favor, pressure, and politics.”
Bookbinder accused Barr of “abandoning any semblance of impartiality and instead using the department to protect the president and his interests” and said, “An impeachment inquiry is the only way to put an end to the dangerous path we are on.”
The inquiry should center on—at minimum—four areas. The report says that Barr has:
Corruptly subverted the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and of President Trump for obstruction of justice;
Interfered with the lawful functions of the Department of Justice by overturning the actions of career prosecutors in the cases of Roger Stone Jr. and Michael Flynn and by firing United States Attorney Geoffrey Berman;
Obstructed lawful investigations of the United States House of Representatives; and
Abused and exceeded the powers of the Attorney General to violate the First and Fourth Amendment rights of American citizens.
The final point focuses on the treatment of peaceful racial justice protesters. “On multiple occasions, Barr appears to have given unlawful orders to federal law enforcement to use violent riot control tactics to violate or impair” protesters’ constitutionally protected rights, says the report, pointing to his directive to police to forcefully clear demonstrators in Lafayette Square as one example.
The report frames an impeachment inquiry as “not just a matter of putting an end to his egregious abuses of power” but of “preventing the precedent Barr has set from becoming a model for future attorneys general to emulate. It is about restoring the administration of justice free from favor, pressure, and politics,” the report states.
“In order to fully restore the Justice Department’s impartiality and independence, Congress must confront Barr’sabuses of power,” said Bookbinder. “Barr has proven himself unfit to fulfill the duties he swore to uphold, and only by considering his impeachment can Congress begin to undo the damage he has done to our democratic system.”
Barr’s Monday hearing before Congress was set to begin at 10 am but was delayed until later in the day after committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) was in a car accident.
According to his prepared remarks, Barr will tell that panel that President Donald Trump “has not attempted to interfere” in his decisions and that police departments are not plagued with “deep-seated racism.”

Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans’ price for supporting unemployment checks and other benefits for average working people has been several trillion dollars shoveled directly into corporate coffers, both through tax breaks, grants, and the Federal Reserve buying trillions worth of corporate stocks and bonds.
Now Republicans are saying they want to cut people’s unemployment benefits, and they’ll only go along with giving unemployed people a measly $200 a week if they can also give immunity to corporate CEOs and managers when their stupid decisions cause people to die.
In other words, virtually every Republican initiative has been to put corporations and their CEOs first and working people last, even fighting to defend corporations and CEOs when they kill human beings.
But what if we did the opposite?
What if we ignored corporations and their billionaire CEOs and owners altogether, gave them nothing, and instead directed all our efforts to providing unemployment and other benefits to individual human beings?
In the real world, businesses can only exist and prosper when people have money to buy their products. Economists call this “aggregate demand,” and it generally refers to wages. But unemployment benefits work the same way: they put money in people’s hands, and people use that money to buy things, which causes corporations to make, move, and sell those things.
If we stopped subsidizing billionaires and giant corporations, and only subsidized poor and average working people, we would actually be stimulating the economy in a more efficient manner than giving trillions of dollars to corporations.
Instead of money trickling down from billionaires and corporations, it would flow upward from consumers, which is how economies are supposed to work and how ours worked for centuries before the 1981 imposition of Reaganomics.
Old, inefficient, and monopolistic companies would be in trouble, but that would open a space in the marketplace for millions of new, innovative and smaller businesses to step in and meet the demand created by consumers spending their unemployment checks.
If we stopped subsidizing businesses and started subsidizing people, it would produce a realignment of America’s business structure that would help smaller, local and regional companies tremendously, which overall would be a great thing for our economy and would reignite entrepreneurial opportunities.
The 40-year experiment of Reaganomics that required putting corporations and CEOs first has failed, and Democrats need to push back hard against Mitch McConnel’s efforts to further subsidize giant companies that, in a real free market economy, would be out of business, thus providing space and opportunity for young, new and entrepreneurial ventures.The only reason Republicans have been shoveling money at giant corporations is because those corporations have been spiffing them on the back end. Ever since the Supreme Court legalized corporate bribery of politicians in 1978 with the First National Bank versus Belotti decision written by Louis Powell, this has been the nature of business’ relationship with the GOP and even some corporate Democrats. Corporations contribute money, and legislators write laws that give tax breaks, giant cash subsidies and less liability to those same corporations.

0,2020-07-29T01:35:43+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/why-you-should-make-your-voting-plan-now/,Why you should make your voting plan now,"Americans who want to vote this fall should make a plan, including what to do if something goes wrong—such as their requested mailed-out ballot does not arrive or is late—according to a range of election experts and grassroots activists.
“Pre-pandemic, we could all stop at the grocery store without having to think about it. Now we all have to make a plan,” said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. “Similarly, voters are going to need to make a plan that they haven’t necessarily had to do before.”
“We must change our language from ‘[the] November Election,’ ‘Election Day,’ and ‘November 3rd’ to ‘the fall election’ or ‘the general election,’” says Mimi Kennedy, an actress and activist on the board of Progressive Democrats of America, in a voter guide that suggests making a calendar that starts with checking one’s voter registration information. “All voting requires advance planning from now on.”
This voter-centric advice contrasts with much recent media coverage surrounding voting this fall. Those narratives have been dominated by President Trump saying he might not accept the results, predictions of November meltdowns, and the question of whether or not Congress will appropriate more funds for the fall’s state and local elections.
Stepping back, experts like Becker say that the landscape and options for voting this fall are mostly known. The smartest course is for voters to think about making plans to vote and for election officials to anticipate that there won’t be many more procedural changes.
Voters have three options this fall: Voting with ballots that are mailed to their home; voting early, in person; and voting in person on Election Day, November 3.
Within these three choices is a second set of decisions. If you receive a ballot by mail, do you have to return it by mail? Or can you return it in person? The return choices typically are a mix of drop boxes, early voting sites, Election Day sites and election offices. Election rules vary among states and counties, but details can be found on government election websites.
Voting starts with registration (in all states except North Dakota, which does not require voter registration). Kennedy’s voting guide suggests that voters check their registration information after August 5. That’s 90 days before November 3, after which it is illegal to remove voters from the rolls. September is “Order Your Mail Ballot Month,” Kennedy advises. October is the month to “Vote Your Mail Ballot” or vote early in person.
“We’ve made a Voters’ Calendar for the Voting Season,” Kennedy says. “It stretches our attention span so high-turnout elections can become a task that mere mortals can perform.”
The newest reason why it is more important than ever to verify one’s registration status is because registration forms include information that determines how election officials will be contacting voters this fall. That’s the address to which ballots will be automatically be sent in some states. It’s the address to which applications for a mailed-out ballot will be sent in other states. This information is what’s used to check in voters at polls and validate all of the ballots that are filled out at home and returned to election officials.
Becker suggested that whenever possible, voters use government websites to interact with election officials for several reasons. First, voters should directly engage with the officials who will issue and count their votes, he said. Second, these websites and their data are likely to be more secure and accurate amid an environment that is seeing increasing disinformation. The National Association of Secretaries of State has a “Can I Vote” portal that redirects voters to their official state sites to solve most issues.
Looking past the registration stage, voters will have to decide how they want to vote—with a mailed-out ballot or in person. This spring, many election specialists assumed that voting from home would solve the unexpected challenges of voting in a pandemic. But spring and summer primaries have shown that many voters, especially in cities, want to vote in person. Thus, the options for the fall are a mix of voting by mail or in person: either early or on Election Day.
“Decide if mail voting is for you. Mail voting might not be for you,” Becker said. “If you haven’t filled out [absentee] ballots often, if you don’t feel confident about mail delivery in your area, mail voting is probably not for you… Do what’s right for you. That’s really important.”
If your mailed-out ballot doesn’t arrive within a week of Election Day on November 3, then shift gears and be prepared to find an early, in-person voting center.
Kennedy, who has been a poll worker for a decade in Los Angeles, says each state will have varying rules on how it will process a voter who was listed as voting from home but shows up in person. Some states will let voters exchange an unvoted, mailed-out ballot for a regular, in-person ballot. Others will ask them to cast a provisional ballot—where a voter’s eligibility is checked before it counts.
“This is voter PPE—Personal Protective Education—in the time of pandemic,” she says. “Voting Season is not just about November 3rd anymore, not for vote-counting (it might take weeks) and not for vote-casting. Protection of your voting rights starts three months out. Plan to vote and follow your plan. We all know why this election matters.”
“We can either complain about a bad process and be angry or work to improve the process and educate voters, and be successful,” Becker said. “I am one of those people who on November 4 would be happier if we all thought election officials had performed a job well done.”

This includes one suit representing a number of immigrant rights organizations that advocate for undocumented communities in Massachusetts and have been working tirelessly to ensure families are represented in the count.
“We have spent countless hours and dollars encouraging our community members to complete Census 2020. With a stroke of a pen, the Trump administration has undermined all of our efforts in a racist attempt to prevent our communities from receiving the representation and resources they need and deserve,” Pastor Dieufort J. Fleurissaint of Haitian-Americans United said in a statement received Daily Kos. “This cannot stand.”
“Undocumented immigrants are now and have always been persons as a matter of fact, law, and basic human decency,” Lawyers for Civil Rights, which is suing on behalf of Massachusetts groups Haitian-Americans United, the Brazilian Worker Center, the Chelsea Collaborative, and Centro Presente, said in the statement. “Nevertheless, the Trump administration has continued to weaponize the census.”
“In a July 21, 2020 presidential memorandum, the Trump administration declared that it would seek the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base, the population count used to determine the number of representatives allocated to each state,” Lawyers for Civil Rights continued. But “[l]ike many of the president’s actions and statements on immigration, this latest order is meant largely for the consumption of nativists in his GOP base,” The Washington Post editorial board slammed.
And like many of Trump’s other racist actions, it’s also “patently illegal,” Lawyers for Civil Rights staff attorney Lauren Sampson said. “The fourth sentence of the Constitution makes clear that the decennial census is intended to count and include all persons, not just all citizens.” Another major lawsuit against the administration over the unconstitutional effort is being led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who leads at least 19 states and a number of cities and counties in suing.
“The coalition also makes clear, in today’s lawsuit, that public statements and actions by President Trump and his administration have established that the rationale for excluding undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base has always been motivated by racial animus against immigrants of color, and a desire to curb the political power of immigrant communities of color,” a statement said. “Further, the president’s announcement is clearly intended to promote fear and deter participation in the census by immigrants and their families, as it comes just weeks before enumerators are scheduled to go into the field to encourage households to respond to the census.”
Immigrant rights advocacy group America’s Voice noted that “Trump doesn’t care that his White House memo on the Census seeking to bar undocumented immigrants from being counted towards apportionment seems guaranteed to lose in coming legal battles. Instead, as Frank Sharry noted yesterday, “Trump only cares about one thing: power.’”
That includes using the power he has now to quintuple down on racism while his administration’s failure to properly respond to the novel coronavirus has left over 150,000 people dead—and counting.

This is the result.
Similarly, Major League Baseball held their season opening last week. They’re already questioning whether that was a good move.
Monday morning’s news that at least 14 members of the Miami Marlins and their staff have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in recent days was chilling. The immediate consequences were the postponements of the Marlins’ home opener against the Orioles and the Phillies’ home game against the Yankees, who would have been occupying the clubhouse those Marlins just showered and dressed in Sunday.
The wider effect: Back-to-normal, or even semi-normal, in sports was shattered, just days after being reintroduced.
In the midst of all of that, Allison Shuster wonders why Democrats are resisting the Trump administration’s pressure to reopen schools in a few weeks. The president says it’s all political.
Corrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats don’t want to open schools in the Fall for political reasons, not for health reasons! They think it will help them in November. Wrong, the people get it!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2020
But writing about the pandemic’s impact on sports, Thomas Boswell summed up the situation well.
Why are we here? The answer is pretty simple, yet inexplicably unacknowledged in wide swaths of this country: The pandemic is in control, and it stays in control until you stop it, suppress it, dominate it and crush “the curve.”
America has not come within a million miles of that outcome — though many other countries have…The entire American experience of this pandemic has been: Stay ahead of this virus or it will crush you.
That is essentially what Joe Biden said not long ago.
Amazingly, [Trump] still hasn’t grasped the most basic fact of this crisis: To fix the economy, we have to get control over the virus.

One has to wonder how many people will have to lose their health, lives, and livelihoods before people like Trump, DeSantis, Abbott, Ducey, and Kemp begin to understand that basic fact—or if they ever will. It’s not like their ignorance is gaining them anything politically. All of them are sinking like rocks when it comes to job approval ratings.
If the stated goal of all of this nonsense is to reignite the economy in order to help Trump and Republicans in the November election, they are failing miserably and will continue to do so.
As an example of that failure, Trump and his spokespeople continue to say that testing for COVID-19 is no longer a problem.
We do more testing than any country in the World, by far, over 55 million tests. Fake News @CNN says we should do more testing. But even if we did 100 times more, they would then say it is still not enough. They are totally discredited, just want Sleepy Joe to win in November! https://t.co/eqtBtXrEzJ
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2020
But from Senate candidate John Ossoff in Georgia, we hear a completely different story. Ossoff’s wife is a medical professional and tested positive, so he needed to be tested. Here’s what happened.
I’m good at the internet and I’ll be honest — it wasn’t easy to figure out testing in Georgia. The state’s DPH web site is just plain bad. An isolated & ailing senior would have a lot of difficulty. I finally found the info I needed on Fulton County’s website.
I arrived at the testing site at 8:30 this morning (it opened at 9) and got my test by around 10. The line was much longer by then. I was told to expect results in 2-4 days. Clinics I called last night (some charging $200) and CVS stores in Georgia currently estimate 6-10 days.
Senior docs I’ve talked to confirm there’s a shortage of accurate rapid tests in Georgia, which is a big problem. Labs are having trouble with timely turnaround even for normal tests — and there are severe shortages of reagents (chemicals used for testing & processing).
We’re in Month Five of this pandemic. Testing shortages are totally inexcusable.
Everything we know about dealing with this pandemic is that it all starts with adequate and timely testing. Obviously that isn’t happening in Georgia, even as the number of cases continues to rise. What is that doing to the economy? Last week Georgia ranked second highest in the number of unemployment claims filed—lagging only behind Florida. That’s what happens when you fail to grasp the most basic fact about the pandemic: “Stay ahead of this virus or it will crush you.”

0,2020-07-29T00:10:46+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-where-the-veep-race-stands/,Here’s where the veep race stands,"Ryan Lizza created a stir in Politico on Monday when he reported that former Senator Christopher Dodd, who is vetting potential vice-presidential candidates for Joe Biden, is unimpressed with Kamala Harris. In particular, Dodd allegedly doesn’t like how Harris responded when asked about her decision to go after Biden on the busing issue in the first Democratic debate.
This set off a furious response from supporters of Harris, including her online KHIVE fanbase. It was probably counterproductive, unless you think sending a mob to trash Chris Dodd is going to impress Biden. Of course, some figured the appearance of this article indicated that it was a lost cause in any case, but some interpreted the Dodd story as a desperate attempt to derail a nearly completed process that will put Harris on the ticket.
I don’t know where Harris currently stands, but Politico is back today with a story from Nahal Toosi on Susan Rice. Considering how many sources friendly to Rice cooperated on the article, it’s a pretty clear lobbying effort. The Rice camp is probably pleased with the result, as the piece reads like an advertisement. Taken together, the Lizza and Toosi articles are turning Politico into an enemy of the Harris camp.
Yet, their coverage of Karen Bass has been more critical. Quint Forgey focused on something the California congresswoman said at the time of Fidel Castro’s death:
In an interview on MSNBC, the five-term House lawmaker and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus addressed her decision to describe Castro as “Comandante en Jefe” in a statement she issued marking his death in 2016.
The Spanish phrase, which translates in English to commander in chief, has been criticized as unduly deferential to the communist strongman who presided over various human rights abuses.
“I have talked to my colleagues in the House about that, and it’s certainly something that I would not say again,” Bass said. “I have always supported the Cuban people, and the relationship that Barack Obama and Biden had in their administration in terms of opening up relations.”
Of course, Bass was only asked about this comment in response to a Politico article from Marc Caputo “detailing outrage among Florida Democrats over former Vice President Joe Biden’s vetting of Bass to become his running mate.”
The Florida Democratic Party has spent two years fighting a renewed GOP effort to brand it as socialists, and the state and national parties are spending big this year in Miami to defend two congressional seats and win two crucial state Senate contests in districts with sizable Cuban-American populations. All four lawmakers condemned Bass’ Castro remarks.
“The comments are troubling. It shows a lack of understanding about what the Castro regime was about. So I have to learn more about her position and perspective on Fidel Castro,” said Miami state Rep. Javier Fernandez, whose bid for an open state Senate seat could bring Democrats closer than ever to flipping control of the chamber.
So, somehow a contest that pits three talented, well-credentialed and ambitious black women against each other, is playing out by proxy in the pages of Politico. Yet, Elizabeth Warren is still in the running. Last week, the Associated Press weighed in with an examination of how she became “an unlikely confidant and adviser to Biden.” On June 15, she helped Biden raise $6 million in a single event.
Two weeks ago, Natasha Korecki of Politico announced “Tammy Duckworth bursts into VP contention” and “The Purple Heart recipient has captured the imagination of donors and the Biden team.” There’s been a little less buzz about her in the last few days, but she’s probably with the others on the finalists’ list.
There’s been some discussion of governors Gina Raimondo and Michelle Lujan Grisham, as well as Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Florida representatives Val Demings, but they certainly haven’t been as successful at self-promotion as the others. Maybe that’s a plus in Biden’s mind, but it seems like their hopes have faded.

0,2020-07-28T23:52:14+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/new-orleans-nightmare-prosecutor-announces-plans-to-step-down-in-surprising-statement/,New Orleans’ nightmare prosecutor announces plans to step down in surprising statement,"In prosecutor accountability circles, the name Leon Cannizzaro carries almost mystical significance. Cannizzaro, the district attorney of Orleans Parish (New Orleans) for the last 12 years, led the biggest prosecutors’ office in the most incarcerated state in the most incarcerated country on the planet, while filing bogus charges against ideological opponents in the public defender’s office. He routinely tricked reluctant, fearful witnesses and even victims to talk to his office through the use of “fake subpoenas” that threatened jail for noncompliance. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.
In a surprising statement on July 24, Cannizzaro announced that he would grant mercy to his city in the form of not seeking reelection. This transformed a race that was expected to be the incumbent versus an embattled reformer who is facing federal tax fraud charges, City Council President Jason Williams.
Three more candidates, all current criminal court judges, have since joined the fray: Keva Landrum, Arthur Hunter and Morris Reed. All of the candidates in the race are Black—an encouraging development for a city whose criminal justice system is rife with racism. Any would surely represent an improvement. At the same time, none are entirely convincing as sweeping-change candidates.
Judge Landrum served as the chief judge of the county from 2008 to 2019. In that role, she embraced incrementalist efforts to reduce pretrial detention based on wealth for people charged with low-level crimes, and worked with the MacArthur Foundation-backed Safety and Justice Challenge to that effect. The catch, however, is that Landrum is a strong backer of risk assessment tools as the solution to draconian criminal justice policy.
In a 2018 press statement from former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu about the rollout of a risk assessment tool to assist judges in making pretrial detention decisions, Landrum is quoted, stating, “We want a tool that is a workable model that provides more insight so judges can adequately assess the risk level of a defendant.”
The idea conveyed is that the risk assessment tool would reduce pretrial confinement for people held on low-level, nonviolent charges. The tool explicitly uses many dry, immutable factors such as “prior misdemeanor conviction,” “prior failure to appear older than two years,” and “prior sentence to incarceration.”
Tools like these may not appear racist, but are undeniably so in practice. As Matt Watkins from the Center of Court Innovation in New York City said of such algorithms, “There’s no way to square the circle there, taking the bias out of the system by using data generated by a system shot through with racial bias.”
In New Orleans, Black men are “arrested at twice the rate of white men while black women are arrested at 1.6 times the rate of white women.” And Black men constitute 94 percent of all felony marijuana possession arrests. Even when accounting for DA Cannizzaro’s notably low rate of guilty verdicts at trial of around 50 percent, Courtwatch NOLA found that over 80 percent of local criminal cases are disposed of via guilty pleas. These racial disparities continue throughout the criminal justice process.
Judge Hunter, like City Councilman Jason Williams, is running on a change platform, focusing partly on criminal justice reform and decarceration. His campaign’s Facebook page touts how he issued judicial rulings that declared racially biased criminal statutes unconstitutional, and was the first trial judge to order compensation for a previously incarcerated, exonerated defendant.
Elsewhere, he has said that he wants to no longer prosecute low-level marijuana possession cases, and to start a conviction integrity unit. Hunter also apparently “fought for equitable funding for public defenders to level the playing field with prosecutors”—though not effectively, as the state’s public defenders are still in an acute funding crisis, an issue further exacerbated by COVID-19. (Shockingly, Louisiana public defenders are paid extra to lose cases, since they do not receive their full payment unless their clients are convicted.) As a former New Orleans police officer, there are questions as to whether Hunter would be able to maintain the necessary professional boundaries between the DA’s office and the NOPD.
Judge Reed has a similar background to Judge Hunter in that he is also a former NOPD cop. He was also, at different points, a DEA agent and a state and federal prosecutor. Reed is also known for his work as the leader of the local branch of the NAACP.
In 2016, Reed led a group of protesters outside of former Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand’s office, after the sheriff freed without charge the man who shot and killed former NFL player Joe McKnight. Days later, Normand, a white man, infamously used the N-word at a presser about McKnight’s death, then ranted about “black-on-black crime”—a favored deflection point for racists. There is, however, no real evidence of the extent of Judge Reed’s commitment to ending mass incarceration.
DA Cannizzaro’s departure is undeniably good news for New Orleans. But each of the candidates to replace him has work to do to demonstrate and detail their intent. And whoever is elected in November will find that reforming the city’s acrid criminal justice system is a truly daunting task.

When it comes to legislating, not so much.
After wasting more than two months since House Democrats first passed their $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill, McConnell and the White House put their heads together to produce a bill so indefensible, GOP senators are running away from it like a burning building.
In fact, the morning after the bill went public, McConnell couldn’t even defend his own bill with a straight face. When he was asked why it included a $1.75 billion-dollar provision to relocate the eyesore of an FBI building that sits a block away from Trump International Hotel, McConnell played dumb.
“Uh, I’m not sure that it is, is it?” McConnell responded. After being informed that it was, he downgraded the bill to “a starting place” that could be built upon.
“We can’t pass a bill in the Senate without Democrats,” he acknowledged. “The Republicans are in the majority in the Senate, this is the starting place.” That sure oozes confidence—yeah, our bill kind of sucks and Democrats are going to have to bail us out.
As for the couple-billion dollar gift to Trump, McConnell immediately pointed his finger at the White House. “They’ll have to answer the question on why they insisted on that provision,” he offered.
That was the high point for the bill. Immediately after, Senate Republicans started dropping like flies.
Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana stood up at the GOP caucus luncheon and demanded to know what was in the bill. “I want to know what’s in the bill. That’s number one,” Kennedy said. “I’m not going to vote for something in the name of unity when I don’t know what’s in the damn thing.”
Not sure why Kennedy is suddenly objecting to blindly supporting things in the name of unity, but kudos to McConnell for making that possible.
Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also said he wasn’t “inclined” to support it, adding, “It’s a mess.” And Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska noted, “There are a hundred problems with the plan.” Oh.
But forget three defections—it’s more like a giant boatload is coming. “If Mitch can get half the conference, that’d be quite an accomplishment,” predicted Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday afternoon, McConnell was already disavowing pieces of his own bill. “I am opposed to non-germane amendments” he told reporters, specifically naming the FBI building provision. “When we get to the end of the process, I would hope all of the non-covid-related measures are out.”
So let’s get this straight: McConnell piddled around for nearly three months, then hustled together a dodgy bill that half his caucus hates, leaving him dependent on Democrats for more than half the votes to pass it—and yet he entirely excluded Democrats from the initial discussions?
Meanwhile, the health and welfare of millions of American households hang in the balance while McConnell bombs his legislating 101 class. Seriously, has Speaker Nancy Pelosi ever introduced a bill only to disavow it hours later as her members flee like rats from pesticide?
The answer to that is a hard “no.” Because even though she has a much more diverse caucus than McConnell, Pelosi actually knows how to legislate. Even when internal disagreements occur, she manages to smooth most of them over behind closed doors. And she doesn’t introduce bills before they’re ready for prime time.
McConnell’s never been good at legislating because it requires actual negotiation instead of simply jamming things down people’s throats.
Watch McConnell downgrade his own bill in real time—how embarrassing.

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Federal authorities are using a new tactic in their battle against protesters in Portland, Oregon: arrest them on offenses as minor as “failing to obey” an order to get off a sidewalk on federal property — and then tell them they can’t protest anymore as a condition for release from jail.
Legal experts describe the move as a blatant violation of the constitutional right to free assembly, but at least 12 protesters arrested in recent weeks have been specifically barred from attending protests or demonstrations as they await trials on federal misdemeanor charges.
“Defendant may not attend any other protests, rallies, assemblies or public gathering in the state of Oregon,” states one “Order Setting Conditions of Release” for an accused protester, alongside other conditions such as appearing for court dates. The orders are signed by federal magistrate judges.
For other defendants, the restricted area is limited to Portland, where clashes between protesters and federal troops have grown increasingly violent in recent weeks. In at least two cases, there are no geographic restrictions; one release document instructs, “Do not participate in any protests, demonstrations, rallies, assemblies while this case is pending.”
Protesters who have agreed to stay away from further demonstrations say they felt forced to accept those terms to get out of jail.
“Those terms were given to me after being in a holding cell after 14 hours,” Bailey Dreibelbis, who was charged July 24 with “failing to obey a lawful order,” told ProPublica. “It was pretty cut-and-dried, just, ‘These are your conditions for [getting out] of here.’
“If I didn’t take it, I would still be in holding. It wasn’t really an option, in my eyes.”
It could not be learned who drafted the orders barring the protesters from joining further demonstrations. The documents reviewed by ProPublica were signed by a federal magistrate in Portland. Magistrates have broad authority to set the terms of release for anyone accused of a crime. They typically receive recommendations from U.S. Pretrial Services, an arm of the U.S. Courts, which can gather input from prosecutors and others involved in the case. ProPublica identified several instances in which the protest ban was added to the conditions of release document when it was drafted, before it was given to the judge. It remained unclear whether the limits on protesting were initiated by Justice Department officials or the magistrates hearing the cases.
Constitutional lawyers said conditioning release from jail on a promise to stop joining protests were overly broad and almost certainly a violation of the First Amendment right to free assembly.
“The government has a very heavy burden when it comes to restrictions on protest rights and on assembly,” noted Jameel Jaffer of Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute. “It’s much easier for the government to meet that burden where it has individualized information about a threat. So for example, they know that a particular person is planning to carry out some unlawful activity at a particular protest.”
Over the past week, the federal government has sharply increased the number of protesters it’s charging with federal crimes — often for petty offenses that are classified as federal misdemeanors only because they occur on federal property. Court documents reviewed by ProPublica show that over a third of the protesters are charged with “failing to obey a lawful order,” which 14 protesters were charged with between July 21 and July 24 alone.
The office of the U.S. attorney for Oregon, Billy J. Williams, did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about who was making charging decisions. In a recent interview with The Oregonian, Williams urged local citizens to demand that “violent extremists” who have attempted to break through the fence outside the federal courthouse leave. “Until that happens, we’re going to do what we need to do to protect federal property.”
Craig Gabriel, an assistant U.S. attorney who works for Williams, insisted the office understood and respected the right to protest racial injustice. “People are angry. Very large crowds are gathering, expressing deep and legitimate anger with police and the justice system,” Gabriel told The Oregonian. “We wholeheartedly support the community’s constitutionally protected rights to assemble together in large, even rowdy protests and engage in peaceful and civil disobedience.”
Gabriel did not mention the written restrictions against protest that have been made a condition of release for some of those arrested.
Several protesters who were let go on July 23 had bans against demonstrating added by hand on their release documents by Magistrate Judge John V. Acosta, who signed off on them, a review by ProPublica found. Acosta’s office did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.
For those released on July 24, the restriction was added to the original typed document, also signed by Acosta. One protester arrested and released earlier in the month had his conditions of release modified at his arraignment on July 24. The modified order, signed by Acosta, added a protest ban not previously included.
Three of the 15 protesters charged on July 27, in orders signed by Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo, also had explicit protest restrictions added to their release terms. (One release order has not yet been posted to the federal courts database.) Russo’s office did not reply to ProPublica’s questions.
“I don’t see that as constitutionally defensible,” Jaffer said. And I find it difficult to believe that any judge would uphold it.”
The ACLU’s Somil Trivedi said, “Release conditions should be related to public safety or flight” — in other words, the risk that the defendant will abscond. “This is neither.” He described the handwritten addition of a protest ban to a release document as “sort of hilariously unconstitutional.”
Publicly, the Trump administration has claimed that it has no problem with the protests that erupted in Portland and other American cities in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis. The administration said it launched Operation Diligent Valor in July with a massive deployment of federal officers merely to protect federal property from “violent extremists.”
Geoffrey Stone of the University of Chicago Law School said that imposing a protest ban as a release condition undermines the distinction between protected protest and criminal activity. “Even if they’re right that these people did, in fact, step beyond the bounds of the First Amendment and do something illegal, that doesn’t mean you can then restrict their First Amendment right.”
In many cases, the charges leveled at Portland protesters are closely tied to their presence at the protest — and not to any violent acts.
Eighteen of the 50 protesters charged in Portland are accused only of minor offenses under Title 40, Section 1315, of the U.S. Code. That law criminalizes certain behavior (like “failure to obey a lawful order,” as well as “disorderly conduct”) when it happens on federal property or against people who are located on that property. In other words, it describes behavior that wouldn’t otherwise be a matter for a federal court.
Dreibelbis, like other protesters to whom ProPublica has spoken, said he was arrested for being on the sidewalk outside the federal courthouse. Because the federal government owns the land under the sidewalk, another protester (who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid influencing his upcoming trial) told ProPublica it’s “common knowledge” among protesters that the sidewalk is a no-go zone, and setting foot on it risks federal prosecution.
Dreibelbis told ProPublica he roller-skated into the protest, expecting to attend only briefly. He said he knelt on the sidewalk and was arrested by officers. (The charging document filed against Dreibelbis offers no arrest details.)
Section 1315 is the same law the Trump administration is using to justify initiating the federal show of force in Portland, which the administration has said it intends to employ in other cities where protests have raged since Floyd’s death.
The law allows the secretary of homeland security to supplement the Federal Protective Service, the relatively small agency partly responsible for federal building security, with law enforcement agents from the department’s other agencies (such as Customs and Border Protection).
Both President Donald Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama, have invoked that part of the law in the past. But the use of that same law to file criminal charges appears to be novel. The Obama administration sent a “surge force” of 400 FPS agents, and a dozen CBP agents, to Baltimore in 2015, when the police killing of Freddie Gray sparked broad unrest, but no charges were filed under Section 1315 itself in that response.
In Portland, the federal government has relied on the FPS and U.S. Marshals to write affidavits used to charge protesters in federal court. But it has detailed other agencies on the protest front lines: DHS agencies cited in court complaints include CBP, through its BORTAC tactical unit; Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s investigations unit; DHS’ Office of Intelligence and Analysis, in addition to FPS. Complaints also cite the U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which are Justice Department entities.
In the first weeks of the operation, the most common charge against protesters was assault of a federal officer — which, in some cases, counted as a crime on federal property because protesters on the streets were shining lasers at officers inside the courthouse. (DHS has claimed that some officers may permanently lose their vision, but as of July 24, the most serious injury detailed in federal charging documents was an agent who reported seeing spots in his eyes for 15 minutes after the laser attack.)
Over July 23 and 24, however, 10 of the 13 cases opened were charges only of “failing to obey a lawful order.” (One other defendant was charged with assaulting a U.S. Marshal while detained inside the courthouse — where she had been taken after an arrest for “failing to obey a lawful order.”)
Since then, almost all cases have accused protesters of assaulting a federal officer (generally a misdemeanor charge).
In many of the assault cases, files are thin and no details of the allegations have been posted, even for protesters charged as early as July 6. No case files identify an alleged victim — either by name or by the “unique identifier” on their uniforms. (DHS officials have claimed it’s unfair to describe the federal agents in Portland as “unidentified” because they clearly show identification.)
Some assault accusations charge protesters with throwing unidentified objects at officers in body armor, who were unharmed.
Even those defendants who aren’t explicitly barred from attending protests are unable to return to the epicenter of Portland’s unrest as a condition of their release. They are placed under a curfew (either from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. or 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.) and told not to go within five blocks of the courthouse grounds except for court hearings.
Experts said that while restrictions of that sort are common, they’re still questionably constitutional. “Though ‘stay away’ orders from a place where a potential crime has been committed are generally standard,” the ACLU’s Trivedi said, “‘stay away’ orders from public places that are part of the public square are more questionable.” But he and others conceded that the government could make an argument that it was necessary to prevent further wrongdoing.
They saw no legitimate rationale for a blanket ban on protests.
“I suppose the government could argue, ‘You disobeyed a law enforcement officer at a protest, and we don’t trust you to not do it again,’” Trivedi said. But the release documents already instruct defendants that they are not allowed to break any laws while awaiting trial.
“If they want to say ‘don’t break a law again,’ they’ve already said that,” Trivedi told ProPublica. “Beyond that, the only part that’s left would be not letting you exercise your First Amendment right.”
Driebelbis, for his part, must now watch the protests proceed without him. “I work across the water from the protests, and I can see it every” night, he told ProPublica. “I’m protesting from this side.”
He hastened to clarify that he didn’t mean he was attending a protest in violation of the court order. “Not protesting! There’s no protesting going on in the party of one. But I am there in spirit.”

On Monday night, Trump shared a video of the doctor who falsely claimed hydroxychloroquine is a “cure” for COVID-19 and that it obviated the need to wear masks or undertake other mitigation measures during the pandemic. Some of her claims were clearly wrong on their face — it’s important to reduce the risk of catching diseases even if we have a cure for them — and top experts argue that the evidence continues to give little indication that hydroxychloroquine is effective against the virus. The video Trump shared was so dangerously wrong that social media platforms began removing it.
Subsequent reporting revealed that the doctor in the video is a complete quack — she has previously promoted claims about alien DNA and demon sperm.
“The woman that you said is a ‘great doctor’ in that video that you retweeted last night said that masks don’t work and there’s a cure for COVID-19, both of which experts say is not true,” Collins told Trump during the evening briefing. “She’s also made videos saying that doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens and that they’re trying to make a vaccine to make you immune from becoming religious. So, what’s the logic in retweeting that?”
Trump shook his head and looked down.
“I can tell you this,” he said. “She was on air with many other doctors. They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine. And I thought she was very impressive in the sense that where she came — I don’t know what country she comes from — but she’s said that she’s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. And I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.”
Trump tried to move on to another reporter, but Collins had a follow-up. As she tried to cut in, he clearly grew annoyed. He decided to give up on getting a question from another reporter, said only, ‘Thank you very much, everybody,” and quickly left the room.
Watch the exchange below:

Don’t take it personally. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a friend or a stranger. I don’t care about your identity or your politics, where you work or if you work, whether you wear a mask or carry a gun.
I don’t trust you because you are, for the time being, a potential carrier of a deadly virus. You don’t have any symptoms? Maybe you’re an asymptomatic superspreader. Show me your negative test results and I’ll still have my doubts. I have no idea what you’ve been up to between taking the test and receiving the results. And can we really trust that the test is accurate?
Frankly, you shouldn’t trust me for the same reasons. I’m not even sure that I can trust myself. Didn’t I just touch my face at the supermarket after palpating the avocados?
I’m learning to live with this mistrust. I’m keeping my distance from other people. I’m wearing my mask. I’m washing my hands. I’m staying far away from bars.
I’m not sure, however, that society can live with this level. Let’s face it: trust makes the world go around. Protests break out when our faith in people or institutions is violated: when we can’t trust the police (#BlackLivesMatter), can’t trust male colleagues (#MeToo), can’t trust the economic system to operate with a modicum of fairness (#OccupyWallStreet), or can’t trust our government to do, well, anything properly (#notmypresident).
Now, throw a silent, hidden killer into this combustible mix of mistrust, anger, and dismay. It’s enough to tear a country apart, to set neighbor against neighbor and governor against governor, to precipitate a civil war between the masked and the unmasked.
Such problems only multiply at the global level where mistrust already permeates the system — military conflicts, trade wars, tussles over migration and corruption. Of course, there’s also been enough trust to keep the global economy going, diplomats negotiating, international organizations functioning, and the planet from spinning out of control. But the pandemic may just tip this known world off its axis.
I’m well aware of the ongoing debate between the “not much” and “everything” factions. Once a vaccine knocks it out of our system, the coronavirus might not have much lasting effect on our world. Even without a vaccine, people can’t wait to get back to normal life by jumping into pools, heading to the movie theater, attending parties — even in the United States where cases continue to rise dramatically. The flu epidemic of 1918-1919, which is believed to have killed at least 50 million people, didn’t fundamentally change everyday life, aside from giving a boost to both alternative and socialized medicine. That flu passed out of mind and into history and so, of course, might Covid-19.
Or, just as the Black Death in the fourteenth century separated the medieval world from all that followed, this pandemic might draw a thick before-and-after line through our history. Let’s imagine that this novel virus keeps circulating and recirculating, that no one acquires permanent immunity, that it becomes a nasty new addition to the cold season except that it just happens to kill a couple of people out of every hundred who get it. This new normal would certainly be better than if Ebola, with a 50% case fatality rate if untreated, became a perennial risk everywhere. But even with a fatality rate in the low single digits, Covid-19 would necessarily change everything.
The media is full of speculation about what a periodic pandemic future will look like. The end of theater and spectator sports. The institutionalization of distance learning. The death of offices and brick-and-mortar retail.
But let’s take a look beyond that — at the even bigger picture. Let’s consider for a moment the impact of this new, industrial-strength mistrust on international relations.
The Future of the Nation-State
Let’s say you live in a country where the government responded quickly and competently to Covid-19. Let’s say that your government established a reliable testing, contact tracing, and quarantine system. It either closed down the economy for a painful but short period or its system of testing was so good that it didn’t even need to shut everything down. Right now, your life is returning to some semblance of normal.
Lucky you.
The rest of us live in the United States. Or Brazil. Or Russia. Or India. In these countries, the governments have proven incapable of fulfilling the most important function of the state: protecting the lives of their citizens. While most of Europe and much of East Asia have suppressed the pandemic sufficiently to restart their economies, Covid-19 continues to rage out of control in those parts of the world that, not coincidentally, are also headed by democratically elected right-wing autocrats.
In these incompetently run countries, citizens have very good reason to mistrust their governments. In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration botched testing, failed to coordinate lockdowns, removed oversight from the bailouts, and pushed to reopen the economy over the objections of public-health experts. In the latest sign of early-onset dementia for the Trump administration, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany declared this month that “science should not stand in the way” of reopening schools in the fall.
Voters, of course, could boot Trump out in November and, assuming he actually leaves the White House, restore some measure of sanity to public affairs. But the pandemic is contributing to an already overwhelming erosion of confidence in national institutions. Even before the virus struck, in its 2018 Trust Barometer the public relations firm Edelman registered an unprecedented drop in public trust connected to… what else?… the election of Trump. “The collapse of trust in the U.S. is driven by a staggering lack of faith in government, which fell 14 points to 33% among the general population,” the report noted. “The remaining institutions of business, media, and NGOs also experienced declines of 10 to 20 points.”
And you won’t be surprised to learn that the situation hadn’t shown signs of improvement by 2020, with American citizens even more mistrustful of their country’s institutions than their counterparts in Brazil, Italy, and India.
That institutional loss of faith reflects a longer-term trend. According to Gallup’s latest survey, only 11% of Americans now trust Congress, 23% big business and newspapers, 24% the criminal justice system, 29% the public school system, 36% the medical system, and 38% the presidency. The only institution a significant majority of Americans trust — and consider this an irony, given America’s endless twenty-first-century wars — is the military (73%). The truly scary part is that those numbers have held steady, with minor variations, for the last decade across two very different administrations.
How low does a country’s trust index have to go before it ceases being a country? Commentators have already spent a decade discussing the polarization of the American electorate. Much ink has been spilled over the impact of social media in creating political echo chambers. It’s been 25 years since political scientist Robert Putnam observed that Americans were “bowling alone” (that is, no longer participating in group activities or community affairs in the way previous generations did).
The coronavirus has generally proven a major force multiplier of such trends by making spontaneous meetings of unlike-minded people ever less likely. I suspect I’m typical. I’m giving a wide berth to pedestrians, bicyclists, and other joggers when I go out for my runs. I’m not visiting cafes. I’m not talking to people in line at the supermarket. Sure, I’m on Zoom a lot, but it’s almost always with people I already know and agree with.
Under these circumstances, how will we overcome the enormous gaps of perception now evident in this country to achieve anything like the deeper basic understandings that a nation-state requires? Or will Americans lose faith entirely in elections, newspaper stories, hospitals, and public transportation, and so cease being a citizenry altogether?
Trust is the fuel that makes such institutions run. And it looks as though we passed Peak Trust long ago and may be on a Covid-19 sled heading downhill fast.
Globalization Unravels
The global economy also runs on trust: in financial transactions, the safety of workplace conditions, the long-distance transport of goods, and the consumer’s expectation that the purchased product will work as advertised.
To cause a breakdown in the global assembly line, Covid-19 didn’t have to introduce doubt into every step in this supply chain (though it would, in the end, do something like that). It only had to sever one link: the workplace. When the Chinese government shut down factories in early 2020 to contain the pandemic — leading to a 17% decline in exports in January and February compared to the previous year — companies around the world suddenly faced critical shortages of auto parts, smartphone components, and other key goods.
The workplace proved a weak link in the global supply chain for another reason: cost. Labor has traditionally been the chief expense in manufacturing, which, from the 1990s on, led corporations to outsource work to cheaper locations like Mexico, China, and Vietnam. Since then, however, the global assembly line has changed and, as the McKinsey consulting firm explains, “over 80% of today’s global goods trade is [no longer] from a low-wage country to a high-wage country.”
Labor’s centrality to the location of manufacturing had been further eroded by the growth of automation, which, according to economists, tends to surge during downturns. As it happens, both artificial intelligence and robotization were already on the rise even before the pandemic hit. By 2030, up to 20 million jobs worldwide will be filled by robots. The World Bank estimates that they will eventually replace an astounding 85% of the jobs in Ethiopia, 77% in China, and 72% in Thailand.
Then there are the environmental costs of that same global assembly line. Moving freight contributes 7% to 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with air transport being the most carbon intensive way to go. (Add to that, of course, the carbon footprint of the factories themselves.)
If all that doesn’t change the minds of CEOs about the benefits of globalization, then national security considerations might. The pandemic exposed how vulnerable countries are in terms of key commodities. Because China is responsible for producing more respirators, surgical masks, and protective garments than the rest of the world combined, countries began to panic when Covid-19 first hit because they no longer had sufficient national capacity to produce the basic tools to address the spreading pandemic themselves. The same applied to essential drugs. The United States stopped producing penicillin, for instance, in 2004.
The threat of infection, the spread of automation, the environmental impact, the risk of foreign control: the global assembly line just doesn’t seem to make much sense any more. Why not relocate manufacturing back home to a “dark factory” that’s fully automated, doesn’t need lights, heating, or air conditioning, and is practically pandemic-proof?
The current pandemic won’t spell the end of globalization, of course. Corporations, as the McKinsey report points out, will still find compelling reasons to relocate manufacturing and services overseas, including “access to skilled labor or natural resources, proximity to consumers, and the quality of infrastructure.” Consumers will still want pineapples in winter and cheap smart phones. But capitalists eyeing the bottom line, in combination with Trump-style nationalists insisting that capital return home, will increasingly disassemble what we all took for granted as globalization.
The world economy won’t simply disappear. After all, agriculture has persisted in the modern era. It just employs an ever-diminishing segment of the workforce. The same will likely happen to global trade in a pandemic age. In the early part of the last century, surplus labor no longer needed on the farms migrated to the cities to work in factories. The question now is: What will happen to all those workers no longer needed in the global assembly line?
Neither the international community nor the free market has a ready answer, but authoritarian populists do: stop all those displaced workers from migrating.
Wall World
From the moment he descended that Trump Tower escalator into the presidential race, Donald Trump’s effort to seal off the U.S. border with Mexico has been his signature policy position. That “big, fat, beautiful wall” of his may be simplistic, anti-immigrant, xenophobic, and mistrustful of the world — and may never really be completed — but unfortunately, he’s been anything but alone in his obsession with walls.
Israel pioneered modern wall building in the mid-1990s by sealing off Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, followed by a 440-mile-long barrier to wall off the West Bank. In 2005, responding to a wave of migrants escaping wars and poverty in North Africa and the Middle East, Hungary built new bulwarks along its southern borders to keep out the desperate. Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia, and Croatia have done the same. India has fenced off the Kashmir region from Pakistan. Saudi Arabia has constructed a 600-mile barrier along its border with Iraq.
In 1989, there were about a dozen major walls separating countries, including the soon-to-fall Berlin Wall. Today, that number has grown to 70.
In this context, the novel coronavirus proved a godsend to nationalists the world over who believe that if good fences make good neighbors, a great wall is best of all. More than 135 countries added new restrictions at their borders after the outbreak. Europe reestablished its internal Schengen area borders for the first time in 25 years and closed its external ones as well. Some countries — Japan and New Zealand, in particular — practically walled themselves off.
Even as the pandemic fades in certain parts of the world, many of those new border restrictions remain in place. If you want to travel to Europe this summer, you can only do so if you’re from one of a dozen countries on a European Union-approved list (and that doesn’t include Americans). New Zealand has had only a handful of cases over the last few months (with a high of four new cases on June 27th), but its borders remain closed to virtually everyone. Even a “travel bubble” with nearby Australia is off the table for now. Japan has banned entry to people from 129 countries, including the United States, but there’s an exemption for U.S. soldiers traveling to American military bases. A recent outbreak of coronavirus at such garrisons on the island of Okinawa may well prompt Tokyo to tighten its already strict rules further.
And such border restrictions are potentially just the beginning. So far, the pandemic has unleashed an everyone-for-themselves spirit — from export restrictions on essential goods to a feverish competition to develop a vaccine first. The United Nations has made various pleas for greater international cooperation, its secretary general even urging a “global ceasefire” among warring parties. The World Health Organization (WHO) attempted to organize a global response to the virus at its annual meeting. However, the Trump administration promptly announced that it would be pulling out of the WHO, very few combatants observed a Covid-19 ceasefire, and there is no coordinated international response to the pandemic outside of the community of scientists sharing research.
So, is this to be the future: each country transformed into a gated community? How long can a sense of internationalism survive in Wall World?
Rebuilding Trust
Conservatives used to make fun of the left for its penchant for relativism, for arguing that everything depends on context. “If you ask me what the biggest problem in America is, I’m not going to tell you debt, deficits, statistics, economics,” former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said in 2011, “I’ll tell you it’s moral relativism.” Once upon a time, the rightwing railed against deconstructionists who emphasized interpretation over facts.
What, then, to make of the Republican Party today? So many of its leaders, including the president, don’t believe in the science behind either climate change or Covid-19. Many of them embrace the most lunatic conspiracy theories and some current congressional candidates even believe, by way of the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon, that a cabal of satanic child molesters in Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and various international organizations controls the world. In July, Donald Trump achieved the dubious milestone of telling more than 20,000 lies during his tenure as president. In other words, speaking of relativism, the Republican Party has put its trust in a man untethered from reality.
And then along came that pandemic like lighter fluid to a brushfire. The resulting conflagration of mistrust threatens to spread out of control until nothing is left, not the nation-state, not the global economy, not the international community.
In this pandemic era, a fire somewhere is a fire everywhere, for the virus cares nothing about borders. But the key to restoring trust must begin where the trust deficit has grown largest and that certainly is the United States. Not only have Americans lost faith in their own institutions, so, it seems, has everyone else. Since 2016, there has been a 50% drop in the world’s trust in the United States, the largest decline ever in the US News and World Report’s Best Countries survey.
And the reason the United States has the worst record dealing with the coronavirus is quite simple: Donald Trump. He is the leader of an ever-diminishing proportion of the public that continues to believe the coronavirus is a hoax or refuses to comply with basic precautions to prevent its spread. A scofflaw president who refuses to mandate the use of facemasks (even after officially donning one for his Twitter feed) inspires a scofflaw minority that puts the majority at risk.
Restoring trust in this country’s public health system and governance must begin with a competent system of testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. Yet the Trump administration still refuses to take this necessary step. Senate Republicans have pushed for $25 billion to help establish testing and tracing systems at the state level, but the president actually wants to eliminate even this modest amount from the budget (along with additional funds for government agencies tasked with addressing the pandemic).
Americans increasingly mistrust their institutions because growing numbers of us believe that we derive ever fewer benefits from them. The Trump administration has typically done its best to make matters disastrously worse, only recently, amid the pandemic and with millions unemployed, demanding that the Supreme Court gut the health insurance provided by the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act. The bulk of the stimulus funds passed by Congress went to wealthy individuals and corporations — and the president’s men didn’t even exercise due diligence to prevent nearly $1.4 billion in stimulus checks from being mailed to dead people.
The next administration (assuming there is one) will have a massive clean-up job restoring faith of any sort in such an unequal, broken system. After addressing the acute crisis of the pandemic, it will have to demonstrate that the rule of law is again functioning. The most dramatic proof would, of course, be to throw the book at Donald Trump and his closest enablers. They have violated so many laws that trust in the legal system will be further weakened unless they’re tried and punished for their crimes, including their willingness to sacrifice American lives in staggering numbers in pursuit of The Donald’s reelection.
In 1996, Bill Clinton spoke of building a bridge to the twenty-first century. Two decades into this century, Donald Trump has effectively torn down that bridge and replaced it with a (still largely unbuilt) wall reminiscent of the fortifications of the Middle Ages. Covid-19 has only reinforced the insular paranoia of this president and his followers. The path back to trust, at both a domestic and international level, will be difficult. There will be monsters to battle along the way. But in the end, it’s possible for us to take this country back, create a just and sustainable global economy, and rebuild the international community.
You and I can do this. Together.
Trust me.

0,2020-07-28T21:05:56+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-8-potentially-impeachable-offenses-in-the-last-6-months/,Trump’s 8 potentially impeachable offenses in the last 6 months,"It has been almost six months since Senate Republicans refused to hold Trump accountable for the two articles of impeachment referred to them by the House. Senator Susan Collins of Maine didn’t attempt to defend the president’s actions, but instead, claimed that he had learned his lesson.
One month ago, Fred Hiatt set out to determine if there was any evidence that Collins was right. What he found was that Trump had committed four additional offenses that were worthy of an impeachment inquiry. This week, he revisited that list and added three more offenses, with updates to some of the original four. Here’s a summary of all of them.
Article 1: Negligence, leading to the deaths of thousands of Americans, in the handling of the novel coronavirus.
Article 2: Abuse of law enforcement powers, including both the use of force against peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square and in Portland, Oregon.
Article 3: Abuse of appointment power in seeking retribution against those who testified against him during the impeachment hearings.
Article 4: Abuse of power in foreign affairs. This includes both his willingness to ignore China’s treatment of the Uighurs in exchange for help with farmers during trade negotiations as well as the fact that he has totally ignored Russia placing bounties on the lives of American soldiers in Afghanistan.
Article 5: Abuse of power for personal enrichment in asking the ambassador to Britain to steer the British Open golf tournament to a Trump-owned resort in Scotland.
Article 6: Abuse of reprieve and pardon power in commuting the sentence of Roger Stone.
Article 7: Undermining faith in the electoral process by lying about fraud associated with mail-in ballots and a refusal to commit to abiding by the results of the election.
I would add an eighth article to the list: Failure to comply with Supreme Court rulings. In June, the Supreme Court refused to end the DACA program and also refused to dismiss the subpoenas from the Manhattan District Attorney’s office for the release of Trump’s financial records. On the former, this is what is being reported by the Los Angeles Times.
President Trump is venturing onto increasingly shaky legal ground as officials reject new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, sidestepping a Supreme Court ruling reinstating DACA, legal experts and lawmakers say.
On releasing his financial records, the president is obviously stalling.
US President Donald Trump on Monday filed a new challenge to the Manhattan District Attorney’s subpoena for his tax returns, weeks after the United States Supreme Court said the president was not immune from state criminal probes.
In their new court papers, Trump’s lawyers said the subpoena of his tax records was “wildly overbroad” and “amounts to harassment of the President”.
So in less than six months, this president has committed eight offenses that would be deemed worthy of an impeachment investigation. It is worth noting that the attorney general is complicit in at least four of them (2,3,6, and 7). Perhaps in addition to tracking Trump’s lies, the Washington Post should set up a system of tracking his impeachable offenses leading up to January 20, 2021.
As Hiatt noted, all of these articles share one thing in common with the original articles of impeachment: “Putting personal, political gain above the interests and values of the nation.” So over the last six months, Collins has been proven terribly wrong and Representative Adam Schiff nailed it.
You can’t trust this president to do the right thing. Not for one minute. Not for one election. Not for the sake of our country. You just can’t. He will not change and you know it… He has betrayed our national security. He has compromised our elections. And he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. Truth matters little to him. What’s right matters even less. And decency matters not at all.
None of this is to suggest that the House should start another round of impeachment hearings. With the election less than 100 days away and a pandemic ravaging the country, that would not be advisable. But history needs to be clear about this president’s crimes and misdemeanors, while Senate Republicans need to be held accountable for their complicity in allowing this to happen.

0,2020-07-28T20:55:08+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/political-scientist-explains-why-republicans-are-playing-with-fire-by-undercutting-the-right-to-vote/,Political scientist explains why ‘Republicans are playing with fire’ by undercutting the right to vote,"As the Republican Party moves more and more to the far right, it keeps trying to make it harder for non-whites to vote. Political science professor Thomas E. Patterson, who teaches at Harvard University in Massachusetts, discusses the GOP’s voter suppression efforts in an article for the Boston Globe — warning Republicans that their efforts to discourage non-white voting will backfire in the end.
“The idea of disenfranchising minority voters was hatched by the Republican-controlled legislatures of Indiana and Georgia,” Patterson explains. “Enacted in 2006, Indiana’s law required residents to have a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license or passport, in order to register to vote. Republican legislators knew who they were targeting. Minority group members, young adults and people of low income — all of whom tend to vote Democratic — are less likely than other Americans to have a passport or driver’s license.”
Patterson adds, “Since then, roughly 30 Republican-controlled states have enacted voter ID laws.” And he points out that when Democrats enjoy decisive victories, Republicans find ways to keep them from governing.
“There was, for example, no constitutional barrier to prevent Wisconsin’s outgoing Republican governor, Scott Walker, in consort with the state’s Republican legislature, to strip the governor’s office of power before the incoming Democratic governor could take office in 2019,” Patterson notes. “But it violated the longstanding norm of American politics that the outgoing party accept the change in power that comes with losing an election.”
The professor continues, “North Carolina’s Republican legislature pulled the same stunt in 2016, when the state’s voters elected a Democratic governor. Republican state legislatures, assisted by computer models, have also pushed gerrymandering beyond ethical limits.”
But Patterson warns that the non-white voters Republicans are trying to disenfranchise will fight back.
“Republicans are playing with fire,” Patterson declares. “Voter suppression lengthens the memory of the suppressed. The votes of black Americans are now all but lost to the GOP.”
Latinos, he adds, “vote 2 to 1 Democratic” — and Asian-Americans “are now one of the Democrats’ most loyal voting groups. Muslim Americans are five times more likely to vote Democratic than Republican.”
“It could take a generation for Republicans to regain the trust of the nation’s minorities, and the GOP can ill afford to wait,” Patterson warns. “By then, it may be too late. In less than three decades, minorities will be a majority of the U.S. population.”

0,2020-07-28T20:38:51+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/gop-senator-slammed-for-using-blatant-antisemitism-in-ad-against-a-democrat/,GOP senator slammed for using ‘blatant antisemitism’ in ad against a Democrat,"Sen. David Perdue of Georgia is among the incumbent Republican senators who is seeking reelection this year, and the race is becoming increasingly bitter. In fact, a recent attack ad against Perdue’s Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, is drawing criticism for using anti-Semitic imagery.
A fundraising ad from Perdue, according to the New York Times’ Rick Rojas, depicts Ossoff — who is Jewish — with an enlarged nose. The ad shows Ossoff with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is also Jewish, in a 2017 photo from Reuters and claims: “Democrats are trying to buy Georgia.”
Perdue said that the alteration came from someone outside of his campaign and was not meant to attack Ossoff for being Jewish, but Ossoff doesn’t believe him. In a statement on Monday night, Ossoff argued, “This is the oldest, most obvious, least original anti-Semitic trope in history. Senator, literally no one believes your excuses.” And the liberal/progressive Jewish organization Bend the Arc, in a tweet, slammed the ad as “blatant antisemitism”:
Senator David Perdue just ran an attack ad that artificially enlarged the nose of his Jewish opponent, Jon @Ossoff.
The ad claims that “Democrats are trying to buy Georgia.”
This is blatant antisemitism. It’s not an accident. It’s their platform.@Perduesenate, apologize now. pic.twitter.com/h0sOpllgHe
— Bend the Arc: Jewish Action (@jewishaction) July 28, 2020
But Perdue’s reelection campaign, in an official statement, said of the altered Reuters photo: “Obviously, this was accidental…. Anybody who implies that this was anything other than an inadvertent error is intentionally misrepresenting Sen. Perdue’s strong and consistent record of standing firmly against anti-Semitism and all forms of hate.”
Rojas notes that according to The Forward (a Jewish publication), graphic design experts confirmed that in the ad, Ossoff’s nose appeared longer and wider than it originally appeared in the 2017 photo.
“For centuries,” Rojas explains, “depictions of Jews that embellish their noses as large and hooked have been used as a form of anti-Semitic caricature. The ad in Georgia also came as researchers have found that anti-Semitism has surged across the country in recent years, manifesting itself through violence and vandalism as well as in more subtle ways.”
I believe @sendavidperdue absolutely did approve this ad. He is the absolutely worst Senator Georgia has had in decades and is scared he’s going to lose. He panders to any racist, bigot gets can to win. I will gladly vote for @ossoff.

Georgia, like Texas, is arguably a light red state at this point — Republican-leaning overall, but not deep red like Idaho, Wyoming, Mississippi or Utah. In 2018, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams (who is being mentioned as a possible running mate for former Vice President Joe Biden) narrowly lost to Gov. Brian Kemp. And Democratic strategists are hoping to flip the seat that Perdue presently holds.
Recent polls have found the race to be surprisingly close: a recent Civiqs poll, for example, found Ossoff leading Perdue by 2% — which was within the poll’s margin of error. A Fox News poll conducted in June found Perdue ahead by 3%.

Jayapal unleashes on Bill Barr for ignoring right-wing extremists,"A fiery exchange during Tuesday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing between Rep. Pramila Jayapal and Attorney General William Barr over the Justice Department’s differing responses to recent Black Lives Matter and armed right-wing protests earlier this year earned the Washington Democrat praise for taking on the nation’s top law enforcement officer.
“This is how it’s done,” tweeted advocacy group Public Citizen of the back and forth.
Stop what you’re doing right now and watch @RepJayapal tear down William Barr. This is how it’s done. pic.twitter.com/iaV93Q5vKF
— Public Citizen (@Public_Citizen) July 28, 2020
Jayapal termed Barr’s “aggressive approach to Black Lives Matter protesters” a distinct contrast to how the Justice Department is handling “right-wing extremists threatening to lynch a governor”—a reference to demonstrators in Kentucky this May who hung an effigy of Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat.
“Mr. Barr… I’m starting to lose my temper.”

The congresswoman, who serves as the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, also hammered Barr on the lack of a federal response to right-wing protests in Michigan where armed right-wing extremists stormed the state capitol.
“When white men with swastikas storm a government building with guns, there is no need for the president to ‘activate’ you, because they’re getting the president’s personal agenda done,” said Jayapal. “But when black people and people of color protest police brutality, systemic racism, and the president’s very own lack of response to those critical issues, then you forcibly remove them with armed federal officers [and] pepper bombs because they are considered terrorists by the president.”
Barr attempted to push back, claiming that the protests were not near a federal building and thus not under his authority—perhaps forgetting that the demonstrations in Michigan were, as Politico‘s Zack Stanton noted, around “100 yards away from the Chamberlain Federal Building.”
Just noting: the Michigan gun-toting Michigan protests that Rep. Jayapal referenced — and which AG Barr said didn’t fall under under his authority — happened ~100 yards away from the Chamberlain Federal Building/courthouse in Lansing. https://t.co/8pB8KXyJSi
— Zack Stanton (@zackstanton) July 28, 2020
Progressives welcomed the harsh tone from Jayapal against Barr, whose tenure atop the Justice Department has been criticized repeatedly for kowtowing to the whims of the president.
“Jayapal just went hard as hell,” tweeted journalist Ahmed Baba.

Neguse calls out his repeated lies,"Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO) took advantage of his opportunity on Tuesday to question Attorney General Bill Barr and exposed his relentless lying during the House Judiciary Committee hearing. In response, the attorney general appeared at times visibly uncomfortable and tried to shamelessly warp the truth.
“On April 18, 2019, you state that “the White House fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation,’ you’re aware of that?” Neguse asked.
“Mm-hmm,” said Barr.
“Today, yes or no, Mr. Barr, under the penalty of perjury, do you testify that that statement was true at the time you made it?”
“I thought it to be true at the time I made it,” Barr said, putting his hand on his face. “Why isn’t it true?”
“I’ll get to that,” said Neguse.
“Does it have to do with quibbling over—”
“Reclaiming my time!” said Neguse. “You answered the question. I have another question for you.”
But Barr pushed back, clearly getting irritated at the threat of perjuy, saying: “I’m going to answer the damn question. I think what I was referring to, and I’d have to see the context of it, was the supplying of documents.”
“No, Mr. Attorney General, the statement was not limited to the supply of documents,” replied Neguse.
“I think that’s what I was talking about,” said Barr.
Neguse started to become irritated himself, speaking rapidly and forcefully.
“You stated at a press conference on April [18] of 2019 that the White House fully cooperated with the special counsel’s investigation,” he said. “You knew, when you made that statement, that the president had not agreed to be interviewed by the special counsel. Now on June 18 of this year—”
“I think I subsequently said I was referring to the production of documents,” Barr interjected, his face appearing to twitch uncomfortably in frustration.
Neguse barreled forward with his questioning, but it’s worth noting that Barr’s attempt to justify his obvious lie is untenable. Here’s the full quote from Barr’s press conference:
Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel’s investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims. And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation.
Since Trump himself did not agree to sit down with an interview, which the special counsel sought, these claims are clearly false. And Barr knew it.
Neguse moved on to another lie: Barr’s claim that former U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman had “stepped down” from his position. After Barr made this announcement on June 19, Berman quickly contradicted it and said he had no intention of leaving voluntarily.
“Do you testify today that that statement was true at the time the department issued it?” Neguse asked.
“He may not have known it, but he was stepping down,’ Barr said, laughing, caught in his lie. “He was being removed!”
“Mr. Attorney General, the statement did not say that he was being removed, it did not say that he was being fired, it said that he was stepping down,” said Neguse. “Apparently, your statement today is that was in fact accurate, when Mr. Berman has testified under oath to this committee that it, in fact, was not.”
“He was being removed, and I wanted the opportunity to offer him another job and talk to him the next day,” said Barr.
“I understand your rationalization,” said Neguse.
Barr wasn’t pleased with that, declaring: “It’s not a rationalization.” But clearly, it was. Barr has already offered Berman another job, and Berman had turned him down. Barr thought that by lying about Berman already stepping down, he could will the circumstances he desired into existence. But it was a lie — one that blew up in his face. And now we all know it.

0,2020-07-28T19:22:12+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/this-conservative-trump-voter-reveals-he-thought-covid-19-was-a-hoax-until-it-got-his-family/,This conservative Trump voter reveals he thought COVID-19 was a ‘hoax’ — until it got his family,"Two months ago, Tony Green — right-wing author and columnist for the LGBTQ website Dallas Voice — still bought into the claim that COVID-19 was a “hoax” designed to hurt President Donald Trump. But that was before he became seriously ill from it along with members of his family, and now, Green is urging others to take the pandemic seriously so that they won’t have to suffer a similar fate.
In a recent column, Green (who voted for Donald Trump in 2016) recalls that in May and early June, he was still describing the pandemic as a “scamdemic.”
“I believed the virus to be a hoax,” Green explains. “I believed the mainstream media and the Democrats were using it to create panic, crash the economy and destroy Trump’s chances at reelection. And so, believing the pandemic to be a hoax, my partner and I hosted family members on Saturday, June 13. On Sunday, June 14, I woke up sick.”
Green, author of the 2019 book “Maxed Out: The Criminal Justice System Running Amok,” continues:
By Monday, June 15, my partner and my parents were all sick. That same Monday, my in-laws traveled to witness the birth of their first grandchild; they took with them my father-in-law’s mother and one of my partner’s sisters. That night, my father-in-law became ill. Then, my mother-in-law and their daughter began feeling sick. So, they cut their trip short. Two days later, my father-in-law’s mother got sick. The new mommy and daddy got sick too. We all tested positive for COVID-19. Only the newborn was spared.
On June 24, Green notes, he went to the hospital; COVID-19 “had attacked” his “central nervous system, and the staff stopped me from having a stroke.” Then, on July 1, his father-in-law’s mother died from COVID-19 pneumonia — and on July 14, Green adds, “five more of our family members tested positive for the virus. That evening, my father-in-law was put on a ventilator.”
Green describes the coronavirus symptoms that he now has first-hand knowledge of.
“Imagine the sound and vibration of an old-fashioned electric heater going through your whole body,” Green writes. “Imagine gasping for air with every step you take. Imagine rubbing Icy Hot all over your head to soothe a painful headache. Imagine your eyes in a bowl of water while you’re still seeing through them. Imagine collapsing and waking up in the ER only to find out COVID-19 attacked your central nervous system, and the doctor had just saved you from a stroke.”
That June 13 dinner party, Green stresses, shows how easily and how rapidly COVID-19 can spread.
“You cannot imagine the guilt I feel, knowing that I hosted the gathering that led to so much suffering,” Green writes. “You cannot imagine my guilt at having been a denier, carelessly shuffling through this pandemic, making fun of those wearing masks and social distancing. You cannot imagine my guilt at knowing that my actions convinced both our families it was safe when it wasn’t. For those who deny the virus exists or who downplay its severity, let me assure you: the coronavirus is very real and extremely contagious. Before you even know you have it, you’ve passed it along to your friends, family, co-workers and neighbors.”

0,2020-07-28T19:00:31+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/rep-swalwell-expertly-corners-bill-barr-and-details-evidence-of-trumps-crimes/,Rep. Swalwell expertly corners Bill Barr and details evidence of Trump’s crimes,"While much of Tuesday’s House Judiciary Committee Hearing with Attorney General Bill Barr was wasted with imprecise and circuitous questions that let him filibuster and avoid accountability, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) managed to use his brief time to zero in on a key issue. He exposed Barr’s excessive fealty and deference to President Donald Trump and effectively debunked the attorney general’s claims to be an impartial defender of the rule of law.
Swalwell began by addressing an issue that had been discussed previously in the hearing without much clarity: Barr’s interference in the sentencing recommendation of Roger Stone.
“Mr. Barr, have you ever intervened, other than to help the president’s friend get a reduced prison sentence, in any other case where a prosecutor had filed a sentencing recommendation with the court?” he asked.
“Not that I’d recall,”  Barr said. He tried to blame the unusual circumstance on the line prosecutors in the case who threatened to quit — but they threatened to quit precisely because the intervention in the case was so unusual and facially corrupt.
“Mr. Barr, Americans from both parties are concerned that, in Donald Trump’s America, there’s two systems of justice: one for Mr. Trump and his cronies, and another for the rest of us. But that can only happen if you enable it,” Swalwell said, as Barr scoffed. “At your confirmation hearing, you were asked: Do you believe that a president could lawfully issue a pardon in exchange for the recipients’ promise not to discriminate him? You said no, that would be a crime.”
“Yes, I said that,” Barr said.
“And when you said that, that a president swapping a pardon to silence a witness would be a crime, you were promising the American people that if you saw that, you would do something about it. Is that right?” asked Swalwell.
“That’s right,” said Barr.
“Now, Mr. Barr, are you investigating Donald Trump for commuting the prison sentence of his long time friend and political adviser Roger Stone?”
Barr’s answer was quick: “No.”
This, in itself, was a huge tell. When former FBI Director James Comey was asked by Congress if he was investigating Trump in 2017, he refused to answer — even though he wasn’t. He did this for a good reason. It is unfair to confirm that any person is under investigation before charges are announced, except in extenuating circumstances. So officials shouldn’t deny the existence of a particular investigation into an individual and should always refuse to answer, so that if there ever is such an investigation, the official can credibly keep it secret. But this isn’t a concern for Barr in this case because Barr knows he’ll never investigate the president — no matter what.
Swalwell didn’t mention this fact, but he laid out a compelling case that not only should Trump be investigated for the Stone commutation, but that he is likely guilty.
“Mr. Stone was convicted on seven counts of lying in the Russia investigation. He bragged that he lied to ‘save Trump’s butt.’ But why would he lie? Your prosecutors, Mr. Barr, told a jury that Stone lied because the truth looked bad for Donald Trump. And what truth is that?” said Swalwell. “Well, Donald Trump denied in written answers to the Russia investigators that he talked to Roger Stone during the time Roger Stone was in contact with agents of Russia influence operation. There’s evidence that Trump and Stone did indeed talk during that time. You would agree that it’s a federal crime to lie under oath — is that right?”
“Yes,” said Barr.
“It’s a crime for you, it’s crime for me, and it’s certainly a crime for the president of the United States,” said Swalwell. “Is that right?”
“Yes.”
“So if Donald Trump lied to the Mueller investigators, which you agree would be a crime, then Roger Stone was in a position to expose Donald Trump’s lies. Are you familiar with a Dec. 3, 2018 tweet where Donald Trump said Roger Stone had shown ‘guts’ by not testifying against him?” asked Swalwell.
Barr said he didn’t know the quote and doesn’t read the president’s tweets, and Swalwell told him he would find a lot of “evidence” there. Unfortunately, this was a missed opportunity for Swalwell. He could have pointed out that the Mueller Report — which Barr supposedly read thoroughly enough to conclude Trump committed no crimes — pointed to exactly this tweet as evidence of the president’s potential crimes:
On November 28, 2018, eight days after the President submitted his written answers to the Special Counsel, the President criticized “flipping” and said that Stone was “very brave” for not cooperating with prosecutors. Five days later, on December 3, 2018, the President applauded Stone for having the “guts” not to testify against him. These statements, as well as those complimenting Stone and Manafort while disparaging Michael Cohen once Cohen chose to cooperate, support the inference that the President intended to communicate a message that witnesses could be rewarded for refusing to provide testimony adverse to the President and disparaged if they chose to cooperate.
Swalwell went on to note that “on July 10 of this year, Stone told a reporter: ‘I had 29 or 30 conversations with Trump during the campaign period. Trump knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him. It would have eased my situation considerably. But I didn’t. The prosecutors wanted me to play Judas. I refused.’ Are you familiar with that Stone statement?”
“Actually, I’m not,” said Barr.
“So how can you tell us, ‘Why should I investigate the president of the United States?’ When you’re not even aware of the facts concerning the president using the pardon or commutation power to swap the silence of a witness?”
“Because we require a reliable predicate before we open a criminal investigation,” Barr said.
Of course, there was a criminal investigation of this matter — the Mueller investigation, which had its own predicate. Now there’s just more proof of Trump’s corruption and potentially criminal abuse of power. Barr’s never explained his reasoning for why he declined to conclude Trump committed a crime, and he made clear in his testimony on Tuesday that he’s not even well-acquainted with some of the key evidence in question. The truth is, as I’ve argued, Barr is already committed to not investigating Trump, regardless of the evidence.

One of the House Democrats who questioned Barr was Rep. Ted Deutch of Pennsylvania, who demanded specifics about the attorney general’s involvement in the case.
Deutch noted that a DOJ “sentencing memo” on Barr “called for seven to nine years.” The Pennsylvania congressman told Barr, “It’s the policy of the U.S. attorney’s office to suggest a specific guideline range, which they did. And then, you overruled the line prosecutors and asked for a lower sentence — and you gave some reasons. You talked about health; health is considered only for an extraordinary physical impairment. Did that apply to Roger Stone?”
Barr responded that health can be a consideration in sentencing guidelines, but Deutch wanted to know how much of a factor health and age were with Stone specifically. And that’s when Deutsch’s questioning became especially biting. The congressman told Barr, “The issue here is whether Roger Stone was treated differently because he was friends with the president…. Can you think of any other cases where the defendant threatened to kill a witness, threatened the judge, lied to the judge — where the Department of Justice claimed that those were mere technicalities. Can you think of one?”
Barr was evasive, responding that “the judge agreed” with him — and Deutch doubled down on his questioning, telling Barr, “I’m not asking about the judge. I’m asking about what you did to reduce the sentence of Roger Stone.”
But Barr never really answered Deutch’s question. And before his questioning ended, Deutch told Barr, “The essence of the rule of law is that we have one rule for everybody.”

Martha McSally of Arizona promised voters that her campaign would “suspend all campaign fundraising” for the first two weeks of April in favor of “15 Days of Giving,” but finance records released last week show that the campaign seems to have raised $300,000 in that time, and apparently kept all of it.
“For the next 15 days, McSally for Senate will suspend all campaign fundraising and instead raise as much money as possible for The Salvation Army of Arizona,” the campaign claimed in an April 1 press release.
McSally also announced the plan in a video posted that day to Twitter: “I’m announcing today that my campaign will pause all fundraising for the next 15 days, as I launch a 15 Days of Giving campaign,” she said.
The campaign statement also said that McSally would “donate her entire Senate paycheck for the month of April to help people impacted by the coronavirus.” It’s unclear if she delivered on the promise.
In an April 2 interview McSally told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo that the campaign was “ceasing fundraising,” and shared a video of the interview to social media.
“I’m spending the next 15 days putting politics aside & raising money for the Salvation Army of Arizona. They’re providing rent assistance, household essentials & meals for kids & families. Make a donation today at //15daysofgiving.care. We’re in this together! #15DaysofGiving,” McSally tweeted.
The next day the Arizona Republic published a report, citing information from the campaign and an interview with the candidate: “Today, she’s not even asking for money. Instead, McSally is raising money for 15 days for The Salvation Army of Arizona.”
On April 11, McSally promoted a TV segment which suggested she had “stopped fundraising.”
The campaign also promoted a landing page designed to collect email information, which reads: “For the first 15 days of April, our campaign is committing 100% of our campaign resources to raising money for The Salvation Army’s COVID-19 relief efforts in Arizona.”
However, a Salon analysis of the campaign’s finance filings does not show that those funds went anywhere other than towards the campaign’s own account for future use. The donations came from large PACs and small-dollar individual contributors alike.
The McSally campaign did not reply to Salon’s request for comment.
McSally has found herself consistently underwater against Democratic opponent Mark Kelly, an astronaut and husband of former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was severely injured in a 2011 shooting. Kelly has held a double-digit margin over McSally for months, and recent polling puts the spread at around 12 points.
Last week the Cook Political Report shifted the race from “Toss Up” to “Lean” Democrat.
“The bottom fell out for us at the end of May and June,” a Republican strategist told the outlet.
Kelly has consistently outraised the Republican incumbent, more recently raising $12.8 million to McSally’s $8.9 million in the second quarter of this year.
A former Air Force combat pilot and two-term House member, McSally ran for an open U.S. Senate seat in Arizona in 2018, but was narrowly defeated by Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. Then McSally was appointed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey to fill Arizona’s other Senate seat, left vacant by the death of Sen. John McCain. She could end up losing two U.S. Senate races in the same state within two years, a rare accomplishment.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) on Tuesday went on a conspiratorial rant against former FBI officials who investigated President Donald Trump’s campaign for its contacts with Russian agents — and then got roundly mocked for sounding like a sentient “YouTube message board.”
At the start of the hearing, Jordan accused Democrats of attacking Barr for his attempts to uncovered purported “spying” on the Trump campaign by the Obama administration, and even accused former President Barack Obama of sending a “secret agent lady” to investigate former Trump campaign official George Papadopoulos.
Jordan’s rant earned him immediate scorn on Twitter — check out some reactions below.

“Yes or no: Have you discussed the president’s re-election campaign with the president, or with any White House official or surrogate of the president?” Chairman Nadler asked.
“Well I’m not going to get in to my discussions with the President,” Barr replied, refusing to answer.
“Have you discussed that topic with him? Yes or no?” Nadler pressed.
“Not in relation to the program,” Barr offered in a response that was illogical.
“I didn’t ask that – I asked if you discussed that –” Nadler said before Barr interrupted him.
“I’m a member of the Cabinet,” Barr declared indignantly. “There’s an election going on, obviously the topic comes up.”
There actually is no reason for a sitting president campaigning for re-election would discuss that campaign with an Attorney General. Barr also admitted the “topic comes up in cabinet meetings,” meaning Trump has discussed the campaign with other members of his Cabinet in the White House while conducting official government business.
Barr has sent federal “police” into various cities across the country, including Portland. These secret police forces have undermined the rule of law and enflamed what were mostly peaceful protests against police brutality and racial injustice.

But in fact, medical and security experts were sounding the alarm, including a group that has been dubbed the Red Dawn Team. And according to ABC News reporters Matthew Mosk, Kaitlyn Folmer and Josh Margolin, the e-mails the experts sent one another in January and February “now read like a chilling foreshadowing of the unfolding deadly pandemic.”
Their e-mail chain discussing COVID-19 started in January and was given the subject line “Red Dawn Rising,” which was a reference to “Red Dawn” — a Cold War-themed 1984 Hollywood action film in which a group of young Americans fought communist invaders. Members of the Red Dawn Team, according to the ABC News reporters, have “broken their silence about the early warnings” and their efforts to convince the Trump Administration that a major health crisis was unfolding.
Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, a public health officer in Seattle and King County, Washington who was part of that e-mail chain, told ABC News, “We did not step up and meet the challenge that we needed to meet. We didn’t act quickly enough to do the things that we needed to do early enough. And we still are not doing the things we need to do to get this outbreak under control.”
Although the New York Times first reported on the e-mail chain in April, members of the Red Dawn Team have — according to  Mosk, Folmer and Margolin — “tried to maintain a low profile.” But six of them agreed to speak to ABC News, including Dr. David Marcozzi, now with the University of Maryland Medical School.
Marcozzi told ABC News, “We were generally concerned that this was going to be a threat to our nation.” And Dr. Dan Hanfling, a biosecurity and disaster response expert who was also part of the Red Dawn Team, explained, “The president began to say (in March) that nobody could imagine that something like this could actually occur. The truth is that there was a group of us that had been trying to raise the alarm.”
In the e-mail string, the Red Dawn Team discussed, in depth, what was happening in Mainland China at the time — for example, Georgia Tech’s Eva Lee noted that a 20-year-old Wuhan woman was asymptomatic yet infected five members of her family with COVID-19. And Dr. Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the Trump Administration, saw what Lee wrote and responded, “Eva is this true?! If so, we have a huge (hole) on our screening and quarantine effort.”
Mosk, Folmer and Margolin note that “by February, members of the Red Dawn chain were solidifying their view that what started as a mystery illness in China was poised to become an epidemic of historic proportions” — and James Lawler, a former White House official under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama who was part of the chain, discussed his fears publicly.
According to the ABC News reporters, Lawler “shared his early projections during a speaking engagement at a reception for the American Hospital Association. When he began to rattle off the numbers, he recalled, the room grew uncomfortably silent. Without a clear and aggressive response, he said he expected 96 million Americans to contract COVID-19 and as many as 480,000 would die.”
Lawler told ABC News, “People were stunned…. They had not heard these types of projections before. The fact that folks were hearing these numbers for the first time from me was concerning.”

Not back in the sense of being a coronavirus treatment that is in any way recommended—it is definitely not—but back in right-wing media and on Donald Trump’s mind. The subject exploded on Monday when video of a Houston doctor insisting that hydroxychloroquine works and masks are unnecessary went hugely viral, backed by Breitbart News and Trump and Don Jr. In the hours before Facebook took the video down, it got more than 13 million views and seemingly kicked off a new string of tweets from Trump promoting the malaria drug, including repeated retweets of things then removed by Twitter.
To be clear, hydroxychloroquine’s FDA emergency use authorization—which was originally granted under pressure from Trump—is still revoked, and, in response to the new viral video, Dr. Anthony Fauci emphasized that “The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.” But the science is not good enough for, apparently, millions of people who would rather listen to Dr. Stella Immanuel.
Immanuel is a pediatrician with a history of bizarre and flatly ridiculous medical claims. “She has often claimed that gynecological problems like cysts and endometriosis are in fact caused by people having sex in their dreams with demons and witches,” The Daily Beast reports. “She alleges alien DNA is currently used in medical treatments, and that scientists are cooking up a vaccine to prevent people from being religious.” Oh, and the government is run in part by “reptilians.”
It’s in that context that you have to hear her claims, made Friday on Capitol Hill, that “Hello, you don’t need a mask. There is a cure” for COVID-19. Specifically, hydroxychloroquine. Immanuel claimed “I have treated over 350 patients with 100% success.”
Alien DNA, dream sex with demons and witches causing endometriosis, reptilian-led government, and hydroxychloroquine. Sounds about right.
The hydroxychloroquine good, masks bad claims are what Trump retweeted repeatedly, along with other promotion of hydroxychloroquine—14 tweets over the span of half an hour late Monday night. Hey, remember how last week Trump stayed on script for like 10 minutes and got widespread coverage of his “new tone” (ABC News) and “real change in tone” (CBS News) and “very different tone” (NBC News)? Yeah. And while I am not a fan of betting in general, if anyone wants to bet me that those media organizations learned their lesson and will in future refrain from claiming Trump has pivoted or changed his tone or the like, I will definitely bet that they have not learned that lesson.

0,2020-07-28T15:15:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trump-gets-a-lot-of-goodies-in-mcconnells-covid-19-relief-bill-and-the-american-people-get-shafted/,Trump gets a lot of goodies in McConnell’s COVID-19 ‘relief’ bill — and the American people get shafted,"While Republican senators were introducing their respective pieces of the new “coronavirus relief” bill Mitch McConnell has cooked up, called the HEALS Act (Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection, and Schools), Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer “to begin formal negotiations,” which really shows where the power to pass the new bill lies. Because what McConnell offered up is beyond ridiculous and doesn’t even have the support of probably half of his conference.
It has the support of absolutely no Democrats. Sen. Bernie Sanders summed up just how dead on arrival it is in a tweet detailing what’s in it: $2 billion for F-35s, $1.75 billion for an FBI building, $1 billion for surveillance planes, $375 million for armored vehicles, $360 million for missile defense, $283 million for Apache helicopters, and $0 for millions facing eviction. That sounds like a whole bunch of sweeteners McConnell had to throw in to get Trump appeased for not getting his payroll tax cut. The stuff in it that’s actually related to the COVID-19 crisis is really, really inadequate. It does one good, modest thing—the $1,200 direct payment is back, and here’s where they did the one good thing, children over age 17 will now be eligible for the $500 dependent payment. That’s pretty much the whole of the good.
In addition to the larding up of a public health bill with armaments and Trump bribes, it excludes increases in food assistance, rental assistance, student loan help, pretty much anything that helps. It does include a cut to the weekly unemployment insurance (UI) boost from $600 to $200 temporarily while states set up a system to pay people 70% of their previous income, which the Republicans want them to do in the next two months. State unemployment officials have united in opposition to that idea as completely unworkable. How bad is it? The Republican labor commissioner in Georgia, Mark Butler, calls it “the dumbest idea ever.” He says “We’re not the IRS. We don’t have your taxes. We don’t know what you made last year. Our stuff is based on you getting laid off by a particular employer and them reporting to us about what the wages are.” So there’s that.
That’s the sum total of how they plan to help people. They also include at least $100 billion more for the problematic Paycheck Protection Program. (Disclosure: Kos Media received a Paycheck Protection Program loan.) There is no new money for state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, just some tweaking of the restrictions on the previous $150 billion that was provided in the CARES Act so states have more flexibility. The only new money directed to states is for schools, a large portion of it restricted to go only to schools that physically reopen. It also has McConnell’s obsession, five-years of liability protection for businesses, healthcare providers, and others who might expose people to coronavirus infection.
The stuff, beyond military toys to make Trump happy, include an increase in business tax deductions for meals and entertainment. Presumably at Trump properties. Because so many people are now thinking, “you know, if I could just deduct the full cost of a meal it would be worth going to a restaurant and exposing myself to a potentially fatal virus.” That, it turns out, is why there’s also that new FBI building money included this bill. For years, Trump has been obsessing over a new headquarters to be built in downtown D.C. The problem isn’t the new building, everyone agrees the crumbling J. Edgar Hoover Building needs replacing. The pre-Trump plan was a suburban campus, which was nixed by Trump. That decision is still being investigated by the Justice Department’s inspector general because what seems to be behind Trump’s move is the fear that the feds selling off the spot where the current building is to a developer that would build a hotel on the site, one block from Trump’s D.C. hotel. Because everything is always going to be about the Trump grift.
This is a bad bill. It is an unacceptable bill for Democrats, which is one point of agreement with half of McConnell’s Republicans. They’re just coming from different angles on how bad it is. Democrats are rejecting it because it does basically nothing to help people and Republicans because it spends some money on people. “There is significant resistance to yet another trillion dollars,” said Sen. Ted Cruz “The answer to these challenges will not simply be shoveling cash out of Washington; the answer to these challenges will be getting people back to work.”
Democrats are starting from their HEROES Act, which includes much higher UI benefits’ hundreds of billions in state and local aid; hazard pay for essential workers; billions for the Postal Service; a 15% boost to food stamps; and $100 billion for renters as well as a moratorium on all evictions for the remainder of this year. For a start. This Republican bill, which has taken McConnell two and a half months to cobble together, after critical assistance deadlines have already passed, has been a phenomenal waste of time. Now the real work begins.

Liberal economist Paul Krugman, in his New York Times column, argues that the United States’ high number of coronavirus-related deaths and infections underscores the failures of President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. But Krugman also stresses that the problem goes way beyond Trump’s ineptness and exemplifies “America’s cult of selfishness.”
“Premature reopening led to a surge in infections: adjusted for population, Americans are currently dying from COVID-19 at around 15 times the rate in the European Union or Canada,” Krugman laments. “Yet the ‘rocket ship’ recovery Donald Trump promised has crashed and burned: job growth appears to have stalled or reversed, especially in states that were most aggressive about lifting social distancing mandates, and early indications are that the U.S. economy is lagging behind the economies of major European nations.”
Krugman notes that “Trump and allies were so eager to see big jobs numbers that they ignored both infection risks and the way a resurgent pandemic would undermine the economy.” But he goes on to say that “there’s a deeper explanation of the profoundly self-destructive behavior of Trump and his allies: they were all members of America’s cult of selfishness.”
The economist explains, “You see, the modern U.S. right is committed to the proposition that greed is good, that we’re all better off when individuals engage in the untrammeled pursuit of self-interest. In their vision, unrestricted profit maximization by businesses and unregulated consumer choice is the recipe for a good society.”
Republicans who are consumed with selfishness, according to Krugman, have a hard time looking at the big picture.
“I’ve long been struck by the intensity of right-wing anger against relatively trivial regulations, like bans on phosphates in detergent and efficiency standards for lightbulbs,” Krugman writes. “It’s the principle of the thing: many on the right are enraged at any suggestion that their actions should take other people’s welfare into account.”
According to Krugman, far-right Republicans equate irresponsibility with “freedom.”
“This rage is sometimes portrayed as love of freedom,” Krugman observes. “But people who insist on the right to pollute are notably unbothered by, say, federal agents teargassing peaceful protesters. What they call ‘freedom’ is actually absence of responsibility.”
Krugman concludes his column by warning that during the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans have “sacralized selfishness” with deadly results.
“What the coronavirus has revealed is the power of America’s cult of selfishness,” Krugman argues. “And this cult is killing us.”

Lee, a Yale forensic psychiatrist.  Both mark historic events: never has a family member with professional training come forth about the mental unfitness of a president, as never have thousands of mental health professionals come forth with their concerns about any president of any party, in U.S. history.   This week, Dr. Lee interviewed Dr. Ellyn Kaschak, one of the founders of the field of feminist psychology, a faculty member of San Jose State University in California, and editor of the Journal of Women and Therapy for over 20 years.  She wrote a chapter on women’s suffering under the current presidency for The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump.
Lee: I started these interviews because I was struck by the meager attention paid to Dr. Mary Trump’s expertise, which I found to be considerable and, as usual, the total absence of interviews of mental health experts on the president’s mental health.  What do you believe is the cause of this disregard for expertise, and do you believe her gender has something to do with it?
Kaschak: Yes, of course.  While she is clearly an expert, her gender renders her in the public mind as less of an authority and possibly even as having a score to settle because of well-documented attribution bias.
Donald is the kind of man plagued with inadequacy who hates and fears women who do not yield to his sense of superiority.
However, the media also play a role, as does the popular propensity to think rapidly and somewhat superficially in the Internet age, favoring superficial feeling over deep thought and analysis.  This is evidenced by the enormous number of copies of her book that were purchased so rapidly and enthusiastically, yet making little real impact so far.
Finally, while mental health has earned greater respect in recent years, there is still a great deal of American skepticism concerning expertise, fueled very much by the anti-intellectualism of the culture.  Donald Trump has been exposed but also well-protected and enabled by his co-conspirators, including Attorney General William Barr, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  I believe that the majority of the public is listening to us and watching event after event with dismay and exhaustion.  I believe they are listening to Mary Trump and to us, but looking to the election for the solution.
Given what Dr. Trump says about how Donald grew up, with his mother dealing mainly with the girls and his father with the boys, how do you explain Donald’s odd fixation on Ivanka?  In light of what we know about his view of women, is there an increased likelihood of abuse, intentional or not?
In my reworking of psychodynamics and psychotherapy from a feminist perspective, I have focused on Oedipus as the entitled father or king, and Antigone, his sister or daughter, as a mere extension of her father.  This remains the predominant relationship in patriarchal societies and clearly describes the relationship of the entitled Donald and his dutiful daughter.  In his eyes, she is merely an extension of his own glorious self, and he is entitled to her every service.  Antigone gave her eyes over to her father.  Other women have had to give over their bodies.  This entitlement includes making sexual comments about her and extends to sexual abuse, if he so chooses.
In his eyes, Ivanka is merely an extension of his own glorious self, and he is entitled to her every service.
There is not only an increased likelihood of abuse, but this is the paradigm for toxic masculinity, which includes a cultural entitlement to abuse women consciously and unconsciously.  The underlying belief is, “If I want it and am gratified by it, then so is she because my feelings are hers.”  Words like these are the most common defense of abusers.
Donald is clearly an abuser, as evidenced by his comments and treatment of women in public, his puerile bragging about what he can do to them because he is “famous,” his very public association with strippers, porn stars, and prostituted women, and his apparent close association with Jeffrey Epstein’s child trafficking enterprise.
Does Donald’s upbringing, as revealed in Dr. Trump’s book, explain his treatment of women whom he attacks or abruptly walks out on, calling women reporters “nasty”, for example, or refusing to shake hands with Angela Merkel of Germany, while engaging in prolonged handshakes with men, such as Emmanuel Macron of France?  Why do you believe he responds that way?
Donald is the kind of man plagued with inadequacy who hates and fears women who do not yield to his sense of superiority.  This includes women who are strong, courageous and do not yield to his empty narcissism and false entitlement.
This group of women includes Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton, and Nancy Pelosi and is also evidenced by the women who work for him that he can “own,” such as Kellyanne Conway, Betsy DeVos, and even Dr. Deborah Birx, whom I consider all to be abused women.  He has also expressed his disgust and disdain for women’s natural bodily functions such as menstruation.  He is emotionally and intellectually still that three-year-old taken from his mother.
Donald started attacking U.S. cities in the same week as her book, apparently in part to distract from it, which was a bombshell.  Ironically, by responding only to the latest flashy events, the media prevent us from keeping our eyes on the analysis and therefore the core issues that need addressing the most.  How can we remedy this situation?
This is perhaps the most difficult issue of all.  Clearly the media control and focus, or unfocus in this case, public attention and its greatly reduced attention span.  However, this is a symbiotic relationship in that the media base their work on the human propensity for the novel and exciting in order to make money and to compete.
As a result, any changes in the workings of the media have to involve a systemic change not based in capturing more eyes and, therefore, more bucks.  Concomitantly, this involves change in the habits of the public.
Needless to say, the system of choosing representatives of the population to focus deeply on governing issues, and to understand psychological dynamics well enough to change policy, has failed completely in the case of Donald Trump.

In the suspension notice that Surabian posted, Twitter told Trump Jr. that it had “temporarily limited some of your account features” and that he was being suspended for “violating the policy on spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.”

During an interview on her Fox Business program Mornings with Maria, Bartiromo berated Jarrett about whether Obama had directed the FBI to target then-candidate Donald Trump’s campaign.
Bartiromo preemptively dismissed Russia’s “meddling” in U.S. elections on behalf of Trump.
“That’s been going on for decades as you know,” the Fox News host said. “I’ve gone to Russia many times and have been watching this happen for decades. So we all know that Russia has been trying to meddle.”
“But now we’re talking about a very serious situation,” Bartiromo opined, steering the interview away from Russia. “We have a criminal investigation underway. People could go to jail. Do you believe if [former FBI Director] Jim Comey knew that the dossier was fake and garbage and he kept going, re-upping warrants to spy on the Trump campaign that he should go to jail?”
“I have a high degree of confidence in our intelligence community, investigators comported themselves responsibly,” Jarrett replied. “Look, Lindsey Graham is the one that encouraged Sen. McCain to turn over the dossier in the first place to the FBI.”
“But I do know that it’s nearly four years ago and I don’t understand why our focus isn’t on what’s happening right now and today,” she added. “That’s the investigation I’d like to see.”
Bartiromo interrupted loudly: “What’s happening right now is we are learning the details of what took place and we are getting official confirmation that the FBI knew that the dossier was garbage and made up in a bar because the sub-source of the dossier told FBI officials in early January.”
“I was not involved in any of those conversations,” Jarrett revealed. “But the question I really want to put to you is, what are we doing today? If people want to have an investigation about what happened four years ago, they should do that. But aren’t you concerned about what’s going on right now? Aren’t you worried about the integrity of our upcoming elections? Aren’t you worried about how we’re going to have a safe and fair election?”
“Yes!” Bartiromo exclaimed. “That’s why I’m asking you this question. Because I am a patriot and do not want to see people in positions of power put their finger on the scale and make up a story that there’s collusion with a foreign power when there’s absolutely no evidence of that.”
“I want to make sure we do not have the powers in government spying on political campaigns because the other political campaign paid for it,” the Fox News host continued. “We know that Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier… You’ve got one campaign paying for dirt on another campaign. And you’ve got the amazing intelligence agencies of our government weaponized.”
“You’re saying you knew nothing about it?” Bartiromo demanded to know. “You were President Obama’s right hand. And a lot of people wonder how much President Obama directed this.”
“That’s not how it works,” Jarrett shot back. “We leave that to the intelligence community to bring forward information. And the dossier, I would imagine, would be one piece of a much bigger puzzle.”
“The Mueller report didn’t concluded that there wasn’t any wrongdoing,” the former Obama adviser pointed out. “He was explicit in saying quite the opposite. You’re making statements that actually haven’t been proven.”

“According to the complaint, both Trump’s reelection campaign and a related fundraising group, the ‘Trump Make America Great Again Committee,’ are breaking federal campaign law by running payments through former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale’s private firms as well as American Made Media Consultants, a company created specifically to place ads and buy related services for the campaign,” reported S. V. Date.
“Parscale’s companies have already received $39 million from Trump’s campaign, the RNC and their joint fundraising committees, according to a HuffPost analysis of FEC filings from Jan. 20, 2017, through the end of June 2020. American Made Media Consultants has been paid $177.6 million from those same committees through that time period,” continued the report. “Among those payments: $180,000 a year each to Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and to Lara Trump, the wife of his second son, Eric Trump.”
Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director, denied this arrangement is illegal, saying, “AMMC is a campaign vendor responsible for arranging and executing media buys and related services at fair market value.” But CLC attorney Brendan Fischer disagrees, saying, “The money is being laundered through corporations run by top Trump campaign officials … this scheme violated the law and undermines the public’s right to know. What precisely is being hidden is unknown. We don’t know for sure.”
Questions have swirled around the Trump family’s use of political money ever since the president took office, with a recent criminal investigation focusing on how cash flowed from the Trump inauguration committee to businesses held by the Trump Organization.

0,2020-07-28T14:03:26+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/gop-insiders-fear-trumps-maga-base-isnt-as-solid-as-he-thinks-report/,GOP insiders fear Trump’s MAGA base isn’t as solid as he thinks: report,"If President Donald Trump is reelected in 2020, it won’t be because of California, Massachusetts, New York State or Oregon. Rather, Trump will need a heavy turnout in red states as well as in the more GOP-friendly parts of swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Arizona and Florida, which is why he has been running a far-right campaign and making a concerted effort to rally his MAGA base as much as possible. But journalists Sam Stein and Asawin Suebsaeng, in an article published in the Daily Beast on July 27, address Republican fears that the president’s base might not be as solid as they would like it to be.
“With fewer than 100 days to go until Election Day,” Stein and Suebsaeng explain, “President Donald Trump and his chief political advisers are barely lifting a finger to expand his coalition of potential voters. Instead, they are desperately attempting to turn out Republicans, prevent his base from fracturing, and ward off conservative defections that would seal his fate as a self-described one-term ‘loser.’ It’s an election strategy that has left others in the Republican Party equal parts perplexed and paralyzed — fearful of the president’s wrath, but also, confused about why he isn’t making any sustained effort to expand his electoral coalition.”
In a July 26 tweet, Trump bashed the Reagan Foundation, former House Speaker Paul Ryan and Fox News for not being right-wing enough. And a Republican strategist, presumably interviewed on condition of anonymity, cited that tweet as a perfect example of why Trump’s rally-the-base approach is problematic — telling the Beast, “I thought, ‘Damn, he jammed a lot in there in one broadside.’ The base is the piece he can control the most, but there are times where he sees his base as a larger portion of the Republican voting bloc than it is. There are a lot of gettable Republicans outside of the cultural issues that he plays on.”
So the Washington Post is running the Reagan Foundation, and RINO Paul Ryan is on the Board of Fox, which has been terrible. We will win anyway, even with the phony @FoxNews suppression polls (which have been seriously wrong for 5 years)! https://t.co/fOi3AROxuz
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2020
Stein and Suebsaeng report that “within the upper echelons of Trumpworld,” there is a “broader anxiety…. that the president’s conservative base — which Trump and the party have long touted as rock-solid and fiercely loyal — may be starting to rupture amid the coronavirus pandemic, a weakened U.S. economy and protest movements in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. It is a concern that some close associates of the president have raised to him directly.”
A Republican insider, quoted anonymously, explained to the Beast, “I told (Trump) that he should believe the polling, and that it shows that the way things are going, some of his base may abandon him by the election. That is what the numbers are saying.” GOP strategist Barry Bennett, who was among Trump’s advisers for his 2016 campaign, believes that the president should be talking about the economy more.
Bennett told the Beast, “The president has tremendous power in what to talk about, and he has kind of gotten off-track in talking about what the media wants him to talk about. He should be tweeting pictures of people going back to work…. Let’s see some pictures of those people…. The media is not gonna help him tell the good news. He’s gotta do it himself, and he should use his platform for that.”
In June, the United States’ unemployment rate — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — was 11.1% compared to 13.3% in May or 14.4% in April. In other words, the U.S. still had double-digit unemployment last month.
Bennett also told the Beast, “I’m not sure there are many undecided people in this country. So, it’s more a question of tending to your base and turning them out. I get why he doesn’t like the Fox polling. But tweeting about that isn’t going to get you any votes.”

Following the jackbooted nincompoopery of the Trump White House, as I’ve said multiple times before, is a lot like leaning too far back in our chairs and almost falling over backward — but catching ourselves at the last minute. Every day brings with it new devilry violently propelled from Trump’s twisted tennis-ball machine of awfulness, keeping the entire nation perpetually off balance.
Trump’s lack of personal restraint, combined with his complete inability to understand or respect democratic institutions, along with his obvious sociopathy and admiration for overseas villains like Vladimir Putin and Rodrigo Duterte, were always destined to fuse at the cellular level in harrowing ways, especially if he were tested by a national or global calamity.
And here we are. In the past several weeks, as the coronavirus death toll draws close to 150,000 while demonstrators take to the streets, the other shoe has officially dropped, exposing Donald Trump as the first American fascist to occupy the White House. I don’t write this lightly or colloquially: Trump is our first fascist president, and the people who continue to enable him, be they his staff or his accomplices at OAN or Fox News or on Capitol Hill, ought to be viewed as sympathizers to his version of strongman ultranationalism.
Trump’s policies have always been racing at ludicrous speed toward American fascism, and now, during the most horrendous global crisis since World War II, he’s fully embracing the worst-case scenario — the thing many of us have warned about since 2016.
The age of American fascism has arrived. The dangers are immeasurable.
As soon as Trump chose to unleash federal stormtroopers in reaction to protesters, deploying an army of faceless thugs into American cities armed with allegedly non-lethal weapons, the Rubicon was crossed. There’s no going back until, at the very least, Trump is ousted from power and held accountable for the unconstitutional horror show he’s manifested. We’ll circle back to this.
Fascism, derived from Benito Mussolini’s political stranglehold on Italy, generally possesses the characteristics of hyper-nationalism, opposition to socialism and communism, suppression of dissent, an ideology of racial supremacy and the vilification of “the other” — foreigners, minorities and other groups, often rounded up and virtually disappeared into government internment camps.
Trump’s entire campaign for president began with the demonization of Latino immigrants and, after his inauguration, segued into mass incarceration of entire families, including infants and small children, with myriad reports of sexual assault against both adult women and underage girls. He routinely frames moderate Democrats like Joe Biden as full-blown commies. He’s labeled the American news media as enemies of the people. And no one would argue that he expresses obvious, if dunderheaded, ultranationalism.
Now, on top of all that, he’s turning ICE and other paramilitary forces against American citizens. At his command, activists are being assaulted, injured and disappeared for the ffenseo of exercising their First Amendment free speech and assembly rights. Whatever acts of petty vandalism may be taking place, Trump has publicly described the “walls” of moms and veterans, along with other groups, as “lamestream media” scams, offering up more propagandized excuses for assaulting constitutional liberties.
There wasn’t any graffiti being sprayed nor statues being toppled when Trump and Bill Barr ordered their foot soldiers to tear-gas the crowd at Lafayette Park on June 1, so the president could stage his awkward photo-op holding a Bible he’s never read. Incidentally, the following maxim has been playing on an endless loop in my head: “When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross,” and I’d wager I’m not alone. Fascism is here and it looks exactly like that — flanked by Lee Greenwood anthems and bogus religious imagery.
It doesn’t matter how much graffiti is sprayed or how many Confederate statues fall, the federal government was never intended to exercise police powers inside our borders. Yet the party of alleged “small government” is ignoring all that. In the past, many of our most conservative 10th Amendment scholars have noted that police power is reserved for the states. (For instance: Read this, from the libertarian Cato Institute’s “Handbook for Congress.”) And yet every day, new videos emerge of Trump’s stormtroopers brutalizing unarmed Americans, be they 14-year-old girls, Navy veterans or women daring to brandish flowers. Indeed, Republicans have abandoned their claim to states’ rights and libertarianism. No more. Not when their fascist messiah is ordering children beaten by his shock troops. The Republican Party, like Trump, is utterly devoid of core values now, lost forever in a cloud of pepper spray and throat-constricting gas.
Jason Stanley, author of “How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them,” said in a recent interview that Trump isn’t intrinsically fascist — instead, he’s “performing fascism,” which is almost as terrible. Trump, as many have noted, doesn’t possess any core values, be they fascist or miscellaneous. That said, he certainly possesses a lizard-brain fight-or-flight instinct and knows how to co-opt behaviors to suit his ass-saving agenda. Whether his actions reflect his personal sense of right and wrong doesn’t really matter. The overall effect is that of a fascist dictator beating the opposition into submission while suppressing critical speech. And like good fascist enablers, his Red Hat loyalists are cheering it along.
Of course Trump’s fanboys are unwaveringly supporting the fascism of their Mad King, keeping his polling approval averages in the low 40s, even as he invades and indefinitely occupies what he considers to be opposition strongholds — the cities of the “Radical Left.” There’s no exit strategy and in fact Trump has publicly threatened to send in more goon squads to accompany his Nixon-derived “law and order” campaign plank. (By the way, Trump also stole “Make America great again” from Ronald Reagan. He steals a lot, including taxpayer money — an idea he stole from Putin, his kleptocratic paymaster.)
The clear ascendancy of fascism inside the White House is unprecedented and therefore the response must be equally without precedent. If Trump is ousted in November — and he must be ousted — he and his sympathizers must face the legal consequences of their actions so that it never happens again. Not here. There must be ramifications for what they’ve done to our country.
Naturally, the Red Hat entertainment complex will scream and whine and play the victim like always. So what. Fascism, in whatever form, has to be crushed before it crushes us. On the other hand, a second Trump term will fully metastasize it, ending our democratic republic as we know it. Put it this way: If we do our jobs as citizens of a free republic, Trump and his co-conspirators will have to start thinking about late-night escape routes to non-extradition nations. And the sooner we recognize the true nature of what’s happening right now in America, the sooner the perpetrators will face commensurate repercussions.

That year, Trump won non-college-educated white voters by 39 points, and there’s evidence to suggest that turnout among that group was higher than in prior elections — but now there’s growing evidence those same voters have had enough of him, reported Politico.
“Don’t get me wrong, he’s done some good stuff, but lately he’s just been ticking me off,” said Kathy Manuel, a Scranton voter who backed Barack Obama twice and now regrets her Trump vote in 2016.
“He’s not taking the virus serious enough,” she added. “He keeps saying it’ll go away, and that’s not true. We need someone to fix this country right now, because it’s a mess. I don’t really like [Joe] Biden, either. I don’t like how extreme the Democrats are with abortion nowadays. But he’s been around a long time, he seems to know the system, so maybe he can get things back on track. I don’t know. This country is out of whack, and Trump doesn’t seem to care. I’m getting sick of him, you know?”
Other Scranton voters told similar tales.
“You know, whether you liked George W. Bush or Barack Obama, at least they had morals, at least they were good people,” said Joe Barbuti, a 43-year-old who sat out the last presidential election. “I took that for granted back then, and I won’t ever take it for granted again. Trump is not a good person, and I think Biden is going to win because of that.”
Barbuti “definitely” plans to vote against Trump in November’s election.
“I’m not a big Biden guy,” he said. “Not at all, actually. But it’s time for a change. Trump has divided the country. It’s time to give someone else a chance. That’s how a lot of people seem to be thinking around here. A lot of people in this area who didn’t vote, are going to vote for Biden, and I actually think a lot of Democrats who switched to Trump, are going to go back to voting Democrat this time.”
Dave Sherman, a 75-year-old who voted for Clinton in 2016, is counting the days until he can vote against Trump again.
“Yeah, but it’s Trump who got us here,” Sherman said. “He said he was going to Make America Great Again. Now look at us! We’re going down the sh*tter, and he’s the one flushing.”

0,2020-07-28T13:34:00+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/kayleigh-mcenany-received-payroll-checks-from-trump-campaign-while-working-at-the-white-house-thats-not-legal/,Kayleigh McEnany received payroll checks from Trump campaign while working at the White House. That’s not legal,"White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany received $12,000 in payroll payments from the Trump campaign after her official appointment to a position in the Trump administration, as federal election filings examined by Salon show. That would be a clear ethical breach, and could indicate violations of the laws governing campaign finance and payments to political appointees.
The campaign reported the payments on April 16 and May 1, in the amount of McEnany’s regular $6,000 biweekly salary, and filed the disbursements as “payroll” expenses. Another filing, viewable here, shows the campaign reimbursed McEnany for $524.57 in travel expenses on May 26.
Prior to joining the administration, McEnany served as spokeswoman for the Trump campaign. The White House released a statement officially naming McEnany as its press secretary on April 8. Though she did not give her first official briefing until May 1, she had already released official statements and spoken on behalf of the White House in media interviews. McEnany confirmed to Salon in a phone interview that April 13 was her official start date at the White House.
“The campaign overpaid me, and I immediately paid them back,” McEnany said, claiming that “every penny has been paid back in the overlap.”
Trump’s press secretary added that the reimbursement was for “travel for a rally” when she “had been unable to get a bill from the Hilton, which they provided many months after because of COVID timing.”
McEnany did not provide evidence of this, or point Salon to any government or campaign records that could substantiate her claims. Following the call with McEnany, a White House press officer sent Salon an off-the-record email. When Salon requested further information on the record. McEnany then emailed a statement about what she characterized as a “mistaken payment.”
I learned of the campaign’s mistaken payment on May 2nd, and I immediately contacted Trump Campaign CFO Sean Dollman to notify him of the error. The campaign’s mistaken payment has been paid back to ensure there was no overlapping payment beyond my April 13th start date at the White House.
Salon asked McEnany to provide evidence to support her claims, but did not receive an answer. Neither McEnany, the Trump campaign nor the White House has yet provided evidence that she “immediately” repaid the campaign.
When shown the filing, a senior FEC official directed Salon’s questions to the campaign.
Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh told Salon in a phone call that he would only begin to discuss the payments in an off-the-record conversation. Salon did not agree to this and Murtaugh later emailed the following statement:
There was a clerical error in the recording of Kayleigh McEnany’s termination date when she left the campaign and as a result continued being paid by our payroll provider. Kayleigh immediately notified the campaign of the error. She has reimbursed the payroll company for the full amount she was mistakenly paid. Kayleigh handled everything properly.
The campaign did not provide any evidence of this repayment. FEC records show the payment came to McEnany directly from the Trump campaign, not from a payroll company. Neither Salon nor campaign finance experts could find evidence of any reimbursement in FEC filings.
“If she really gave the money back so quickly in May, before the FEC report was filed in June, the campaign probably never would have reported that payment in the first place,” said Kedric Payne, general counsel and senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, in a phone interview.
“But if she did pay the campaign back, and they did report it like they’re required to do, then that reimbursement should be in the FEC filings,” Payne continued. “I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt to explain where it is, or show it later if there was some filing mistake, but it’s not clear from what I see in the campaign’s filings that there was any reimbursement received for these payments.”
“Campaign funds are meant for bona fide campaign expenditures,” Ciarra Torres-Spelliscy, campaign finance law expert at Stetson University and former fellow at Brennan Center for Justice, told Salon.
“There are, however, laws about federal employees which limit outside income,” she added, citing 18 U.S.C. § 209 — “Salary of Government officials and employees payable only by United States” —which reads:
Salary of Government officials and employees payable only by the United States prohibits employees from being paid by someone other than the United States for doing their official Government duties. For example, a highly paid executive of a corporation, upon entering Government service, could not accept an offer from her former employer to make up the difference between her Government salary and the compensation she received from her former employer.
That law makes an exception for “special government employees,” as well as “employees serving without compensation.” Such examples include former ambassador Kurt Volker, who served the Trump administration as an unpaid “special envoy” to Ukraine while drawing his full salary as an executive at the lobbying firm BGR.
McEnany has never said she was working for the White House for free.
“Since these are officially ‘payroll’ payments, and not individually itemized services, it appears she was a salaried employee while also working in her official administration capacity,” Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel for the government watchdog CREW, told Salon. “If she was on salary while also drawing White House pay, then she might be subject to criminal statutes and other conflicts of interests, such as unlawfully supplementing government income.”
Jerry Goldfeder, an election and campaign finance expert at Stroock LLP, was blunt.
“Not permissible,” he told Salon. “A federal employee cannot simultaneously be an employee or consultant of a campaign.”
“18 U.S.C. Section 209 says you can’t pay somebody from a third party to do government services,” added Payne of the Campaign Legal Center. “But there’s also a section in the Code of Federal Regulations barring payments to political appointees.”
That code points to Executive Order 12674, which reads in part: “No employee who is appointed by the President to a full-time noncareer position in the executive branch … shall receive any earned income for any outside employment or activity performed during that Presidential appointment.”
“The White House and the campaign need to provide evidence to explain what was going on here, and we need accountability if there was a conflict,” Payne said. “But I don’t at all put it beyond this White House to try to talk itself out of this.”
Canter also expressed concern.
“It would be much cleaner not to be joining the White House from an active campaign with monies owed by the campaign to a White House employee,” she said.
All three of McEnany’s overlapping campaign payments were addressed to her at 725 Fifth Avenue in New York — the address of Trump Tower.
McEnany has apparently never lived at Trump Tower or listed it as an address, but the Trump campaign lists the building as one of its “headquarters” and reportedly keeps a skeleton staff there to justify paying an exorbitant rent. Ryann McEnany, Kayleigh’s sister, also has her $2,538 biweekly campaign payments addressed to Trump Tower.
In 2018, McEnany’s driver’s license and car registration listed a residential address in Edgewater, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan. She cast a mail-in absentee ballot in Florida that year, which might have been a violation of election law.

He was one-hundred-percent lying.
Well, maybe 95 percent.
Trump apparently had been asked years prior, as in, “You should come and do that some day,” what some would call an open invitation. There had not been a formal invitation, no date set, and until he made that announcement, the Yankees had neither been asked nor told.
But he did it, The New York Times reports, because he was jealous of Dr. Fauci.
“Randy Levine is a great friend of mine from the Yankees,” Trump told reporters on Thursday, just one hour before Fauci threw the first ball. “And he asked me to throw out the first pitch, and I think I’m doing that on August 15 at Yankee Stadium.”
“There was one problem,” the Times explains. “Mr. Trump had not actually been invited on that day by the Yankees, according to one person with knowledge of Mr. Trump’s schedule. His announcement surprised both Yankees officials and the White House staff.”
Trump “had been so annoyed by Dr. Fauci’s turn in the limelight, an official familiar with his reaction said, that he had directed his aides to call Yankees officials and make good on a longtime standing offer from Mr. Levine to throw out an opening pitch.”
On Sunday, for reasons unknown, Trump “canceled,” so to speak, making a big deal out of his “change” of plans.
Because of my strong focus on the China Virus, including scheduled meetings on Vaccines, our economy and much else, I won’t be able to be in New York to throw out the opening pitch for the @Yankees on August 15th. We will make it later in the season!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2020
Perhaps he canceled after remembering last year’s World Series:
<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>
Regardless, his tweet “canceling” was quickly panned by many on social media, who could tell he had been lying from the start.

0,2020-07-28T12:25:09+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/senate-hopeful-kris-kobach-bankrolled-by-billionaire-peter-thiel-says-coronavirus-numbers-are-being-cooked-to-hurt-trump/,Senate hopeful Kris Kobach — bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel — says coronavirus numbers are ‘being cooked’ to hurt Trump,"With Republicans in fear of losing the U.S. Senate in November, the last thing they need is for far-right extremist Kris Kobach to win the state’s GOP senatorial primary this summer and put the seat in play for Democrats. And Kobach’s recent comments on COVID-19 are a prime example of why Democrats believe they could defeat him in the general election: Kobach is claiming that the coronavirus death count is being exaggerated as part of a conspiracy to hurt President Donald Trump. Regardless, Kansas’ former secretary of state continues to pursue the nomination, and he has a major ally in tech billionaire and venture capitalist Peter Thiel.
On the YouTube program “National File,” Kobach said of the pandemic, “I believe that the numbers are being cooked.”
According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 654,300 people worldwide and over 148,000 in the United States. Truth be told, that 148,000+ figure is probably too low — as the death count in the U.S. focuses on hospital deaths and doesn’t take into account all of the Americans who have died from COVID-19 in their homes and were never hospitalized. But Kobach nonetheless insists that the pandemic isn’t as deadly as Trump’s critics are making it out to be.
On the July 13 edition of K-File, Kobach claimed, “The books are being cooked, and the purpose, at least on the political left, is to use those numbers to scare the public and to scare the political leadership into shutting down. Now, they want to continue the government shutdown for — the business shutdown — with government pressure, for as long as they can. If they can slow it down by using masks as a signal that things are not back to normal — and therefore, you should not go out, you should not buy, you shouldn’t open up your business yet — whatever, but the reason is obvious.”
Such claims are a prime example of why Democrats believe they could defeat Kobach if he wins the Republican senatorial primary in Kansas and makes it to the general election — especially in light of the fact that Democrats defeated him once before. In Kansas’ gubernatorial election in 2018, Kobach (who served as chairman of the Kansas Republican Party from 2007-2009 and as Kansas’ secretary of state from 2011-2019) lost to a Democrat: centrist Laura Kelly, now Kansas’ governor. And as deep red as Kansas is, Kobach’s defeat in 2018 demonstrated that a Democrat can win a statewide race in that state if the GOP nominee is extreme enough.
But as extreme as Kobach is, he has found a major ally in Thiel. According to Vox’s Theodore Schleifer, Thiel held a fundraiser for the Republican in Manhattan and has since “pumped $850,000 into a super PAC behind Kobach.”
Schleifer reports, “If Kobach is elected, it could give Thiel a loyal ally in the Senate because of how powerful he is proving to be in the race. That alliance becomes all the more key if Trump loses this fall, which would weaken the Washington influence of Thiel — a board member at Facebook and a founder of Palantir, which has deep ties to the government.”
Patrick Miller, who teaches political science at the University of Kansas, believes that Thiel has become indispensable to Kobach’s Senate campaign. Miller told Vox, “I don’t want to overstate it and say that Kobach wouldn’t have a campaign without him. But I think the money that that super PAC is putting into the race — primarily through this one rich guy — is absolutely the lifeblood of the pro-Kobach campaign at this moment. You take that money away, and Kobach doesn’t have a lot of campaign left.”
Kobach is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who is retiring. In the primary, he is up against Rep. Roger Marshall — and the GOP strategists who fear that Kobach, if nominated, would lose to a Democrat are rallying around Marshall aggressively and hoping to God he becomes the nominee. Scott Reed, a political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told Politico, “A Kobach victory would definitely put the Republican majority in jeopardy because it would add another state that would need serious resources.”
According to Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is hoping that Kobach becomes the nominee because he believes that Kobach would be easier to defeat than Marshall. Law told Politico, “The latest ad from Schumer’s Kansas pop-up PAC shows that they want to start the general election early by going after Marshall, and we aren’t going to let them get the jump on us.”

While giving short shrift to workers, the Republican package would ensure that corporations are not held accountable for putting their employees in danger by providing a sweeping five-year liability shield geared toward protecting businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits—a top priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The GOP plan also includes billions of dollars in funds that are completely unrelated to fighting the coronavirus pandemic, such as $686 million for F-35 fighter jets and $1.75 billion for construction of a new FBI headquarters. McConnell apparently had no idea funding for the FBI building was included in the final legislation, which was crafted in his office.
“Um, I’m not sure that it is. Is it?” McConnell said during a press conference when asked why the FBI funds are in the bill.
Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen, said late Monday that “McConnell’s proposal—negotiated without any input from Democrats in the U.S. House or Senate—is dead on arrival.”
“Senate Republicans have wasted months coming up with a proposal that, remarkably, would make the pandemic and economic pain even worse—especially a corporate immunity provision that would be a literal death sentence to countless Americans,” Gilbert added. “It’s long past time for the real negotiations to begin.”
On Twitter, Public Citizen denounced the the GOP plan as “an utter disgrace,” noting that it wouldn’t extend a federal eviction moratorium that expired last Friday or provide a penny in election assistance funding for states.
Titled the Health, Economic Assistance, Liability, and Schools (HEALS) Act, the $1 trillion opening bid from Republicans was released in bits and pieces Monday as coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to surge across the U.S. and the economy remains in deep recession, with the official unemployment rate hovering above 11%.
The Republican plan would temporarily reduce the weekly unemployment insurance boost from $600 to $200 until states can implement a complicated—some say unworkable—new system that would pay laid-off workers 70% of what they earned prior to losing their jobs. Additionally, the GOP proposal would provide another round of $1,200 direct stimulus payments to most Americans, funding for U.S. schools that meet “minimum opening requirements,” and $16 billion for coronavirus testing.
Tucked inside the Republican stimulus package is also a bill led by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) that could result in deep cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
If Romney really cared about strengthening Social Security he’d support @RepJohnLarson‘s Social Security 2100 Act.
But that bill would require wealthy people like Romney to pay their fair share. So he wants to use the TRUST Act to cut benefits behind closed doors instead. https://t.co/bmZuzBuuzT
— SocialSecurityWorks (@SSWorks) July 27, 2020
In a joint statement late Monday, the American Federation of Teachers, Care in Action, Community Change Action, Greenpeace, and MoveOn warned that if passed, the Republican proposal “would devastate America.”
“Americans should be outraged at Senate Republicans and the Trump administration for wasting months and, at the 11th hour, offering a proposal so weak that it would only guarantee our country’s backslide into the Covid-19 crisis,” the groups said. “The plan put forth by Majority Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans is a non-starter that will do nothing for workers and families, and keep the United States on this devastating path.”
Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy Action, slammed the Senate GOP for “coming to the table with a package that prioritizes protecting corporations from lawsuits.”
“Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer, and all Congressional Democrats, must reject this plan outright and fight for a package that meets the scale of the crisis,” said Archila, who urged Democrats to fight to extend the $600-per-week unemployment insurance boost, pass a paycheck guarantee, provide adequate hazard pay and PPE for frontline workers, and ensure that Covid-19 testing and treatment is free for everyone in the U.S.
“Anything less,” warned Archila, “will only prolong the health and economic crisis, and exacerbate suffering in every corner of this country.”

0,2020-07-28T11:20:19+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/democrats-are-fielding-candidates-in-almost-every-house-race-this-year/,Democrats are fielding candidates in almost every House race this year,"The last filing deadline for major-party candidates anywhere in the country passed on Friday when Louisiana, which always bring up the caboose, closed its books.
Candidates often enter races late in the Pelican State, and Democrats received a welcome surprise a couple of days before the deadline when Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins announced a bid against Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, giving the party a credible contender where before it had none.
There were no unexpected developments in the state’s lone open House seat in the 5th Congressional District, where Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham decided to retire after an unsuccessful bid for governor last year. The best-funded candidate by a wide margin is Luke Letlow, a former Abraham chief of staff who has his old boss’ endorsement, but two other notable Republicans are running: state Rep. Lance Harris and Ouachita Parish police juror Scotty Robinson. (In Louisiana, a parish police jury is similar to a county commission or board of supervisors.)
This dark-red district in the state’s northeast is sure to stay in the GOP’s hands, but there’s a chance the race won’t get resolved until a Dec. 5 runoff in the event that no one takes a majority in November. Challengers, meanwhile, filed to run against incumbents in every other Louisiana House seat, all of which are held by Republicans except the 2nd, which is represented by Democrat Cedric Richmond. Thanks to a GOP-drawn gerrymander, none of these districts will be competitive in the fall.
While some states will still allow independents to qualify for the general election, the roster of major candidates is now set. Both parties have left comparatively few seats uncontested. Republicans will not field anyone in 19 races, which is their lowest total since 2010, when they didn’t contest just five seats and retook the House. Democrats, meanwhile, have failed to put up candidates in only eight districts, which follows on the extremely low three seats they left unchallenged last cycle—the fewest since the post-Watergate election of 1974, when the party tied its modern record by leaving only Ohio Rep. Charles Whalen without an opponent.
As you can see from our list of all 25 uncontested seats—which is reflected in the map at the top of this post—virtually all are in territory that is safe for one party or the other. There is one exception, though: Republican Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart is guaranteed a 10th term in Florida’s 26th District, which Donald Trump carried by just a 50-48 margin four years ago. However, this area still often votes for Republicans downballot, and Díaz-Balart beat a credible challenger in 2018 60-40, despite the blue wave.
One final note: The number of districts without a Republican on the November ballot could tick up a bit after next week’s primaries in Washington state. That’s because Washington, like California, uses a top-two system, where all candidates from all parties run together in the primary, and the top two vote-getters regardless of party advance to the general election. That’s already the case in half a dozen dark blue California districts this year, and it could happen again in the Evergreen State, mostly likely in the open 10th District.

That it was being laughed at. That other nations considered our country “weak.”
Three hundred years and one utterly failed pandemic response into Trump’s administration, the world really is laughing at us. Polls show that 64% of people around the world have “no confidence” in Trump as U.S. leader, and even that is being held down by Trump’s approval ratings among worldwide fascists. We are absolutely seen as “weak”—and rightly so.
The Washington Post’s latest write-up notes a variety of factors, all of them well-known at this point. The U.S. response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been absolutely catastrophic—an incompetent farce blending fascist administration assurances that all is well with a complete inability to manage preparedness, testing, contact tracing, or any unified policies at all. Other nations are returning to normal as rigorous case tracking keeps local outbreaks small and contained; here, caseloads have skyrocketed. Policies remain little different from those in March, or April.
On the foreign policy front, there is none. Trump has no foreign policy other than grift. He insults friendly world leaders as an uncontrollable personality trait. He waffles back and forth on military matters and alliances according to whatever he has last seen on television or who he has last spoken to, betraying Kurdish allies in Syria as result of a single conversation, threatening South Korea and other nations with the withdrawal of U.S. troops if they do not pony up cash on his say-so, and being contemptuous of female women leaders for no reason other than his own obsessive misogyny.
There is likewise no diplomacy in the Trump era, as in none at all; the State Department and its secretary have zero power to negotiate anything that the incompetent leader will not himself reverse days later. It is a paper tiger. The United States cannot argue itself a champion of democracy because we are plainly not; the administration doesn’t give a flying damn about human rights, and the world has ample quotes to prove it.
The Department of Justice is brazenly corrupt. Any notion of U.S. leadership when it comes to either the treatment of journalists or the apolitical application of law is a joke.
It’s not even remotely surprising that citizens in other nations are looking at this orange buffoon and his inept, flailing minions and deeming the United States flighty and unreliable. Most people in the world are not pathological about these things. You can’t put a leader on the world stage and have him publicly fail at everything, finally culminating in the very public botching of a worldwide pandemic that most large non-authoritarian nations have brought under at least tenuous control, and have nobody notice.
Other nations don’t have Fox News, for starters. They don’t have that steady stream of public propaganda propping Trump up.
The Post also notes that as the world loses confidence in the United States as a reliable (or even moderately sane) international partner, China is benefiting the most. That’s also to be expected; dealing with China has some harsh conditions of its own, but nations needing aid can be relatively sure the conditions will not change from week to week based on a malignant narcissist’s television habits.
The real question is how lasting this damage will be. Hollowing out the State Department will take time to repair, but even the most competent new administration will of necessity be changing United States foreign policies back to what they were before all this [string of unprintable expletives] happened, and there’s no credible way for any future administration to assure allies things will not go immediately down the tubes again, a few more years down the line.

0,2020-07-28T11:03:32+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/a-new-poll-finds-joe-biden-ahead-in-a-district-trump-won-by-15-points-four-years-ago/,A new poll finds Joe Biden ahead in a district Trump won by 15 points four years ago,"To showcase just how extensively Trump’s decline has shifted the playing field, the DCCC shared with the Washington Post details of an in-house poll it conducted of Texas’ deep-red 25th Congressional District that finds Joe Biden edging Donald Trump 47-46 and puts Republican Rep. Roger Williams up just 45-43 on his Democratic challenger, attorney Julie Oliver.
That’s a huge shift from 2016, when Williams’ district went for Trump by a wide 55-40 margin. And that’s exactly what Republicans intended: The 25th is part of a careful gerrymander that cracked the Austin area six ways and allowed the GOP to win five of those seats. One of those is Williams’ district, which stretches far to the north toward Dallas-Forth Worth, combining a slice of the state capital with rural regions well outside of it.
As a result, the 25th is more rural (and whiter) than most of the suburban seats in Texas that are at the top of Democrats’ target list. As DCCC executive director Lucinda Guinn put it, the district had only been “maybe on the outer edges of our battlefield,” but that may now change. In 2018, Sen. Ted Cruz only carried this seat 52-47 over Beto O’Rourke, so it’s plausible that the leftward march here is continuing.
The biggest difficulty for Oliver, though, may be getting her name out: She had just $90,000 in her campaign account as of June 30, versus $1.3 million for Williams. If the DCCC’s poll is accurate, Oliver’s been buoyed by the rising tide that has lifted so many Democrats, but to get past the incumbent, she’ll need the resources to effectively communicate with voters.

Susan Collins still hasn’t said whether she voted for Donald Trump in her state’s presidential primary in March, or if she’ll endorse him this fall. She has a novel excuse: “I am concentrating on my own campaign and I am not going to get involved in presidential politics. I’m going to concentrate on my own race.” She’s not going to reiterate her adamant 2016 opposition to Trump, detailed in an op-ed during that election. She could do that then, she says, because “I wasn’t on the ballot, I wasn’t up for reelection. I didn’t have my own race to worry about at that point.” How very brave and principled of her.
The delicious part of all this is how much harder Trump is making her elected life. It’s like he’s just pushing and pushing and pushing to finally make her break. In reality, he probably doesn’t give a second thought to her, so he can do things like announce he’s going to put out a new list of potential Supreme Court nominees who will be avowed social conservatives, not like those traitors John Roberts and Neil Gorsuch. “I will only choose from this list,” of “Conservative Supreme Court Justice Nominees” he tweeted. It’s “more important than ever” he continued, because “Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religous Liberty, etc.“ Have fun with that, Collins.
The odious Sen. Josh Hawley from Missouri stepped in to rub Collin’s nose in it a little bit. “I will vote only for those Supreme Court nominees who have explicitly acknowledged that Roe v. Wade is wrongly decided,” Hawley said in an interview with The Washington Post. “By explicitly acknowledged, I mean on the record and before they were nominated.” That’s the marker laid out for Trump and any nominee he could name—all of the groups Trump is trying to court, to keep on his team, will now point to that as their bottom line.
That leaves Collins, and to a lesser extent her sorta pro-choice colleague Lisa Murkowski, hanging out to dry. And their fellow Republicans don’t give a damn. They’ll happily sacrifice these two. The best hope these two, but particularly Collins, had in a Trump regime was to go independent and try to create a “moderate” bloc with the likes of Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. It’s too late for that, particularly for Collins.
She’s in a jam right now, and trying to get out of it only makes it worse for her, because she’s really bad at this politics thing. Every word out of her mouth is disingenuous, this supposed principled, independent moderate. But it’s what she signed up for when she voted for Trump’s nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.

Clayton County and ruled that LGBTQ residents of the U.S. were protected against workplace discrimination. Fundamentalist evangelicals felt betrayed, but Gorsuch’s defenders argued that he arrived at his decision because he is a “textualist.” Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, examines Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy in an article published in The Atlantic — and poses the question: how should a textualist deal with problematic case law?
“Justice Neil Gorsuch is a proud textualist,” Blackman writes. “According to this approach, what Congress intended or expected when it passed a law doesn’t matter. What matters are the words printed on paper. In practice, Justice Gorsuch will strictly follow the text of statutes, no matter what result it yields. Last month, he decided that the 1964 Civil Rights Act has always prohibited LGBTQ discrimination — everyone had simply missed it for half a century.”
In Bostock v. Clayton County, Blackman notes, Gorsuch “insisted he was sticking to the text, the whole text and nothing but the text. Alas, he wasn’t.”
According to Blackman, Gorsuch’s “interpretation was shaded by the work of justices who had not been so careful about text. …. Justice Gorsuch failed to acknowledge that the Court’s precedents were inconsistent with textualism. In doing so, he inadvertently undermined textualism’s justification. One can’t profess to follow the original meaning of a text while, in fact, following precedents that ignored that meaning.”
Gorsuch, Blackman adds, “did not begin his analysis” in Bostock v. Clayton County “by interpreting this text on a blank slate. Rather, he simply assumed that decades of case law had accurately interpreted the crucial phrase ‘discriminate against because of sex.’ Indeed, he treated decades of precedent as part of the ‘law’s ordinary meaning’ in 1964. This approach built an elaborate textualist framework on quicksand.”
For textualists, Blackman notes, a “fluid approach” is a “bitter pill…. to swallow” — and Blackman explains how Gorsuch’s approach in Bostock compared to his approach in McGirt v. Oklahoma, which dealt with Native American territories.
“In Bostock,” Blackman writes, “Justice Gorsuch quietly accepted precedent that paid little attention to text. In McGirt, he quietly rejected precedent that paid little attention to text. In both cases, he erected elaborate textualist structures on top of a foundation well worn by the Court’s prior decisions. And in neither case did he acknowledge the relationship between precedent and textualism.”
Blackman concludes his article by arguing that Gorsuch sometimes practices “precedentialism” rather actual textualism.
Gorsuch, according to Blackman, “preaches textualism, but practices precedentialism. This approach, in the long run, will serve only to undermine textualism. If Justice Gorsuch wants to move the law away from nebulous, flimsy reasoning toward more textualist, neutral principles, he must account for both text and precedent.”

0,2020-07-28T02:13:02+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/5-takeaways-from-bill-barrs-strident-and-fraudulent-opening-salvo-to-congress/,5 takeaways from Bill Barr’s strident and fraudulent opening salvo to Congress,"Attorney General Bill Barr is finally testifying before the House of Representatives after delaying for more than a year, and he’s opening with a bang.
Ahead of his Tuesday hearing, Politico published a copy of his opening statement. It’s mendacious, hypocritical, aggressive, and inflammatory. He’s not going to Congress to make friends or mollify his critics. He’s going to spit fire.
Here are 5 key takeaways from his testimony:
1. Despite being one of the most openly partisan attorneys general in recent history, Barr pledges to keep the Justice Department non-partisan.
We are in a time when the political discourse in Washington often reflects the politically divided nation in which we live, and too often drives that divide even deeper. Political rhetoric is inherent in our democratic system, and politics is to be expected by politicians, especially in an election year. While that may be appropriate here on Capitol Hill or on cable news, it is not acceptable at the Department of Justice. At the Department, decisions must be made with no regard to political pressure—pressure from either end of Pennsylvania Avenue, or from the media or mobs.
2. In the paragraph after pledging to avoid political rhetoric, he launches a strident attack on the Russia investigation and Democrats.
Ever since I made it clear that I was going to do everything I could to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus “Russiagate” scandal, many of the Democrats on this Committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the President’s factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions. Judging from the letter inviting me to this hearing, that appears to be your agenda today.
It’s hard to imagine how one can write these two paragraphs in succession and not see the glaring irony, but apparently Barr is so steeped in his own warped view of the world that he can’t imagine — or just doesn’t care — how his words will seem to outsiders.
3. He brazenly lies and says the president plays an appropriate role in Justice Department matters.
From my experience, the President has played a role properly and traditionally played by Presidents. Like his predecessors, President Trump and his National Security Council have appropriately weighed in on law-enforcement decisions that directly implicate national security or foreign policy, because those decisions necessarily involve considerations that transcend typical prosecutorial factors. Moreover, when some noteworthy event occurs that potentially has legal ramifications – such as leaks of classified information, potential civil rights abuses by police, or illegal price fixing or gouging – the President has occasionally, and appropriately, confirmed that the Department is aware of the matter. But the handling of the matter and my decisions on criminal matters have been left to my independent judgment, based on the law and fact, without any direction or interference from the White House or anyone outside the Department.
This is absolute nonsense. Anyone paying attention knows that Barr’s predecessor, Jeff Sessions, was fired by the president precisely because he refused to improperly intervene in a criminal investigation on his behalf. The events leading up to Barr’s appointment are documented in detail in the Mueller report, which completely obliterates the attorney general’s claim. This inevitably puts pressure on Barr, whether he acknowledges it or not, to stay in line.
And Trump continues to openly comment on and call for specific outcomes in federal criminal matters on Twitter and in remarks to reporters, often for clearly venal reasons. It is so frequent and so bad that Barr himself has publicly complained about it before:
I’m happy to say that, in fact, the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case. However, to have public statements and tweets made about the department, about our people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we’re doing our work with integrity.
4. He claims all of his decisions are entirely non-partisan.
When asked to consider returning, I did so because I revere the Department and believed my independence would allow me to help steer her back to her core mission of applying one standard of justice for everyone and enforcing the law even-handedly, without partisan considerations. Since returning to the Department, I have done precisely that.
Even as he’s engaging in fiery partisan rhetoric and blatantly lying on the president’s behalf, Barr paints himself as the last bastion of non-partisanship in Washington. Whether or not he actually believes this to be true, it’s clearly not, and it’s shameful that he can’t admit it.
He indulges in belligerent screeds against “secularists,” and he blames left-wing radicals for violence while ignoring right-wing extremists. Before he was appointed attorney general, he already dismissed the basis of the Russia investigation while declaring that there was more justification to investigate Hillary Clinton. He cheered James Comey’s decision to announce the reopening of the Clinton email investigation days before the 2016 election, and then he turned around and cheered Trump’s firing of Comey in 2017 — which was justified on the grounds of Comey’s treatment of Clinton.
5. Barr insisted lawmakers should condemn the protester violence in Portland while making no mention of the extensive abuses by law enforcement in response to the protests.
As elected officials of the federal government, every Member of this Committee – regardless of your political views or your feelings about the Trump Administration – should condemn violence against federal officers and destruction of federal property. So should state and local leaders who have a responsibility to keep their communities safe. To tacitly condone destruction and anarchy is to abandon the basic rule-of-law principles that should unite us even in a politically divisive time. At the very least, we should all be able to agree that there is no place in this country for armed mobs that seek to establish autonomous zones beyond government control, or tear down statues and monuments that law-abiding communities chose to erect, or to destroy the property and livelihoods of innocent business owners. The most basic responsibility of government is to ensure the rule of law, so that people can live their lives safely and without fear. The Justice Department will continue working to meet that solemn responsibility.
These remarks are clearly not in keeping with his pledge, quoted above, to keep political rhetoric out of the Justice Department. But more troublingly, it shows that Barr has no concerns for the vast and widespread abuses committed by law enforcement — federal, state, and local — under his watch. He condemned the killing of George Floyd, but he also tries to diminish it by painting such incidents as extremely rare. He doesn’t mention the violence committed at his command against peaceful protests during the recent clearing of Lafayette Square.

0,2020-07-28T01:10:16+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/white-supremacists-carried-out-violence-under-the-banner-of-black-lives-matter-richmond-mayor/,White supremacists carried out violence ‘under the banner of Black Lives Matter’: Richmond mayor,"Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney told reporters over the weekend that white supremacists infiltrated local Black Lives Matter protests and initiated violence after weeks of largely peaceful demonstrations.
Officials said that 23 people were arrested over the weekend in connection with the protests.
“What happened last night was violence,” Stoney said. “Violence that hurt many people in the Richmond community, both through the threatening of lives and the destruction of property. And simply put: That is unacceptable in the city of Richmond.”
He continued: “So after 24 consecutive days of peaceful protest, what changed last night? Let me tell you what I think changed last night: There were white supremacists marching under the banner of Black Lives Matter, attempting to undermine an otherwise overwhelmingly peaceful movement towards social justice.”
The Washington Post noted:
He offered little direct evidence of outside influence, though officials said Monday that was still under investigation. Police Chief Gerald M. Smith said that fliers promoting anti-police rallies for the weekend had been produced outside of Richmond and that several of the people arrested were from other parts of the state.
“Last night takes us more steps backwards,” Stoney said. “It takes us backwards.”
“We have identified some individuals who have been seen with the Boogaloo boys and some Antifa groups around the area,” said Richmond Police Chief Gerald Smith at the conference, as WTVR reported. “The majority of those individuals who were there last night were Caucasian.”
The Post detailed the reasons given for the arrests at the protests:
Six people were arrested Saturday night — five charged with unlawful assembly and the sixth with assault of a police officer.
On Sunday night, after a similar flier was distributed, police “took a proactive approach,” Smith said Monday. Officers were waiting at Monroe Park, a gathering place for protesters that closed at 10 p.m. When people failed to disperse after closing, police moved in and made 17 arrests — including at least one reporter for the VCU campus newspaper who was covering the protests.
The charges included trespassing, rioting, possessing a weapon with an extended magazine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.

0,2020-07-28T00:08:18+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-sadism-and-gross-abuse-of-power-means-its-time-to-impeach-him-again/,Trump’s sadism and gross abuse of power means it’s time to impeach him again,"For the past week or more, many folks in media and politics, including those of us at Salon, have been accusing Donald Trump of sending federal police into Portland, Oregon — and now a bit further north in Seattle — almost entirely to stoke violence that he thinks will help him win re-election. Not that such speculation was a big reach, of course. It was plainly obvious that politics, not any real concern about “law and order,” was driving Trump’s decision.
For one thing, while protests against police brutality have been ongoing in those cities since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, they were largely winding down — until Trump’s goons showed up and started snatching people without cause, beating protesters and tear-gassing peaceful crowds. For another thing, local and state politicians in Oregon have pleaded with Trump and his minions — especially acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf — to pull out the federal police, who are geared up to look like an invading army. Oregon’s attorney general has filed suit against the federal government over this abuse of power, although a federal judge denied her request for a restraining order. Third, if Trump actually gave a crap about protecting Americans, he would be focused on fighting the coronavirus, not a bunch of young people setting off fireworks and spray-painting buildings.
But now White House aides have come right out and admitted that the reason Trump is waging war on American cities and terrorizing peaceful protesters is because he thinks it will look awesome in his campaign ads.
In an article published Friday, the Washington Post reported that “Trump’s campaign officials say that the president wants to amplify his law-and-order message” and that Portland was chosen not because of any real threat to anyone’s safety in the city, but because Trump and his aides felt it was the best “theater for his fight.”
Trump has shown far more interest in this campaign stunt — one that involves tear-gassing, beating and terrorizing real people for the purposes of campaign advertising — than he ever has in the fight against the coronavirus. Trump gets up early in the morning, the Post reported, eager to call Wolf “for real-time updates from the front.”
Trump’s behavior isn’t just gross and sadistic. It is also an abuse of power and a misuse of taxpayer funds, which are being deployed openly for the purpose of creating campaign materials. The fact that he’s using the bodies of innocent people as props in his brutal campaign theater just makes the entire situation worse.
Under the circumstances, as wearying as it is to say this, the Democrats need to impeach Trump. Yes, again.
Over the weekend, the editorial page editor at the Washington Post, Fred Hiatt, published an op-ed detailing the many impeachable offenses Trump has committed since he was formally impeached by the House of Representatives last December. (He was acquitted in the Senate, despite being obviously guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, because 52 of the 53 Republicans in the chamber — the exception being Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah — refused to convict him.)
Trump’s “abuse of law-enforcement powers” with “the recent, reckless deployment of federal forces into U.S. cities for political purposes” is an impeachable offense, Hiatt argues. He points out that this offense dwarfs even the abuse of law enforcement powers of previous weeks, such as Trump’s dismissal of Justice Department officials for investigating his abundant corruption and abusing his presidential powers to let his criminal cronies off the hook.
Hiatt says he’s “not suggesting that the House should again impeach the president” so close to the election, when it should be left up to “the voters to render judgment.”
That sounds reasonable at first, but Hiatt overlooks a crucial factor: Trump’s abuse of law enforcement powers is putting the well-being and even the lives of Americans in peril, while also illegally trying to stomp out their First Amendment rights. Unless someone stops him, Trump will continue to escalate these tactics — and there’s a real chance people could be killed by these federal goons. (Trump’s provocations have already led to one inadvertent death, when a motorist shot a protester in Austin, Texas.) Impeachment may be the only way for Congress to stop Trump’s unjustified violence against the citizens he was supposedly elected to serve.
Back in December, Trump was caught red-handed in the act of trying to cheat in the 2020 elections by using his office’s powers to blackmail the president of Ukraine to aid a smear campaign against Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. These attacks on Portland and Seattle are the same thing: Trump is abusing his powers in order to create a false campaign narrative about “violent anarchists” that he hopes can be used to distract from his immense failings as president.
The punditocracy may view the impeachment of Trump in 2019 as a failure, since the Senate, run by corrupt Republicans, failed to convict him.
In truth, the impeachment served at least one important purpose: It stopped Trump’s illegal scheme to blackmail Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, in its tracks.
Remember, Zelensky was about to give in to Trump’s threats and promise a phony Biden “investigation” in exchange for the military aid Congress had already authorized, but Trump was withholding. A CNN interview was scheduled for September, in which Zelensky likely intended to do Trump’s bidding and smear Biden. But when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry, drawing attention to Trump’s criminal behavior, Zelensky’s interview was canceled.
While it’s not certain that Trump would pull back his federal police in the face of another impeachment inquiry, previous experience shows that he can be compelled to scale down his corrupt schemes in the face of exposure on the level that an impeachment inquiry brings. Considering that people’s health and lives are on the line, it’s worth making the effort. Congress has a duty to protect Americans from a violent president who is waging war on them for political gain.
It’s tempting to debate the politics of this, of course. One side would argue that holding impeachment hearings highlighting Trump’s abuse of power — which could feature witnesses such as the local politicians and victims of federal police tactics — will help focus the public’s attentions on Trump’s corruption. The other side would argue that it’s a distraction from the ongoing issues of the pandemic and collapsing economy, and could backfire if the public decides the impeachment itself is political. Pelosi, no doubt, would not be keen to spend time on another impeachment process as Democrats in Congress are trying to rescue the country from economic catastrophe, in the face of Republican intransigence.
But what was true last December is still true now: Ultimately, there’s no way to know for certain how impeachment hearings would play out politically.
What is known, however, is the morality of this situation. What Trump is doing is illegal and immoral. It’s incumbent on those who actually care about the safety of Americans to do whatever they can to stop his cynical campaign of violence against citizens who are exercising their free speech rights. Oregon is already fighting this in the courts. Congress needs to back state officials up by invoking the only power that has so far worked to curtail Trump’s abuses: Impeachment.

0,2020-07-27T23:41:53+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/fox-news-host-is-quickly-back-peddling-after-spreading-dangerous-qanon-nonsense-on-air/,Fox News host is quickly back-peddling after spreading dangerous QAnon nonsense on air,"Fox News host Jesse Watters has walked back comments he made praising the bizarre QAnon conspiracy theory during a Saturday interview with Eric Trump.
Watters called QAnon a “fringe group” — which he does not “support or believe in” — in a statement to Mediaite one day after he praised it for uncovering “a lot of great stuff.”
QAnon is a conspiracy theory that started on the imageboard 4chan in which a would-be secret operative with classified information posts clues to followers about the “deep state” and a baseless plot by President Donald Trump to destroy a global sex trafficking ring allegedly involving high-profile Democrats and their celebrity supporters.
What began as a widely-mocked fringe group has now grown into a widely-mocked insurgency within the Republican Party. There are numerous QAnon supporters and boosters running in Republican races around the country. Oregon Republicans recently nominated a QAnon conspiracy theorist as their U.S. Senate candidate.
Twitter recently cracked down on a network of accounts linked to QAnon over their “potential to lead to offline harm.” Facebook is preparing similar steps, according to The New York Times. QAnon adherents have pushed the Pizzagate conspiracy, a baseless claim that high-profile Democrats were running a child sex ring out of a Washington pizzeria which was followed by a shooting, and more recently, a bizarre claim that the furniture outlet Wayfair was secretly trafficking missing children in ads for high-priced storage cabinets.
Watters took issue with the ban during his Saturday interview with Eric Trump.
“Twitter has basically cracked down and eliminated about 7,000 accounts and another 100,000 accounts are now in the cross-hairs.” he said. “Do you think this is an attempt to interfere in an election? Because, you know, Q can do some crazy stuff with the pizza stuff and the Wayfair stuff, but they also uncovered a lot of great stuff when it comes to Epstein and the deep state.”
Many of the QAnon “deep state” claims have been debunked and, as NBC News reporter Ben Collins noted, it has not “uncovered a lot of great stuff when it comes to Epstein.”
“The Epstein reporting was by actual reporters at newspapers, bastardized by Q to fit a narrative about Satanic child cannibalism,” Collins wrote on Twitter. “Deeply irresponsible garbage by Fox News.”
After questioning whether blocking accounts linked to the fringe group would qualify as “election interference,” Watters compared the group to the anti-fascist movement Antifa.
“I never saw Q as dangerous as Antifa. But Antifa gets to run wild on the internet, what do you think is going on there?” Watters asked.
Eric Trump, who has promoted the conspiracy theory on Instagram, did not engage with the QAnon comments but agreed with Watters’ assertion that cracking down on the baseless conspiracy theory was tantamount to election interference.
“They are literally putting their finger on the scales of a U.S. election,” Trump argued.
“You have some little dweeb in Silicon Valley, who’s 22 years old. He’s a tech savant,” he said. “He’s running Twitter or one of these companies, and he literally has his finger on the power of a presidential election.”
ICYMI, last night Human Jager Bomb Jesse Watters praised QAnon for uncovering “a lot of great stuff” on Jeffrey Epstein (that was journalists) and the deep state (lmao), and asked the president’s son if banning QAnon accounts is “election interference.” https://t.co/vVy4Y2VIq1 pic.twitter.com/pPrMk4OjUI
— Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) July 26, 2020
Journalists condemned Watters and Fox for praising the group on the air.
“I can’t begin to tell you how validating this segment will be for QAnon followers and how dangerous that is,” journalist Yashar Ali wrote. “QAnon followers are deeply detached from reality and they constantly look for validation of their beliefs. They look for what they see as codes from people they support. A top Fox News host endorsing QAnon while the president’s son nods along is all they need.”
Watters later issued a statement walking the comments back.
“While discussing the double standard of big tech censorship,” he said Sunday, “I mentioned the conspiracy group QAnon, which I don’t support or believe in. My comments should not be mistaken for giving credence to this fringe platform.”

0,2020-07-27T23:14:19+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-the-truth-about-the-supposed-return-of-manufacturing-under-trump/,Here’s the truth about the supposed return of manufacturing under Trump,"The headline from the Commerce Department’s new report on the economy is that new shipments and new orders of durable goods by U.S .manufacturers increased at healthy rates in June – by 15 percent and 7 percent respectively. Larry Kudlow almost certainly will herald the numbers as proof that American manufacturing is back, and good times are just around the corner.
Don’t believe it.  Only one industry, motor vehicles and parts, was responsible for almost all of the gains. June shipments of motor vehicles and parts jumped 80 percent from their abysmal levels in May, and new orders increased 87 percent.  Set aside that industry, however, and U.S. durable goods manufacturers treaded water or worse in June. Their shipments were up less than 4 percent, and their new orders fell more than 6 percent.
The story is the same for the capital goods that businesses order and buy to maintain or expand operations: In June, shipments by capital goods manufacturers increased 3.5 percent and their new orders fell 16.5 percent.
As everyone in the industrial Midwest knows, all parts of durable goods manufacturing continue to operate at depressed levels. American manufacturers of all durable goods shipped 8.5 percent less in June than in February, before the pandemic and the Trump administration’s mishandling of it. Their new orders were 16 percent lower in June compared to February.
Despite the bounce back in June by manufacturers of motor vehicles and their parts, these companies still shipped 12 percent less in June than in February, and their new orders were 11 percent lower. Finally, manufacturers of capital goods shipped 7.5 percent less in June than February, and their new orders were 28 percent lower in June than February.
The question for Americans during the campaign is one Ronald Reagan asked the electorate forty years ago: Are you better off now than you were both four years ago? Actually, it’s: Are you better off now than you were four months ago? The answer is clear.

0,2020-07-27T22:48:19+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/mitch-mcconnells-new-plan-to-slash-unemployment-payments-could-trigger-financial-catastrophe-for-millions/,Mitch McConnell’s new plan to slash unemployment payments could trigger financial catastrophe for millions,"Progressives are rejecting out of hand a proposal by Senate Republicans to temporarily slash the weekly federal boost to unemployment benefits from $600 to $200 until states develop the capacity to implement a more complex system that would pay laid-off workers 70% of what they earned prior to losing their jobs.
Bloomberg reported Monday that the Senate GOP plan, which was approved by the Trump White House, will call for a two-month transition to the new unemployment system and provide states with an option to apply for a waiver for up to two additional months. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expected to officially unveil the plan later Monday as part of the GOP’s coronavirus stimulus package.
“Millions of Americans are out of work and millions of renters will soon face eviction,” said advocacy group Patriotic Millionaires. “Meanwhile, Trump and Senate Republicans want to cut unemployment benefits from $600 to $200 a week. Absolutely unacceptable.”
Analysts warn that replacing the flat $600-per-week payment with an individualized benefit would overwhelm antiquated state unemployment insurance (UI) systems, potentially causing massive relief delays for millions of people on the brink of financial collapse.
Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project, tweeted Monday that the GOP’s proposed “70% income replacement is a weird technocratic solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.”
“This would require a different individual calculation for every person. States will take months to get this up while still processing historic new claims,” Evermore wrote. “The fact that low income folks are getting more on UI is a good thing and has kept unemployed workers’ pain from spreading in their communities. This is giving people the economic power to make good choices to slow the spread of Covid, which is out of control.”
Under the GOP proposal, the $400-per-week reduction in UI payments would be implemented as states transition to the wage replacement program. The change would amount to a $1,600 monthly income cut for the tens of millions of Americans currently relying on the boosted UI benefits to cover basic expenses.
The steep benefit reduction would also cost the U.S. more than three million jobs over the next year, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
Unless Congress reaches a deal to avoid a lapse in additional federal payments, state unemployment benefits will revert to the pre-pandemic rate—which averaged about $370 per week nationwide—starting August 1.
“Senate Republicans want to cut unemployment benefits for 30 million Americans by $400 a week,” tweeted Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). “This cannot stand.”

With bipartisan negotiations over the stimulus package expected to begin late Monday, Democratic leaders have not said the Republican unemployment proposal is a deal-breaker.
Asked about the UI payments in an appearance on CBS “Face the Nation” Sunday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the GOP’s 70% wage replacement idea as overly complicated but said “you don’t go into a negotiation with a red line.”
In May, the House passed a bill that proposes extending the $600-per-week benefit through January of next year. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced legislation earlier this month that would extend the $600 weekly UI boost until economic conditions improve.
“These negotiations are absurd,” HuffPost senior reporter Zach Carter tweeted Monday. “The country is on fire and the chief concern for Senate Republicans is that unemployed people have too much money.”

That’s taking a worrying turn as the state’s incompetent Gov. Ron DeSantis remains absolutely determined to open schools mere weeks from now: There are now over 31,000 children in the state who have tested positive for the virus.
That isn’t just a new high. As CNN reports, cases among children have soared 34% in just the past eight days. That means the last week has seen about 1,000 new cases among children each day.
The Trump administration’s various toadies and hangers-on, along with Fox News talking heads and other conspiracy theorists, continue to assert that children aren’t affected by the virus and can’t easily spread it. They’re lying, and they’re lying as part of the overall effort to restart the all-valued economy before the full ramifications of the Trump administration’s catastrophic incompetence result in late-election mass poverty. Three hundred Florida children have been hospitalized—50 of them in the past week—and that number can also be expected to increase sharply. There’s no evident way to track how many of those children have spread the virus to others, because Florida. As the percent of positive tests ticks up—CNN reports the positive rate among tested children in Martin County, just north of Palm Beach, is over 25%—there’s no plausible reason to believe Florida is even close to being able to measure the pandemic, much less contain it.
It’s not likely schools will reopen in the state. It’s simply not. No matter what retaliatory moves DeSantis takes to attempt to force them open, most teachers and most parents do not want children to die in order to boost conservative egos. Like Trump’s asinine pandemic political convention, DeSantis will likely have to retreat from his position while making it look somehow look like it was his idea all along, like the craven jackass that he is.
It is either that, or three months and many deaths from now state residents are very likely to burn down his office. There is a level of incompetence that in and of itself should be considered criminal, and “open the schools while a deadly pandemic rages still-uncontrolled through the state” is well, well on the other side of that line.

0,2020-07-27T21:44:33+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/a-slow-motion-nightmare-how-the-war-on-terror-kills-american-democracy/,A slow-motion nightmare: How the war on terror kills American democracy,"The phrase “thinking about the unthinkable” has always been associated with the unthinkable cataclysm of a nuclear war, and rightly so. Lately, though, I’ve been pondering another kind of unthinkable scenario, nearly as nightmarish (at least for a democracy) as a thermonuclear Armageddon, but one that’s been rolling out in far slower motion: that America’s war on terror never ends because it’s far more convenient for America’s leaders to keep it going — until, that is, it tears apart anything we ever imagined as democracy.
I fear that it either can’t or won’t end because, as Martin Luther King, Jr., pointed out in 1967 during the Vietnam War, the United States remains the world’s greatest purveyor of violence — and nothing in this century, the one he didn’t live to see, has faintly proved him wrong. Considered another way, Washington should be classified as the planet’s most committed arsonist, regularly setting or fanning the flames of fires globally from Libya to Iraq, Somalia to Afghanistan, Syria to — dare I say it — in some quite imaginable future Iran, even as our leaders invariably boast of having the world’s greatest firefighters (also known as the U.S. military).
Scenarios of perpetual war haunt my thoughts. For a healthy democracy, there should be few things more unthinkable than never-ending conflict, that steady drip-drip of death and destruction that drives militarism, reinforces authoritarianism, and facilitates disaster capitalism. In 1795, James Madison warned Americans that war of that sort would presage the slow death of freedom and representative government. His prediction seems all too relevant in a world in which, year after year, this country continues to engage in needless wars that have nothing to do with national defense.
You Wage War Long, You Wage It Wrong
To cite one example of needless war from the last century, consider America’s horrendous years of fighting in Vietnam and a critical lesson drawn firsthand from that conflict by reporter Jonathan Schell. “In Vietnam,” he noted, “I learned about the capacity of the human mind to build a model of experience that screens out even very dramatic and obvious realities.” As a young journalist covering the war, Schell saw that the U.S. was losing, even as its military was destroying startlingly large areas of South Vietnam in the name of saving it from communism. Yet America’s leaders, the “best and brightest” of the era, almost to a man refused to see that all of what passed for realism in their world, when it came to that war, was nothing short of a first-class lie.
Why? Because believing is seeing and they desperately wanted to believe that they were the good guys, as well as the most powerful guys on the planet. America was winning, it practically went without saying, because it had to be. They were infected by their own version of an all-American victory culture, blinded by a sense of this country’s obvious destiny: to be the most exceptional and exceptionally triumphant nation on this planet.
As it happened, it was far more difficult for grunts on the ground to deny the reality of what was happening — that they were fighting and dying in a senseless war. As a result, especially after the shock of the enemy’s Tet Offensive early in 1968, escalating protests within the military (and among veterans at home) together with massive antiwar demonstrations finally helped put the brakes on that war. Not before, however, more than 58,000 American troops died, along with millions of Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians.
In the end, the war in Indochina was arguably too costly, messy, and futile to continue. But never underestimate the military-industrial complex, especially when it comes to editing or denying reality, while being eternally over-funded for that very reality. It’s a trait the complex has shared with politicians of both parties. Don’t forget, for instance, the way President Ronald Reagan reedited that disastrous conflict into a “noble cause” in the 1980s. And give him credit! That was no small thing to sell to an American public that had already lived through such a war. By the way, tell me something about that Reaganesque moment doesn’t sound vaguely familiar almost four decades later when our very own “wartime president” long ago declared victory in the “war” on Covid-19, even as the death toll from that virus approaches 150,000 in the homeland.
In the meantime, the military-industrial complex has mastered the long con of the no-win forever war in a genuinely impressive fashion. Consider the war in Afghanistan. In 2021 it will enter its third decade without an end in sight. Even when President Trump makes noises about withdrawing troops from that country, Congress approves an amendment to another massive, record-setting military budget with broad bipartisan support that effectively obstructs any efforts to do so (while the Pentagon continues to bargain Trump down on the subject).
The Vietnam War, which was destroying the U.S. military, finally ended in an ignominious withdrawal. Almost two decades later, after the 2001 invasion, the war in Afghanistan can now be — the dream of the Vietnam era — fought in a “limited” fashion, at least from the point of view of Congress, the Pentagon, and most Americans (who ignore it), even if not the Afghans. The number of American troops being killed is, at this point, acceptably low, almost imperceptible in fact (even if not to Americans who have lost loved ones over there).
More and more, the U.S. military is relying on air power, unmanned drones, mercenaries, local militias, paramilitaries, and private contractors. Minimizing American casualties is an effective way of minimizing negative media coverage here; so, too, are efforts by the Trump administration to classify nearly everything related to that war while denying or downplaying “collateral damage” — that is, dead civilians — from it.
Their efforts boil down to a harsh truth: America just plain lies about its forever wars, so that it can keep on killing in lands far from home.
When we as Americans refuse to take in the destruction we cause, we come to passively accept the belief system of the ruling class that what’s still bizarrely called “defense” is a “must have” and that we collectively must spendsignificantly more than a trillion dollars a year on the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, and a sprawling network of intelligence agencies, all justified as necessary defenders of America’s freedom. Rarely does the public put much thought into the dangers inherent in a sprawling “defense” network that increasingly invades and dominates our lives.
Meanwhile, it’s clear that low-cost wars, at least in terms of U.S. troops killed and wounded in action, can essentially be prolonged indefinitely, even when they never result in anything faintly like victory or fulfill any faintly useful American goal. The Afghan War remains the case in point. “Progress” is a concept that only ever fits the enemy — the Taliban continues to gain ground — yet, in these years, figures like retired general and former CIA director David Petraeus have continued to call for a “generational” commitment of troops and resources there, akin to U.S. support for South Korea.
Who says the Pentagon leadership learned nothing from Vietnam? They learned how to wage open-ended wars basically forever, which has proved useful indeed when it comes to justifying and sustaining epic military budgets and the political authority that goes with them. But here’s the thing: in a democracy, if you wage war long, you wage it wrong. Athens and the historian Thucydides learned this the hard way in the struggle against Sparta more than two millennia ago. Why do we insist on forgetting such an obvious lesson?
“We Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us”
World War II was arguably the last war Americans truly had to fight. My Uncle Freddie was in the Army and stationed at Pearl Harbor when it was attacked on December 7, 1941. The country then came together and won a global conflict (with lots of help) in 44 months, emerging as the planetary superpower to boot. Now, that superpower is very much on the wane, as Donald Trump recognized in running successfully as a declinist candidate for president in 2016. (Make America Great Again!) And yet, though he ran against this country’s forever wars and is now president, we’re approaching the third decade of a war on terror that has yielded little, spread radical Islamic terror outfits across an expanse of the planet, and still seemingly has no end.
“Great nations do not fight endless wars,” Trump himself claimed only last year. Yet that’s exactly what this country has been doing, regardless of which party ruled the roost in Washington. And here’s where, to give him credit, Trump actually had a certain insight. America is no longer great precisely because of the endless wars we wage and all the largely hidden but associated costs that go with them, including the recently much publicized militarization of the police here at home. Yet, in promising to make America great again, President Trump has failed to end those wars, even as he’s fed the military-industrial complex with even greater piles of cash.
There’s a twisted logic to all this. As the leading purveyor of violence and terror, with its leaders committed to fighting Islamic terrorism across the planet until the phenomenon is vanquished, the U.S. inevitably becomes its own opponent, conducting a perpetual war on itself. Of course, in the process, Afghans, Iraqis, Libyans, Syrians, Somalis, and Yemenis, among other peoples on this embattled planet of ours, pay big time, but Americans pay, too. (Have you even noticed that high-speed railroad that’s unbuilt, that dam in increasing disrepair, those bridges that need fixing, while money continues to pour into the national security state?) As the cartoon possum Pogo once so classically said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.”
Early in the Iraq War, General Petraeus asked a question that was relevant indeed: “Tell me how this [war] ends.” The answer, obvious to so many who had protested in the global streets over the invasion to come in 2003, was “not well.” Today, another answer should be obvious: never, if the Pentagon and America’s political and national security elite have anything to do with it. In thermodynamics class, I learned that a perpetual motion machine is impossible to create due to entropy. The Pentagon never took that in and has instead been hard at work proving that a perpetual military machine is possible… until, that is, the empire it feeds off of collapses and takes us with it.
America’s Military Complex as a Cytokine Storm
In the era of Covid-19, as cases and deaths from the pandemic continue to soar in America, it’s astonishing that military spending is also soaring to record levels despite a medical emergency and a major recession.
The reality is that, in the summer of 2020, America faces two deadly viruses. The first is Covid-19. With hard work and some luck, scientists may be able to mass-produce an effective vaccine for it, perhaps by as early as next spring. In the meantime, scientists do have a sense of how to control it, contain it, even neutralize it, as countries from South Korea and New Zealand to Denmark have shown, even if some Americans, encouraged by our president, insist on throwing all caution to the winds in the name of living free. The second virus, however, could prove even more difficult to control, contain, and neutralize: forever war, a pandemic that U.S. military forces, with their global strike missions, continue to spread across the globe.
Sadly, it’s a reasonable bet that in the long run, even with Donald Trump as president, America has a better chance of defeating Covid-19 than the virus of forever war. At least, the first is generally seen as a serious threat (even if not by a president blind to anything but his chances for reelection); the second is, however, still largely seen as evidence of our strength and exceptionalism. Indeed, Americans tend to imagine “our” military not as a dangerous virus but as a set of benevolent antibodies, defending us from global evildoers.
When it comes to America’s many wars, perhaps there’s something to be learned from the way certain people’s immune systems respond to Covid-19. In some cases, the virus sparks an exaggerated immune response that drives the body into a severe inflammatory state known as a cytokine storm. That “storm” can lead to multiple organ failure followed by death, yet it occurs in the cause of defending the body from a viral attack.
In a similar fashion, America’s exaggerated response to 19 hijackers on 9/11 and then to perceived threats around the globe, especially the nebulous threat of terror, has led to an analogous (if little noticed) cytokine storm in the American system. Military (and militarized police) antibodies have been sapping our resources, inflaming our body politic, and slowly strangling the vital organs of democracy. Left unchecked, this “storm” of inflammatory militarism will be the death of democracy in America.
To put this country right, what’s needed is not only an effective vaccine for Covid-19 but a way to control the “antibodies” produced by America’s forever wars abroad and, as the years have gone by, at home — and the ways they’ve attacked and inflamed the collective U.S. political, social, and economic body. Only when we find ways to vaccinate ourselves against the destructive violence of those wars, whether on foreign streets or our own, can we begin to heal as a democratic society.
To survive, the human body needs a healthy immune system, so when it goes haywire, becomes wildly inflamed, and ends up attacking and degrading our vital organs, we’re in trouble deep. It’s a reasonable guess that, in analogous terms, American democracy is already on a ventilator and beginning to feel the effects of multiple organ failure.
Unlike a human patient, doctors can’t put our democracy into a medically induced coma. But collectively we should be working to suppress our overactive immune system before it kills us. In other words, it’s truly time to defund that military machine of ours, as well as the militarized version of the police, and rethink how actual threats can be neutralized without turning every response into an endless war.
So many years later, it’s time to think the unthinkable. For the U.S. government that means — gasp! — peace. Such a peace would start with imperial retrenchment (bring our troops home!), much reduced military (and police) budgets, and complete withdrawal from Afghanistan and any other place associated with that “generational” war on terror. The alternative is a cytokine storm that will, in the end, tear us apart from within.

As I wrote at the time, what that really meant was that Barr would be able to selectively release classified information that bolstered his charge that the previous administration had spied on the Trump campaign. According to the New York Times, that is exactly what is happening.
Not long after the early 2017 publication of a notorious dossier about President Trump jolted Washington, an expert in Russian politics told the F.B.I. he had been one of its key sources, drawing on his contacts to deliver information that would make up some of the most salacious and unproven assertions in the document.
The F.B.I. had approached the expert, a man named Igor Danchenko, as it vetted the dossier’s claims. He agreed to tell investigators what he knew with an important condition, people familiar with the matter said — that the F.B.I. keep his identity secret so he could protect himself, his sources and his family and friends in Russia.
But his hope of remaining anonymous evaporated last week after Attorney General William P. Barr directed the F.B.I. to declassify a redacted report about its three-day interview of Mr. Danchenko in 2017 and hand it over to Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Graham promptly made the interview summary public while calling the entire Russia investigation “corrupt.”
The NYT report goes on to say that, while Danchenko’s name was redacted in the released document, it was just a matter of days before “online sleuths” (Russian agents?) were able to identify him based on clues left visible in the declassified document.
Trump’s enablers immediately engaged in a smear campaign against Danchenko and his one-time employer, the Brookings Institution. Not only does all of that put Danchenko and his family at risk, it sends a message to potential intelligence sources that the United States can’t be trusted to keep their word.
But while the attorney general demonstrates that he is more interested in punishing Trump’s accusers than he is in this country’s national security, it is important to keep in mind that this whole charade is based on a lie. From the beginning, efforts to defend the president have been based on convincing everyone that the entire Trump-Russia investigation was based on the Steele dossier. Therefore, Trump and his enablers believe that if that document can be discredited, it shows that the whole thing was a hoax—or even an attempted coup.
So it is once again time to review the evidence. According to the Mueller report, the FBI investigation was launched when they received word that George Papadopoulos (a Trump campaign advisor) told an Australian diplomat that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton. That is the same conclusion reached in the bipartisan report from the Senate Intelligence Committee and the investigation conducted by Inspector General Michael Horowitz. Here is what the latter reported (emphasis mine).
Although Trump and his supporters have repeatedly insisted that the investigation was built on the back of an uncorroborated dossier, the report categorically states that the dossier was not part of the July 2016 decision to open the investigation. In fact, the team responsible for the investigation didn’t even get copies of his reports until two months later.
In other words, no matter how often Trump and his enablers say that the Trump-Russia investigation was launched based on the Steele dossier, that is a lie—and they know it. The Crossfire Hurricane team didn’t even see the dossier until September, two months after the investigation was launched. By then, not only did the team know about what Papadopoulos has been bragging about, they knew that Trump had hired Paul Manafort to be his campaign manager and Michael Flynn to be his senior foreign policy advisor—both of whom had ties to the Russian government.
The question this whole obsession with the Steele dossier raises is why Trump and his enablers continue to lie about how it was used by the investigators. When the Attorney General of the United States and the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee are willing to risk national security in furtherance of a lie, are they simply trying to punish the president’s accusers or are they attempting to cover up something much more serious? Perhaps both.

In the interview, Fauci “was pressed to explain why, months after COVID-19 first reached U.S. soil, the U.S. government is still struggling to provide adequate testing for Americans and sufficient personal protective gear for essential workers” — and the immunologist responded, “We keep hearing when we go to these task force meetings that these (issues) are being corrected. But yet, when you go into the trenches, you still hear about that.”
Fauci told ABC News he doesn’t have a “good answer” and “cannot explain” why the U.S. government has been dropping the ball when it comes to coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment.
“As a scientist,” Fauci explained, “the thing you must always do is to be humble enough to know that when you get additional information — even information that might conflict (with) what was felt earlier on —  you then change your viewpoint, and you change your recommendations based on the data. That’s what science is all about. Science is a learning process.”
During a White House press briefing on July 23, Trump claimed that the U.S. had experienced a “tremendous week” in its battle against COVID-19 and argued, “We’re doing very well all over the country.”
But Fauci, speaking with ABC News, sounded less optimistic.
Fauci said he is concerned about “a surge of community spread,” describing it as “a real serious problem.” U.S. residents who are infected with COVID-19 but aren’t showing any symptoms, Fauci warned, “need to be concerned because even though they themselves may not get any serious outcome, they are part of the propagation of the pandemic.”
The immunologist noted that it is still possible to slow down the spread of coronavirus, but Americans need to religiously follow safety precautions.
“The fundamentals are not rocket science,” Fauci told ABC News. “It’s universal wearing of masks, avoiding crowds, close the bars, (maintain) physical distance (and) personal hygiene, washing your hands. … No doubt, you’re going to be able to turn these things around with some things as simple as that.”

They work and live in the state, and they pay taxes. They’re not citizens, and they can’t vote.
Their presence in Texas increases the population of the state, and the number of people Texas sends to Congress is directly tied to the number of humans in the state. Not just voters, not just citizens. Humans.
The Trump administration wants to keep noncitizens out of the count used to determine how many people Texas sends to Congress. Undocumented immigrants may not be voters, but excluding people who live in and contribute to society is both undemocratic and unrepresentative. And it’s not about participation. We count kids, after all, because people who live under the laws made in Washington need elected advocates even if they can’t vote.
And this is a head-scratcher, if viewed through this lens of partisan politics: The Trump administration is backing a move that would shrink the power of the biggest Republican state in the U.S.
The move also seems out of line with the language in the U.S. Constitution: “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.”
Sure enough, a coalition led by Common Cause filed a legal challenge Friday, and others are expected to follow.
Only California has a larger undocumented immigrant population than Texas. Between them, those two states are home to an estimated 38.9% of the 10.6 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. And those two states — the biggest Democratic and Republican states in the union for the last several elections — would take the biggest hit in Congress and in the number of votes they cast in the Electoral College in presidential elections.
None of the proposed counting change would affect the 2020 elections, so there’s nothing in it for this president in November. But it will affect the balances in the next race, and in Congress after the 2022 elections.
Texas would, under the proposal, lose clout. So would California. What’s more, legislative and congressional districts within the state could be significantly different if redistricting maps were based on counts of citizens instead of population totals.
Here’s how this works right now. You count the national population every 10 years. You divide that number by 435 — the number of seats in the U.S. House — and you apportion those seats to the states, based on the number of people per congressional seat found in the first calculation. There’s some rounding, and each state, no matter its population, is guaranteed at least one seat in the House.
Based on the reapportionment that followed the 2010 census, Texas has 36 congressional representatives in addition to its two U.S. senators. By some estimates, growth in the population here — relative to other states — could add three seats to the delegation after the reapportionment that follows the 2020 census.
But that’s only if all of the people in the state count for purposes of representation. An estimated 1.8 million undocumented immigrants lived in the state in 2018. That’s enough people for more than two congressional seats; if they weren’t counted, Texas would be entitled to 34 seats in the House instead of 36.
Those are estimates. A practical problem with the new proposal is that the government was already barred from including citizenship questions in the census; how it would determine the number of people to include as citizens without such a question isn’t clear.
In a letter urging Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to take legal action to stop the proposal, state Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, framed the idea as an attack on Texas.
“Filing suit to block the Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce dated July 21 would be wholly consistent with your official biography that explains as Attorney General, you are ‘focused on protecting Texans and upholding Texas laws and the Constitution’ and ‘fighting federal overreach.’ Indeed, if unchallenged, the President’s actions would likely hurt Texas more than any other state.”
The partisan politics here are clear enough. Turner is the chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus. Paxton, a Republican, is the newly branded co-chair of the national Lawyers for Trump.
But not all that is political is partisan, even in an election year. Does anyone in elected office here think Texas should have less influence in Washington, D.C.?

0,2020-07-27T19:55:38+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/media-critic-slams-reporters-as-trump-plays-them-again-with-the-same-old-trick/,Media critic slams reporters as Trump plays them again with the same old trick,"Last week, many reporters commented on how much President Donald Trump had “changed his tone” when addressing the coronavirus pandemic. The president returned to holding White House press briefings on coronavirus, encouraged the use of face masks (after having mocked them repeatedly), and canceled the Jacksonville, Florida Republican National Convention due to safety concerns. But Parker Molloy, in a July 27 article for Media Matters, stresses that Trump changing his tone is not a new theme for journalists — who, according to Molloy, have been discussing Trump’s changes of tone for five years.
Looking back to 2015 — the year in which Trump launched his last presidential campaign — Molloy recalls, “Perhaps as a coping mechanism, playing to their own normalcy biases, the press desperately tried to find any glimmer of hope that the Republican frontrunner might not actually be the Trump that was barnstorming the country. Perhaps there was a different Trump beneath the surface. Perhaps, as candidates of the past had, Trump would become more moderate as he moved to win over voters across the political spectrum during the general election. Whatever subconscious reason for it, many in the media projected their own desire for normalcy onto a Trump avatar.”
Molloy adds, “Fast forward five years, and journalists and commentators are still talking about imminent pivots and praising him for always-temporary changes in his tone.”
Looking back, Molloy recalls that in February 2016, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, wondered if Americans could look forward to seeing “a less blunt, less angry Donald Trump.” Then, in April 2016, Molloy adds, CNN’s Brooke Baldwin argued that Trump was “appearing less combative, more presidential.”
“Members of the press contort themselves in an effort to find something positive they can say about Trump,” Molloy stresses, “and that often comes at the expense of accurately portraying what’s happening in the world. Instead of providing context for what is happening, these analysts find still frames completely detached from time and meaning from the Trump presidency.”
In March, Molloy notes, many journalists reported that Trump had adopted a “new tone” with the coronavirus pandemic — for example, the Associated Press reported, “After weeks of trying to play down the risk posed by the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump struck a more urgent tone Monday as he delivered a sobering message to Americans grappling with a new reality that will dramatically alter their lives for months to come.”
Journalists, Molloy argues, need to do more than “report on isolated moments of lucidity from the president” and should “take the extra step of providing basic context for what they’re reporting on.”
“Rather than churning out thousands of words about a shift in tone or a ‘pivot’ every few weeks with the same level of credulity they’d have afforded past presidents,” Molloy writes, “they need to understand that snapshot reporting like that only misinforms audiences and further erodes trust in the news media.”

0,2020-07-27T19:20:57+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/here-are-7-disturbing-revelations-from-a-national-guard-officer-about-trumps-lafayette-square-disaster/,Here are 7 disturbing revelations from a National Guard officer about Trump’s Lafayette Square disaster,"An officer in the D.C. National Guard delivered a damning account of the events surrounding the federal crackdown on protesters in Lafayette Square in testimony released by the House of Representatives on Monday.
Adam DeMarco, a senior officer tapped to serve as a liaison between the National Guard and the Park Police, was on the scene during the June 1 assault on protesters, as his opening statement for a planned hearing on Tuesday explained. While the president gave a speech to reporters at the White House, federal officers, including the Park Police, violently cleared demonstrators, the media, and others from the nearby area. Shortly thereafter, the president walked across the street that had been cleared for a photo-op at St. John’s Church.
Though presumably intended to bolster Trump’s political standing, the optics of the events clearly backfired, as Vanity Fair reported:
In the days that followed, Trump’s approval ratings tumbled to their lowest point in over a year, and their lowest point of the coronavirus pandemic, according to FiveThirtyEight’s poll tracker. The first two weeks of June also saw Trump fall even further behind his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. Before June, Biden steadily held a four-to-six-point lead over Trump in national polls, fueled in part by massive support among the independent voters whom Trump won in 2016. Shortly after Lafayette Square, though, Biden began to open up an even bigger lead, a nine-point average lead over the president, with a Washington Post–ABC News poll this week showing Biden winning by as many as 15 points.
Many Trump administration officials have tried to downplay the assault on protesters and dismiss the criticisms, but DeMarco’s account provides disturbing details about what was going on behind the scenes. His conclusion about the events is scathing:
Having served in a combat zone, and understanding how to assess threat environments, at no time did I feel threatened by the protestors or assess them to be violent. In addition, considering the principles of proportionality of force and the fundamental strategy of graduated responses specific to civil disturbance operations, it was my observation that the use of force against demonstrators in the clearing operation was an unnecessary escalation of the use of force. From my observation, those demonstrators – our fellow American citizens — were engaged in the peaceful expression of their First Amendment rights. Yet they were subjected to an unprovoked escalation and excessive use of force.
Here are seven key details from the statement.
1. DeMarco had no indication that protesters would be moved prior to 7 p.m., which was when the city’s curfew would be in place.
Defenders of the president, including Attorney General Bill Barr, have said that the protesters weren’t specifically cleared for the benefit of his photo-op. Instead, they said the purpose was to expand the perimeter around the White House. DeMarco confirms that there were plans to expand the perimeter, but he didn’t expect it to happen until nightfall:
I understood that a curfew imposed by the DC Mayor was not going into effect until 7:00 pm, so I was not expecting any clearing operation to commence before then.
…
At around 6:20 pm, after the Attorney General and General Milley departed Lafayette Square, the Park Police issued the first of three warning announcements to the demonstrators, directing them to disperse. I did not expect the announcements so early, as the curfew was not due to go into effect until 7:00 pm, 40 minutes later.
2. Federal officials didn’t even set up a new barrier until much later.
This fact suggests that DeMarco was correct to believe assume there was no plan to expand the perimeter until after the curfew was in place:
As for the new security barrier, whose installation was the stated purpose of the clearing operation, the materials to erect it did not arrive on the scene until around 9:00 pm, and it was not completed until later that night.
This supports the conclusion, as many critics of the president have argued, that the violent clearing of the square was for the purpose of his photo-op.
3. The warnings given to the protesters were entirely insufficient.
Some have defended the abuse of the protesters by claiming that they were defying the warnings of federal officials, who announced plans to clear the protesters. But DeMarco’s account confirms the reporting of journalists on the ground that these warnings were insufficient and inaudible:
The warnings were conveyed using a megaphone near the statue of President Jackson, approximately 50 yards from the demonstrators. From where I was standing, approximately 20 yards from the demonstrators, the announcements were barely audible and I saw no indication that the demonstrators were cognizant of the warnings to disperse.
4. As others who were on the scene have said, the protesters were peaceful.
Journalists on the ground have said that the protesters who were removed were behaving peacefully. There have been some who have claimed water bottles or possibly other objects were thrown by protesters at some point, but DeMarco did not report anything like this:
A few minutes before 6:00 pm, I was standing near the statue of Andrew Jackson in the middle of Lafayette Square as DC National Guard personnel formed up behind Park Police units positioned in a line behind the perimeter fence on the H Street side of the square, facing demonstrators on the other side of the fence. From what I could observe, the demonstrators were behaving peacefully, exercising their First Amendment rights.
…
General Milley walked towards the area where I was standing. As the senior National Guard officer on the scene at the time, I gave General Milley a quick briefing on our mission and the current situation. General Milley asked for an estimate of the number of demonstrators, and I estimated 2,000. General Milley told me to ensure that National Guard personnel remained calm, adding that we were there to respect the demonstrators’ First Amendment rights.
5. DeMarco provides direct evidence that CS tear gas was used by officials on the scene, despite repeated denials from the Trump administration.
I did not know what orders or rules of engagement had been issued to the Park Police concerning the use of force against the demonstrators. I asked my Park Police liaison if tear gas would be used because I had observed tear gas cannisters affixed to Park Police officers’ vests, and I knew that tear gas had been used against demonstrators the previous evening. The Park Police liaison told me that tear gas would not be employed.
…
As the clearing operation began, I heard explosions and saw smoke being used to disperse the protestors. The Park Police liaison officer told me that the explosions were “stage smoke,” and that no tear gas was being deployed against the demonstrators. But I could feel irritation in my eyes and nose, and based on my previous exposure to tear gas in my training at West Point and later in my Army training, I recognized that irritation as effects consistent with CS or “tear gas.” And later that evening, I found spent tear gas cannisters on the street nearby.
6. DeMarco described extreme and excessive violence being used against civilians.
From my vantage point, I saw demonstrators scattering and fleeing as the Civil Disturbance Unit charged toward them. I observed people fall to the ground as some Civil Disturbance Unit members used their shields offensively as weapons. As I walked behind the Civil Disturbance Units pushing westward on H Street, I also observed unidentified law enforcement personnel behind our National Guardsmen using “paintball-like” weapons to discharge what I later learned to be “pepper balls” into the crowd, as demonstrators continued to retreat.
7. Even DeMarco was unaware of all the federal agencies involved.
One emerging crisis from the Trump administration is the use of unnamed, unidentified federal officers with unclear jurisdiction or rules of operation. It’s disturbing that, in an operation in which DeMarco was involved as a senior National Guard officer, even he was unaware of the full range of federal agents present:
At approximately 6:30 pm, the Park Police began the clearing operation, led by Civil Disturbance Units and horse-mounted officers. The Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies I was unable to identify, also participated in the push. No National Guard personnel participated in the push or engaged in any other use of force against the demonstrators.

Bloomberg’s Amanda L. Gordon reports, “Solomon was on stage for an hour, just him and a turntable on an elevated platform, mask around neck, surrounded by animations of cherries and his deejay name, D-Sol, in flashing bubble letters. He put his hand up in the air, playing electronic dance beat takes on popular songs — not unlike the Chainsmokers, with more Fleetwood Mac than Coldplay. Giant plumes of smoke went up in front of the stage as the sky turned pink and orange.”
According to Gordon, the organizers of the show, In the Know Experiences, “seemed vigilant, with temperature checks and frequent announcements about wearing masks when moving around the venue. Still, there were clusters of friends dancing and mingling close together with masks off.” And TMZ reported that even though “precautions were in place,” there were “a heck of a lot of people in that area”— which, TMZ reported, “still looked a little dicey.”
Twitter users have been commenting on the amount of social distancing that was practiced at the show:

0,2020-07-27T18:28:42+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-how-joe-biden-will-pick-his-running-mate/,Here’s how Joe Biden will pick his running mate,"The New York Giants shocked the football world when they chose Joe Judge to be their new head coach. The decision was unusual because Judge had no prior head coaching experience and had never been the coordinator of an offense or a defense. He’d spent his career coaching special teams: kickoffs, punts, and field goals. Admittedly, he was considered very good at this, and had been part of many championships with Nick Saban’s University of Alabama team and Bill Belichick’s New England Patriots. But there wasn’t much precedent for hiring someone like Judge for such a high profile position. By all accounts, he won the job by knocking his interview out of the park.
Based on Ryan Lizza’s reporting for Politico, the interview process is also likely to determine who Joe Biden will choose for his running mate. None of the candidates check every box. Prospects who have run a national election, like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, are somewhat like football coaches who have losing records. Sure, they have relevant experience, but they haven’t proven they can win. Others are like coaching prospects who have specialized on only one side of the ball. A vice-presidential contender with experience in foreign affairs but little experience with domestic policy is a bit like a coach who has spent their whole career working on defense. Susan Rice might fit into this category. Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is more like the coach who is well-versed in offensive philosophy but has never worked on the defensive side of the ball. Tammy Duckworth is a more balanced choice who has both military and legislative experience, but she’s never been in an executive decision-making position. Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island has executive experience but would probably upset the fan base.
Raimondo would have some explaining to do for people on the left. She has had some nasty fights with unions in her state and during the Democratic primaries she endorsed Mike Bloomberg. But if she made it to a sit-down (or Zoom chat) with Biden, she’s the kind of person you could see winning him over with some shared reminiscing about their Irish and Italian ancestors feuding in places like Wilmington and Providence.
There are other considerations, too. Biden wants someone who is “simpatico” with his political outlook, and he wants someone loyal and focused more on being a partner than preparing for a future presidential run. Some of these factors may not be working in Kamala Harris’s favor:
When former Sen. Chris Dodd, a member of Joe Biden’s vice presidential search committee, recently asked Kamala Harris about her ambush on Biden in the first Democratic debate, Dodd was stunned by her response.
“She laughed and said, ‘that’s politics.’ She had no remorse,” Dodd told a longtime Biden supporter and donor, who relayed the exchange to POLITICO on condition of anonymity.
“Dodd felt it was a gimmick, that it was cheap,” the donor said. The person added that Dodd’s concerns about Harris were so deep that he’s helped elevate California Rep. Karen Bass during the vetting process, urging Biden to pick her because “she’s a loyal No. 2. And that’s what Biden really wants.”
Another consideration is simply to “do no harm” considering that Biden appears to be on a glide path to victory. Trump hasn’t been able to lay a glove on Biden, so he’ll be looking to pounce on his running mate.
The strategist said that Warren “checks the box of can-be-president tomorrow. The question for Elizabeth is whether it’s too much octane for the tank. Trump is desperately looking to turn Biden into a scary radical lefty. He can’t do that so his tactic is to make him seem like a tool of the scary radical left. She would become the nominee for president in the mind of Republicans. Trump will say, ‘Biden is so old that he won’t survive a year and she is going to be calling the shots and then she will be president.’”
A compelling case can be made against every known contender, which is all the more reason why the interview will probably be decisive. The Giants chose Joe Judge because he demonstrated the kind of leadership abilities they were looking for. He’s going to have a hard time succeeding at first because the COVID-19 crisis has cancelled all in-person practices and the entirety of the pre-season game schedule. The first time he sees his players in action, he’ll be coaching in a real game against the very experienced and stable Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday Night Football.  Yet, if the organization made the right choice, he’ll overcome these disadvantages and get the team winning again in short order. Joe Biden doesn’t have some proven winner like Vince Lombardi to choose from, but Lombardi didn’t have head coaching experience when the Green Bay Packers hired him.
Sometimes, you just have to do your research and go with what feels right. There’s a good chance that whoever Biden selects will be president someday, so even though I can’t give him any useful advice, I hope he makes a wise decision.

But on Thursday, July 23, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security moved to reinstate New York’s access to the program. And in a scathing editorial published on July 27, the Washington Post’s editorial board slams the Trump Administration for removing New York from the program — denouncing it as one of the Administration’s “most brazen recent acts of political retaliation.”
The Post states, “The New York Times reported the government admitted in court papers filed Thursday that Homeland Security officials had made false statements about their February decision to cut off New Yorkers from the trusted traveler program, which allows prescreened Americans expedited passage through border checks when reentering the United States from abroad.”
Trump’s allies, according to the Post’s editorial board, had one thing in mind when New York was cut off from the trusted traveler program: political revenge.
“The Trump Administration had justified the cutoff by pointing to New York’s new policy of refusing to disclose driver’s license information to federal immigration authorities absent a court order,” the Post’s editorial board notes. “The Administration claimed that the state’s policy was unusual and that federal officials, therefore, could not trust the state to cooperate in the background checks needed to screen New Yorkers for the trusted traveler program. In fact, government lawyers admitted Thursday, several other states and D.C. have similar policies — which are designed to shield undocumented immigrants who obtained driver’s licenses rather than encouraging them to drive illegally. But those states’ residents were not denied access to the trusted traveler program, showing that national security was not the underlying issue.”
The Post concludes its editorial by stressing that federal policy decisions should be based on the good of the country — not partisan politics.
“Once again, the Trump Administration appears to have been caught abusing its powers to further political or personal grudges,” the Post argues. “It is scary to imagine how much more of the same would occur if the president got another four years with his hands on the levers of government.”

Donald Trump has targeted a new pandemic villain: Dr. Anthony Fauci. Among his transgressions, the nation’s leading infectious disease physician relied on facts and science to contradict Trump’s talking points and criticize his policies. Even worse, he has outperformed Trump in public opinion polls.
So rather than declare war on a coronavirus outbreak that he has mismanaged at every turn, Trump has attacked Dr. Fauci and the truth.

Mar. 20: At a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing, a reporter asks Dr. Fauci if hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating the virus. “The answer is no,” he says, “and the evidence that you’re talking about…is anecdotal evidence.” A month later, the FDA cautions against using the drug because of dangerous and potentially fatal side effects. On June 15, the FDA revokes its temporary emergency use authorization as a COVID-19 treatment.
Mar. 21-Apr. 1: Dr. Fauci becomes what Politico calls a “fringe MAGA target” and by April 1 is receiving federal security protection.
Apr. 5: At a press briefing, Trump again touts hydroxychloroquine, repeatedly saying, “What do you have to lose?” When a reporter asks Dr. Fauci about the dangers of using the drug, Trump interrupts and refuses to let him answer.
April 8 Poll
Dr. Fauci’s COVID-19 approval rating
Overall: 78 percent
Republicans: 77 percent
Democrats: 81 percent
Independents: 79 percent
Trump’s COVID-19 approval rating: 46 percent
Round 2: Trump vs. Dr. Fauci on Reopening
Apr. 11-12: Trump spends much of Easter weekend on the phone asking informal advisers, “What do you think of Fauci?” Trump say that he has made Dr. Fauci a “star” by placing him at the center of the administration’s public response to COVID-19, including daily press briefings.
Apr. 12: Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Dr. Fauci says that a stronger early response by the Trump administration could have saved lives. Later that evening, Trump shares a tweet that includes this hashtag: #FireFauci.
Apr. 16-17: After threatening to force states to reopen before they have satisfied CDC guidelines for doing so safely, Trump tells governors that it’s their decision. The next day, Trump tweets, “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!”, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA” — all states planning not to reopen anytime soon.
Apr. 27: The White House Coronavirus Task Force holds its last public briefing for two months. When the next briefing occurs on June 26, Trump is not present.
Also at the end of April: WH Chief of Staff Mark Meadows starts banning Dr. Fauci from most television appearances.
May 8: Trump repeats what he has been saying regularly since February — that the virus would just “go away.”
May 11: Trump declares victory over COVID-19 and again urges states to reopen.
May 12: Appearing before the Senate, Dr. Fauci testifies to “really serious” consequences if states reopen businesses and schools too early. He warns that COVID-19 will not simply “disappear” and a second wave is “entirely conceivable and possible.” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) attacks Dr. Fauci, saying, “I don’t think you’re the end-all. I don’t think you’re the one person that gets to make a decision.”
Also on May 12: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson blasts Dr. Fauci as “the chief buffoon of the professional class.”
Mid-May: Trump stops receiving personal briefings from Dr. Fauci.
May 20 Poll
Dr. Fauci’s COVID-19 approval rating:
Overall: 68 percent (down from 78 percent in April)
Republicans: 51 percent (down from 77 percent)
Democrats: 86 percent (up from 81 percent)
Independents: 66 percent (down from 79 percent)
 Trump’s COVID-19 approval rating: 41 percent
  Round 3: Trump vs. Dr. Fauci — and the Horse He Rode In On
From early June to July 15: Trump does not speak with Dr. Fauci at all.
June 23: At a House hearing, Rep. David McKinley (R-WVA) asks Dr. Fauci if he regrets not advising the public more forcefully to wear masks earlier. “I don’t regret that because let me explain to you what happened,” Dr. Fauci answers. “At that time, there was a paucity of equipment that our healthcare providers needed, who put themselves daily in harm’s way of taking care of people who are ill. We did not want to divert masks and PPE away from them to be used by the people.”
July 12: A White House official releases a statement to several news outlets saying that “several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things.” It includes a lengthy list of Dr. Fauci’s comments from early in the outbreak and is presented in the style of a campaign’s opposition research document.
July 14: During a Fox News interview, Trump says, “[T]he same people that say wear a mask are people that said, a long time ago, don’t wear a mask, masks are bad. They said they’re not good. So, you know, like Dr. Fauci, surgeon general, a lot of people — a lot of people…”
July 14-15: In a USA Today op-ed that Trump reportedly authorized and encouraged (though the administration denied it), White House trade adviser Peter Navarro writes that Dr. Fauci “has been wrong on everything I have interacted with him on.” The next day, USA Today adds a note to the online version of the op-ed, noting that several of his claims “were misleading or lacked context. As such, Navarro’s op-ed did not meet USA TODAY’s fact-checking standards.”
July 15: Asked about Navarro’s op-ed, Trump says, “He made a statement representing himself. He shouldn’t be doing that.”
Also on July 15: Stephen Moore, a member of Trump’s task force on reopening the economy, tells USA Today that Moore and his team are preparing a memo that highlights Dr. Fauci’s record, claiming that he has been wrong in predicting the course of pandemics. “It’s time for him to go away,” Moore says.
Also on July 15: In a series of interviews with The Atlantic, Dr. Fauci describes the intensifying effort to discredit him as “bizarre.” “I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that.”
July 15 Poll
Voters who trust Dr. Fauci’s COVID-19 information
Overall: 65 percent (compared to 78 percent approval in April)
Republicans: 39 percent (compared to 77 percent approval in April)
Democrats: 86 percent (compared to 81 percent approval in April)
Independents: 67 percent (compared to 79 percent approval in April)
  Voters who trust Trump’s COVID-19 information:
Overall: 30 percent
Republicans: 71 percent
Democrats: 4 percent
Independents: 27 percent
July 17: In a Fox News interview airing on July 19, Trump calls Dr. Fauci “a little bit of an alarmist.” Trump also repeats the misleading claim that Dr. Fauci had opposed the public’s use of face masks before recommending them on April 3, omitting Dr. Fauci’s reasons: Widespread public demand for face masks would have diverted the limited supply of medical-grade masks away from hospital workers and first responders treating infected patients.
No Split Decision: The Longer Trump Wins, the More America Loses
So far, Trump is still losing his credibility war against Dr. Fauci. But as with past targets, Trump’s politicization playbook is working with some people. On April 8, Dr. Fauci’s overall approval rating was 78 percent. Today, only 65 percent trust him. However, the shift has been almost entirely among Republicans (77 percent approval in April down to only 39 percent who trust Dr. Fauci now) and, to a lesser extent, Independents (79 percent approval in April down to 67 percent who trust him today).
The pandemic, on the other hand, doesn’t respond to Trump’s talking points. On April 8, there were “only” 430,000 COVID-19 infections in the US and 15,000 deaths. Today almost four million infections in the US have resulted in more than 140,000 deaths. Based on current projections, more than 224,000 Americans will have died from the virus by November 1.
Millions remain out of work and the economy is in shambles. Banned from traveling to Europe, Canada and most of the world, where leaders have controlled the virus by following the very recommendations that Dr. Fauci is still urging, Americans have become international pariahs.
As Trump’s rhetoric persuades too many Americans to push back against masks, social distancing and necessary closings, infections surge to new heights. Hospitals are once again running out of ICU beds and personal protective equipment. Testing backlogs are once again delaying results for so long that they become useless in contact tracing and containment efforts. And saddest of all, refrigerated vans are once again serving as temporary morgues in communities where sickness and death are overwhelming.
In his war against Dr. Fauci, time is not on Trump’s side. Back on April 8, only 29 percent of respondents to Quinnipiac University’s poll had been infected with COVID-19 or knew someone personally who had. By July 15, that number had soared to 53 percent. Harsh reality is en route to many of Dr. Fauci’s new skeptics. When it hits closer to home, maybe they will trust him again. Perhaps they will heed his new warnings, follow his recommendations and become part of the COVID-19 solution.
“[A] risk for you is not just isolated to you.…[Y]ou have an individual responsibility to yourself. But you have a societal responsibility.…[T]his is part of a process that we can be either part of the solution or part of the problem.”
– Dr. Anthony Fauci, June 26, 2020

Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.
Early this election cycle, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn publicly worried about complacency within the Texas Republican political class — even after Democratic gains made in 2018.
So in early 2019, the state’s senior senator encouraged Texas Republicans in the U.S. House to bolster their fundraising and think twice about sending money out of the state.
“There’s an attempt by the leadership to extract as much money as possible out of the state as they can and use that wherever they need it, and I understand that,” he told The Texas Tribune in June 2019. “But we need to make sure our Texas races — from the president and all the way down to the courthouse — are adequately financed and resourced. And that’s going to require us to raise a significant amount of money.”
More than a year later, a Texas Tribune analysis of recent campaign finance reports shows that Cornyn’s fears of a funding problem have come to life. Democratic U.S. House candidates in Texas have millions more aggregate cash on hand than their Republican counterparts. It marks an extraordinary six-year shift within the Texas delegation.
In 2016, U.S. House Republican candidates in Texas had $32.3 million on hand in July of that year. Their Democratic counterparts reported $11.4 million.
The next cycle, boosted by a backlash to President Donald Trump, Democrats saw a jump in fundraising. In 2018, Texas Republican U.S. House candidates had $34.8 million in cash on hand, compared with $21.8 million on the Democratic side.
Newly filed campaign finance reports show a complete shift this year. Republicans running for the U.S. House in Texas reported $19.2 million. Democrats had $26.7 million.
In some races, the outsized financial reserves will amount to little, thanks to precisely drawn congressional lines intended to reinforce Republican incumbent protection. But for a Texas Democratic ecosystem that was effectively moribund only six years ago, the ways in which these Democratic candidates are raising and spending their campaign funds point to a more sophisticated — and optimistic — approach to the fall general election campaign.
The data for this analysis was pulled from July campaign finance reports from the second quarter of each election year that congressional seats are on the ballot. Those reports are among the most critical in the cycle. Unless candidates have to compete in a primary, most spend the first 18 months of a campaign cycle raising and stockpiling money. The second quarter reports often mark a high point in cash-on-hand sums before candidates drain it all during the fall television advertising season.
This new Democratic cash sloshing around the state is being spent on staff payroll, printing shops and even direct mail and polling — all of which could well make a Democratic presence known in otherwise ignored deeply GOP pockets of the state.
Impact down the ballot
The heart of the disparity exists in five U.S. House district races: The 7th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd and the 32nd.
Two are races with Democratic incumbents, U.S. Reps. Colin Allred of Dallas and Lizzie Pannill Fletcher of Houston. Each faces a serious Republican opponent — businesswoman Genevieve Collins is challenging Allred and veteran Wesley Hunt is against Pannill Fletcher. Both Republican candidates have about $1 million in cash on hand, indicating they are taking fundraising seriously. Collins has self-funded her campaign in part.
But the Democratic candidates spent their first terms fully leveraging their incumbencies: Allred reported $3 million, and Fletcher posted $3.5 million in cash on hand.
Elsewhere, Democratic candidates Sri Preston Kulkarni and Gina Ortiz Jones of the 22nd and 23rd districts, respectively, outperformed expectations when they ran for the same offices in 2018. That gave them a strong case to make to donors heading into 2020. They locked down their nominations in March and spent the spring and summer raising money while Republicans litigated expensive runoff contests.
In the 21st District, Democrat and former state Sen. Wendy Davis outraised freshman U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin, by a nearly 3-1 margin.
There are also outliers in the cash on hand on both sides.
For instance, freshman U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, has a growing national profile and reported $4 million on hand at the end of June.
Another freshman Republican, U.S. Rep. Michael Cloud of Victoria, represents a mostly noncompetitive conservative district in southeast Texas. He reported $344,000 in cash on hand, a sum that is on par with many incumbents of both parties. His Democratic rival, Ricardo De La Fuente, reported $1.1 million, almost all thanks to a candidate loan.
There is almost no chance Republican candidates in top-tier competitive races will be significantly short on money. And a Republican billionaire could still cut a seven-figure check to a GOP super PAC and reset the table in a U.S. House race overnight.
The conservative group Club for Growth indicated recently that it plans to spend at least $2.5 million supporting Roy in his race, for instance. Another super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, named Fletcher in the spring as one of their top targets and put $3 million in television spending behind that announcement.
Even so, candidate fundraising is still a foundational block to campaigns. Candidates secure lower ad rates than outside groups, which is particularly crucial in expensive media markets like the ones where these races are being litigated: Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio.
And the money affects more than just the seven or so competitive U.S. House races on the ballot.
Take the state’s 3rd Congressional District. Situated entirely in North Texas’ Collin County, it has been a longtime undisputed GOP stronghold. Mitt Romney won the district in 2012 with 64% of the vote to Barack Obama’s 34%. But in 2018, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, carried the county by only six percentage points, and U.S. Rep. Van Taylor of Plano saw the district’s margin narrow from 27 points in 2016 to 10 points during his first run for the seat in 2018.
Taylor took that race seriously, advertising on broadcast television, and he has over $1 million in cash on hand this year. His opponent, attorney Lulu Seikaly, only had about $40,000 on her last financial report, but the way she is spending that money is noteworthy. That same report revealed she had hired a national direct mail consultant. Additionally, her campaign said in a news release that it had raised $100,000 since the mid-July runoff and has had a well-regarded polling firm conduct an internal poll of the race.
Should a Democratic wave hit the state in the fall, Seikaly will already have poll-tested messaging and located vendors to potentially take advantage of the environment. If not, her efforts to bring Democrats in her district to the polls could still help others in her party above and below her on ballot. Taylor’s district overlaps considerably with that of state Rep. Jeff Leach, R-Plano, who is one of more than a dozen GOP incumbents Democrats are targeting in an effort to flip the state House.
Beyond the candidate fundraising, millions more in Democratic dollars will pound the state. The national parties and aligned super PACs are postured to dump tens of millions of dollars into the targeted U.S. House races, the fight for the state House and, potentially, the Senate race. Republicans are expected to respond in kind but the difference is, before 2018, these Democratic groups mostly ignored the state, save for the Texas 23rd Congressional District in west Texas.
This year, the spending will be in every major media market.
Multiple factors
The reasons for the deficit are more complicated than mere complacency on the Republican side.
A handful of Republican members who hold top committee positions or are running for those slots — U.S. Reps. Kevin Brady of the Woodlands, Michael Burgess of Lewisville and Kay Granger of Fort Worth — have transferred significant portions of their campaign funds to the House GOP campaign arm to bolster their support among House members.
And about a year ago, some of the biggest Republican fundraisers in the delegation announced their retirements. There was U.S. Rep. Will Hurd of Helotes, who raised millions each year for his inevitably difficult reelection campaign each fall. There were also U.S. Reps. Mac Thornberry of Clarendon, Bill Flores of Bryan, Pete Olson of Sugar Land, Kenny Marchant of Coppell and Mike Conaway of Midland. All had leadership roles or choice committee assignments and with that, obligations to raise money for colleagues.
In most retirements, incumbents spend their last year or so in office cutting back on fundraising and political activity. The candidates who replace them on the ballot raised and spent big money in their primaries and are only now turning to the general election. Some of those Republican candidates are all but certain to come to Congress, but others will face formidable Democrats in the fall.
There are also currently three fewer Republican members than there were in the past two cycles at this point. Two Republican members lost re-election last cycle and another seat, the 4th District, is in the process of choosing nominees for a special election to succeed former U.S. Rep. John Ratcliffe, who is now serving as the director of National Intelligence.
Also, the biggest difference between 2018 and 2020 is that the GOP no longer holds a majority in the U.S. House, and it is a law of political gravity that the party with the gavel has a much easier time raising money.
Additionally, numerous Texas Republicans noted, several of the primary races to replace retiring GOP members were only decided two weeks ago in a later-than-usual runoff. It makes sense, they argue, that so many of their candidates are broke. But now that the general election here, they will benefit from a burst of fundraising. Democrats counter that logic by noting that several of their own House candidates, too, faced financially exhausting runoffs.
Even so, the disparity bothers some national Republicans who are increasingly worried about resources across the map and particularly in Texas.
For his part, Cornyn is a source of stability within the Republican slate. He reported $14.5 million in cash on hand on June 30 and has raised $22.4 million over the course of this cycle. By comparison, his Democratic competitor, MJ Hegar, had about $900,000 and likely depleted that sum in the final weeks of her runoff against state Sen. Royce West of Dallas.
Since Hegar clinched the nomination, her campaign touted raising $1 million in the first week after the runoff. Republicans who care about this race are closely watching her progress with worry, as they see Democratic Senate candidates in other states catch national fundraising interest and bank tens of millions of dollars a quarter.
Cornyn is a former chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a post in which he oversaw the raising and spending of hundreds of millions of dollars to elect Republicans to the Senate in the 2010 and 2012 cycles.
And that makes his 2019 comments about raising and keeping money back home all the more remarkable. Cornyn, like most Texans dating back to Lyndon B. Johnson, climbed the ranks of Capitol Hill by directing Texas money to colleagues elsewhere in the country.
But this cycle, he is telegraphing that the best service he and other Texas Republicans can be to his party is to take care of business back home.
“We are, I think, no longer the reliably red state we have been,” he said in 2019. “We are at risk of turning purple; and if we don’t do our job, then we could well turn blue in the coming years.”

Trump’s plummeting poll numbers have often been cited as a key reason for his change in tone, but here’s another one: many of the Sun Belt surges are occurring in either red states such as Texas and Georgia or swing states with Republican governors (Florida and Arizona, for example). And Trump is expressing a level of concern that he wasn’t expressing when the pandemic was killing so many Americans in blue states and blue cities.
Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker, in a July 27 article for the Washington Post, examine the toll that Trump’s response to the pandemic has been taking on his reelection campaign. And the article discusses the abundance of dangerous COVID-19 increases in states with a lot of Trump supporters.
“In the past couple of weeks,” Parker and Rucker report, “senior advisers began presenting Trump with maps and data showing spikes in coronavirus cases among ‘our people’ in Republican states, a senior administration official said. They also shared projections predicting that virus surges could soon hit politically important states in the Midwest — including Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, the official said. This new approach seemed to resonate, as he hewed closely to pre-scripted remarks in a trio of coronavirus briefings last week.”
The reporters explain, “Trump’s shortcomings have perplexed even some of his most loyal allies, who increasingly have wondered why the president has not at least pantomimed a sense of command over the crisis or conveyed compassion for the millions of Americans impacted by it.”
Hence the brief, fleeting “shift in tone”

For months, much of the carnage with COVID-19 was occurring in blue states or blue cities. New York City, during the spring, was the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States; thousands died in NYC. And New Jersey, a blue state that sometimes elects Republican governors, was hit hard. But COVID-19 was never a “blue state illness” that didn’t pose a threat to red states. It is a global crisis, and that crisis has recently hit the Sun Belt in a major way. NYC has flattened the curve, while Sun Belt cities are seeing their hospitals and medical systems overwhelmed.
Looking at a map of COVID-19 infections published with Parker and Rucker’s article, it’s evident that many of the Sun Belt hotspots are states Trump will need to win if he is going to be reelected. That includes Florida (a swing state), some light red states (Texas and Georgia) and some deep red states such as South Carolina, Mississippi and Alabama.
And it’s not “our people” individually he cares about. There are Republican voters in every single state with a Democratic governor or majority. It’s only “our people” as a majority of a state that can deliver electoral votes. It’s never about people, only about Trump.

With COVID-19 ravaging so many Sun Belt states Trump is hoping to win, he is suddenly emphasizing how dangerous the pandemic is — after months of encouraging states to ease their social distancing restrictions as soon as possible.
Trump’s policy decisions have often been affected by his desire to pander to his red state base — not a concern for the greater good of the United States. And sadly, the coronavirus pandemic is no different.

0,2020-07-27T15:13:50+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/from-perfect-storm-to-a-tsunami-cook-political-report-expert-details-how-trump-is-dragging-down-senate-republicans/,From ‘perfect storm’ to ‘a tsunami’: Cook Political Report expert details how Trump is dragging down Senate Republicans,"Cook Political Report expert Jessica Taylor explained to MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle that President Donald Trump is such a drag on the ticket that all of the mistakes Republican senators have made are proving to be damaging to their November chances.
Taylor noted that the Senate seats in Minnesota and New Mexico were moved to the “safe” category. However, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) and appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) have been moved from “leaning Republican” to being a “toss-up.”
Loeffler has waged a war against the WNBA saying that Black players and their allies have no business participating in the nationwide effort Black Lives Matter. Loeffler claimed the movement threatens “to destroy” America. It generally isn’t a smart political move to alienate a huge number of your state ahead of an election, but Loeffler was already on thin ice after being accused of insider trading because she dumped stocks shortly after a closed-door meeting about the coronavirus. She then called it “socialist” to criticize her. Senate Republicans have dropped the ethics investigation as has Trump’s Justice Department, meaning a new Justice Department could relaunch the investigation if Trump loses in November. She’s already loaned her campaign $10 million, desperately trying to beat Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) and two Democratic opponents she is trailing.
Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) is in a difficult position after making it clear she didn’t take Trump’s impeachment seriously. She was then caught on tape saying she wanted to kill Medicare. But on the ground, Ernst keeps failing at very basic campaigning. The Iowa Starting Line explained went down in flames during an interview where she was asked basic questions about policies and political goals.
“The most newsworthy moment that came from the taping with a trio of top Iowa reporters was Ernst admitting that she would back a lame-duck Supreme Court nomination at the end of this year, even if President Donald Trump was defeated and even if Senate Republicans lost their majority,” the site wrote.
It flies in the face of what Ernst said in 2016 when she argued, “We must wait to see what the people say this November.” But it wasn’t the position, the site said, that was terrible so much as her excuse for it.
The Joni Ernst SCOTUS comments are much more stunning in the actual video. Watch the 2 minutes. Ernst’s reasoning for a lame-duck confirmation is simply that Republicans control the White House and Senate pic.twitter.com/scuuphSEXx
— Iowa Starting Line (@IAStartingLine) July 17, 2020
It only added to an “inept” description of her health care position, “or lack thereof,” the site explained.
“So, what has happened over the past year and increasingly over the past four months since this pandemic began is that Democrats have expanded the map by putting states like that in play along with Montana, and we now have six seats that are in our tossup category, Colorado, North Carolina, Maine, Iowa, Georgia and Montana,” Taylor told Ruhle. “And then we also see Martha McSally there in Arizona, who was appointed to the seat, she lost on the election, just two years ago, for the seat, and her numbers have not improved there. She is losing consistently to Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, husband of Gabrielle Giffords and that’s a seat in play at the presidential level. These states are just racking up for possibilities for Democrats. And at this point, there are multiple paths to the three seats that they need and that I think of it as four seats probably that they’re going to need, because the most vulnerable incumbent is Doug Jones in Alabama, and we project that one as a probable loss for Democrats, but everywhere else they are playing offense where Republicans are very much on defense.”
She explained it is a combination of things that are leading Democrats to victory.
“Four months ago one Republican strategist said to me this was sort of the perfect storm against them,” Taylor recalled. “Now it is becoming a perfect tsunami that could really wipe out the Senate and Republicans increasingly see this as their last firewall. If the polls stand and Joe Biden defeats President Trump, we at the Cook Political Report, my colleague Dave Wasserman believes that Democrats could possibly grow the House majority they won back last cycle, then this Senate would be the last sort of remaining piece that would stop Democrats from having unified control and I think that’s a message we will increasingly hear them say.”
She noted that it’s clear Trump hasn’t handled any of the crises well and his poll numbers are dragging GOP incumbents down in many states.

Tom Cotton pushing Senate legislation to penalize schools for using a curriculum based on the 1619 Project. Hannah-Jones spearheaded the project, which “seeks to place the enslavement of Africans at the center of America’s story, prompting public conversation about the nation’s founding and evolution,” as the project was described when she won the Pulitzer Prize for her essay.
”The 1619 Project is left-wing propaganda. It’s revisionist history at its worst,” Cotton told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Cotton’s view? “We have to study the history of slavery and its role and impact on the development of our country because otherwise we can’t understand our country. As the Founding Fathers said, it was the necessary evil upon which the union was built, but the union was built in a way, as Lincoln said, to put slavery on the course to its ultimate extinction.”
So … it’s left-wing propaganda for Hannah-Jones to put slavery and its legacy at the center of U.S. history, but the Founding Fathers saw slavery as “the necessary evil upon which the union was built.” If it was a necessary evil according to the people who defined the basis of the nation, then yeah, it’s necessary to put slavery at the center of our history.
Cotton said he rejects, “root and branch,” the idea “that America is at root, a systemically racist country to the core and irredeemable.” But again, he really took that “necessary evil” thing and ran with it.
Hannah-Jones challenged Cotton, asking “Were the Founders right or wrong, @TomCottonAR, when they called slavery a ‘necessary evil upon which the Union was built’? Because either you agree with their assessment of slavery as necessary or you admit they were lying and it was just an evil and dishonorable choice. Which?”
Cotton’s is an attempt to counter a status quo history curriculum that has its own politics.
“The way that history is taught in American schools is highly politicized and it really has a nationalistic agenda,” Hannah-Jones recently told WBUR. “What that has meant is that it has necessarily downplayed the role of slavery.”
School districts including Chicago, Washington, and Buffalo are adopting the 1619 Project curriculum, and Cotton sees this as his chance to elevate himself in the Trumpian culture wars, sending a strong message that he intends to continue sidelining Black people in U.S. history—and, onlookers can infer, in other ways.

Taking issue with fellow Never-Trumper Matt Lewis, who writes for the Daily Beast and pinned the blame for the state of the nation on Trump but warned against making wholesale changes by replacing GOP senators, Sykes wrote ousting Trump is not enough.
“Let’s leave aside the question of whether the deaths of nearly 150,000 Americans can be considered a ‘lethal’ consequence,” of back Trump,” Sykes wrote, “Lewis is among the anti-Trump critics now warning against punishing the GOP too severely for its cowardice, lack of character, and submission to Trumpism.”
Asking, “Can you defeat Trumpism by defeating Trump but leaving his bootlickers in power?” Sykes was blunt in answering his own question.
“The transactional nature of the Senate GOP’s groveling surrender to Trump is straightforward: Simply ignore his awfulness and you will get things you want. That bargain required ignoring an ever-growing pile of awfulness. At some point the ignorance morphed into rationalization and ultimately active collaboration,” he wrote before singling out Republican Senators Lindsey Graham (SC), Kelly Loeffler (GA), John Cornyn (TX), Martha McSally (AZ), Thom Tillis (NC), Mitch McConnell (KY), Cory Gardner (CO), Marsha Blackburn (TN) and Joni Ernst (IA).
Pointing out, “Some have simply fallen silent, while others have turned themselves into low-rent internet trolls,” Sykes added, “… they have squandered their credibility. Only the profoundly naïve can imagine a John Cornyn making a credible case against executive overreach; or Kelly Loeffler for ethics in government; or Lindsey Graham defending the rule of law. Which Senate Republican would not be laughed off the stage if he or she attempted to warn now against the dangers of an exploding national debt?” Sykes admitted that their replacements may not be better, but that was beside the point if traditional Republicans wish to remain a viable political force.
“If the GOP does not somehow renew itself—by purging the foul air of its current corruption—it will find itself in the wilderness for the next 40 years as it tries to explain its history of Vichy Trumpism,” he wrote before praising Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) and “smart, principled, competent Republican governors like Larry Hogan (MD), Charlie Baker (MA) and Phil Scott (VT)” for being shining lights during the pandemic disaster under Donald Trump.
“As for the rest of them,” he wrote, “Burn it all down.”

0,2020-07-27T13:37:58+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-own-labor-department-is-warning-congress-that-the-gops-unemployment-benefit-plan-is-nearly-impossible-to-implement/,Trump’s own Labor Department is warning Congress that the GOP’s unemployment benefit plan is nearly impossible to implement,"A Republican proposal to pare back enhanced unemployment benefits to about 70% of what a worker earned prior to losing their job—as opposed to the previous weekly payment of $600 across the board—would take most states between two to five months to implement, likely causing delays in relief for tens of millions of people.
That’s according to a memo (pdf) presented to Congress last week by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA), an organization representing state agencies that administer unemployment benefits and other programs.
The memo, obtained by NPR over the weekend, warned that replacing the flat weekly payment with a more complicated individualized benefit based on prior income “would take 8 to 20 weeks or more” for most states to fully implement, depending on the formula the White House and GOP ultimately propose.
Such an implementation delay “could mean a huge gap in payments and a bigger backlog for millions,” noted NPR correspondent Kelsey Snell.
As NPR reported Saturday, “the potential delays are so significant that the U.S. Department of Labor told Congress in May that it ‘strongly’ opposed such a change because states would find it ‘exceedingly difficult if not impossible to implement.'”
The Labor Department, according to a document obtained by NPR, told the House Ways and Means Committee that “states would find it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible to implement a unique payment amount in addition to the various benefit payments to which the [Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation] applies.”
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the architects of the $600-per-week benefit provided under the CARES Act, tweeted Saturday that “you know Republicans are in pretty bad shape when they have to go with a plan based on rough ideas that Donald Trump’s own Secretary of Labor says are unworkable.”

The last weekly unemployment check with the flat $600 boost went out in 49 states on Saturday and in New York on Sunday as Congress failed to approve an extension before leaving town for the weekend. Unemployment benefits are set to revert to pre-pandemic levels starting August 1 if Congress does not act.
With tens of millions of Americans facing a massive drop in income in mere days, White House officials on Sunday floated the possibility of quickly passing a narrow bill extending boosted unemployment benefits and granting liability protections to corporations, a top priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the business lobby.
“Honestly I see us being able to provide unemployment insurance, maybe a retention credit to keep people from being displaced or brought back into the workplace, helping with our schools—if we can do that along with liability protections perhaps we put that forward, get that passed as we negotiate on the rest of the bill in the weeks to come,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said in an interview Sunday on ABC.
McConnell is expected to unveil the GOP’s full coronavirus stimulus package on Monday after delaying release of the legislation due to intraparty disagreements over unemployment benefits and other key issues.
The Washington Post reported Sunday that instead of simply extending the $600-per-week boost in unemployment benefits, Republicans have “discussed a formula that would amount to 70 percent wage replacement of the salary a worker was getting paid before getting laid off.”
“Some economists say the new formula would effectively take the $600 weekly payment to around $200 a week,” the Post noted, “though [Treasury Secretary Steve] Mnuchin stressed on Sunday it would vary from person to person.”
Josh Bivens, research director for the Economic Policy Institute, estimates that reducing the enhanced unemployment payments to $200 per week would cost the United States 3.4 million jobs over the next year.
In a series of tweets on Friday, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) warned that “the damage from a lapse in unemployment benefits will radiate throughout the economy.”
“Any future extension will come too late to help those who are evicted, who lose their jobs, businesses, or health coverage, and those who go hungry,” said Beyer. “This is a dark moment for our country.”

Trump: Yale psychiatrist explains what the media missed in Mary Trump’s book,"This article was paid for by Raw Story subscribers. Not a subscriber? Try us and go ad-free for $1. Prefer to give a one-time tip? Click here.
The publication of Dr. Mary Trump’s new book, Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man, has brought new attention to the mental health of Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States. Much of Dr. Trump’s narrative matches the analysis of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President, edited by DCReport contributor Bandy X. Lee, a Yale forensic psychiatrist.
With the two books, an independent public health analysis has met with intimate household experience to produce an evaluation by experts that could not be more thorough.  But, until now, no one was making a connection. So Dr. Lee decided to interview Dr. Edwin Fisher, a clinical psychologist and a professor in the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Fisher is the author of a chapter on presidential fitness for The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump.
Lee: Our country is literally dying for the lack of access to expertise.  Yet, for all the talk that Dr. Mary Trump has generated, no one seems to be drawing on her actual expertise to ask, what does it mean to have “the world’s most dangerous man” in the White House?  What is the standard response to a dangerous person?  No one is interviewing experts about her work.  How do you explain this?
Fisher: Many years ago, Harvard psychologist David McClelland showed that individuals who actually are high-achieving are quick to call on expertise—they don’t go down in flames trying to prove their prowess in areas in which they lack skill.  Rather, they are quick to call on expertise to move their projects forward.
Dr. Mary Trump’s book details how “I alone can fix it” is a statement 70 years in the making, not an odd choice of words in a single speech.  Donald Trump’s bravado requires the diminishment of all others, including experts.  Marginalizing Drs. Fauci, Birx, and Redfield, he creates space for his own position as in the new CDC guidelines that prioritize opening schools over the safety of the students, teachers, and staff within them.
Add to this crude self-interest.  The financial markets and tax cuts have been very good to those with “deep pockets” to spend on political campaigns.  At the same time, having come to depend on government grants and industry contracts for their well-being causes many organizations to balk at taking on the most powerful individual on earth.  This has included, for example, the American Psychiatric Association that has vigorously discouraged discussion of the President’s psychological state.
What most impressed me was the utter coldness of the Trump family.
As a clinical psychologist, what did you think of her analysis, and did anything surprise you?
What most impressed me was the utter coldness of the Trump family.  Examples cascade across the pages.  Fred Trump, the president’s father, told his daughter after her mother had been rushed to the hospital, “They told me your mother won’t make it through the night” and then, “Go to school tomorrow.  I’ll call you if there’s any change.”
Donald’s grandfather died of the Spanish flu in 1918 when Fred was only 12.  Mary describes Fred’s reaction, years later, when discussing it: “Then he died. Just like that.  It just didn’t seem real.  I wasn’t that upset.  You know how kids are.  But I got upset watching my mother crying.”
The erasure seems to have been passed on, father to son.  Shameless in seizing any observation that might provide an advantage, it is surprising that Donald has not used the cause of his grandfather’s death as a prop for his own credibility regarding COVID, instead insisting, “I didn’t know people died from the flu.”
What is your opinion of her assessment that he is mentally “incapable” of leading?
Through the many details in the book, one comes to realize a colossal emptiness of the Trump family.  Fred cared only about money and others to the extent they could help him get it.  Donald seems to care only about acclaim and feeling powerful, both symbolized by money but how thinly, given multiple bankruptcies.  Most clear in this, Mary’s father, Freddy, enjoyed boating and fishing with his friends and became a successful TWA pilot, flying a prestigious Boston-Los Angeles route, but his father had nothing but scorn for these interests not related to Trump Enterprises.
Raised in such a vacuum of connection, it is no wonder our President shows such disinterest in the millions who depend on his concern.
The emptiness extended to the banal.  Mary’s mother received an expensive handbag from Ivana one year, evidently regifted judging by its content, a used Kleenex.  Raised in such a vacuum of connection, it is no wonder our President shows such disinterest in the millions who depend on his concern.
You were among the first to come forward to say that the president was “dangerous”, when few laypersons were ready to utter that word.  How does it feel to have been so right, and what would you do differently if you could go back?
It is an intriguing history, I think, of how our articulating the President’s dangerousness influenced the public’s perceptions and, perhaps, its actions.  My sense was that we said, put a name on, what everybody knew.  It was apparent in his descent on the escalator to name-call folks from Mexico, in his bragging to a much younger colleague about grabbing women, and in his stalking Hillary Clinton on the stage of one of the presidential debates.  We pointed to it and said, “yes,” this is something, it’s real, and it’s a problem.
There is very little Trump would not do to salvage his bloated but ever so fragile pride.
We failed to provoke action strong enough to remove his ability to kill millions, but I suspect the awareness to which we contributed has restricted him in ways we may never know.  Perhaps, for example, encouraged by our and many other mental health professionals’ work, generals and leaders in the Defense Department were a bit more assertive than they might have been, perhaps those advising him on foreign policy were a bit more aware of the danger they confronted.
What frustrates is the message not conveyed.  As much as many recognize the President’s dangerousness, most fail to grasp how dangerous.  This may be changing as, facing realities he cannot bluster away, his flailing becomes more pronounced.  Dr. Mary Trump’s articulation of the profound emptiness of her uncle tells me there is very little he would not do to salvage his bloated but ever so fragile pride.  It is crucial that those who can restrain him act now or be prepared to do so.  Not only our democracy as so many have said, but our lives may depend on it.

0,2020-07-27T13:07:43+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-pathological-unwillingness-to-admit-error-is-a-key-reason-why-his-campaign-is-facing-the-abyss-report/,Trump’s ‘pathological unwillingness to admit error’ is a key reason why his campaign is ‘facing the abyss’: report,"A long list of U.S. presidents have shown the ability to admit it when they made an obvious mistake, but not President Donald Trump — who has insisted on painting himself as infallible. And that inability to acknowledge mistakes, according to Washington Post reporters Ashley Parker and Philip Rucker, has done a lot to make Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic so flawed and problematic.
In an article published on July 27, Parker and Rucker stress that coronavirus — more than any other issue — is hurting Trump’s reelection campaign. The Post’s Glenn Kessler, on Twitter, cited Trump’s inability to admit to errors as the thing in the article that best explains why his campaign and the U.S. in general are “facing the abyss”:
Parker and Rucker report, “People close to Trump, many speaking anonymously to share candid discussions and impressions, say the president’s inability to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic.”
According to Parker and Rucker, Trump’s advisers and his political opponents agree on “one thing: the best way for him to regain his political footing is to wrest control of the coronavirus.”
“Both allies and opponents agree he has failed at the one task that could help him achieve all of his goals: confronting the pandemic with a clear strategy and consistent leadership,” Parker and Rucker explain. “Trump’s shortcomings have perplexed even some of his most loyal allies, who increasingly have wondered why the president has not at least pantomimed a sense of command over the crisis or conveyed compassion for the millions of Americans impacted by it.”
The Post reporters note that recently — with more than 146,000 U.S. residents having died from COVID-19 — the Trump Administration “has attempted to overhaul, or at least rejigger, its approach” and “has revived news briefings led by Trump himself and presented the president with projections showing how the virus is now decimating Republican states full of Trump voters. Officials have also set up a separate, smaller coronavirus working group led by Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, along with Trump son-in-law and Senior Adviser Jared Kushner.”
However, they add, “the question is why Trump did not adjust sooner, realizing that the path to nearly all of his goals — from an economic recovery to an electoral victory in November — runs directly through a healthy nation in control of the virus.”
Ben Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama, told the Post that Trump’s campaign would be in much better shape if he had stayed on top of the coronavirus crisis.
“The irony is that if he’d just performed with minimal competence and just mouthed words about national unity, he actually could be in a pretty strong position right now — where the economy is reopening, where jobs are coming back,” Rhodes argued. “And he just could not do it.”
Republican Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director in the Trump Administration in 2017 but is now an outspoken Trump critic, explained that humility has never been Trump’s approach — even when it would be to his benefit.
Scaramucci told the Post, “His operating style is to double and triple down on positions and to never, ever admit he’s wrong about anything. His 50-year track record is to bulldog through whatever he’s doing, whether it’s Atlantic City, which was a failure, or the Plaza Hotel, which was a failure, or Eastern Airlines, which was a failure. He can never just say, ‘I got it wrong, and let’s try over again.’”

But since Dr. Anthony Fauci was getting so much good press in anticipation of his season-opening foray to the mound in Washington, Trump was clearly jealous, and no doubt pleased to learn there would be no crowd in Yankee Stadium to boo him. But then Fauci got ribbed mercilessly in the press for his wild pitch, and Trump was perhaps reminded that he might not be able to do much better. So over the weekend he announced to the nation that he was just too busy.
Because of my strong focus on the China Virus, including scheduled meetings on Vaccines, our economy and much else, I won’t be able to be in New York to throw out the opening pitch for the @Yankees on August 15th. We will make it later in the season!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2020
Our very busy president played golf on Saturday, and spent most of Sunday retweeting images of his paramilitary raid on Portland, rando sh**posters and conspiracy theories. He even retweeted a whiny lament about the greatness of hydroxychloroquine, a golden oldie at this point. So I’m sure the country feels much relieved by Trump’s “new tone” that the media keeps going on about, and no doubt the catastrophic collapse of his already tepid poll numbers will reverse itself immediately.
Meanwhile COVID-19 continues to ravage the nation and no matter how hard new campaign manager Bill Stepien and the rest of his team try to get him to take it seriously, Trump is simply unable to do it. He reluctantly had to cancel his convention extravaganza in Jacksonville — which had been moved from Charlotte at his insistence — mainly because even Republican diehards didn’t want to travel into the epicenter of America’s massive surge in cases.
Trump’s fatuous spin that this was another of his “strong” decisions to keep the country safe at all costs fell flat since there are endless clips of him expressing disdain for anyone who thought that staging a crowded political convention in the middle of a raging pandemic might not be a great idea. He has never demonstrated interest in keeping the country safe from this pandemic. He just wants to keep “his numbers” down, and that’s not the same thing.
This news had to hit Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, especially hard. He had lobbied hard for the convention when Trump had his temper tantrum last month over North Carolina’s refusal to guarantee that his fans would be able to attend speeches in the indoor event center without wearing masks or practicing social distancing. DeSantis was more than happy to guarantee the Trumpers a good time without all those unpleasant COVID guidelines. But even then the clock was ticking on Florida’s exploding caseload.
If you want to see the perfect realization of the Trump administration’s pandemic policy, look to Florida. It is certainly true that the virus has surged in a number of other states, including Texas, Arizona and California. The first two, like Florida, were driven to open too rapidly by Republican governors, while California’s surge seems to be linked to general overconfidence — people failed to observe safe guidelines once the lockdown orders were lifted. Florida isn’t alone in this surge and it won’t be the last state to experience one.
But only in Florida did the governor appear on TV and have a full-blown Trumpian whine-fest in May because he wasn’t getting enough credit for keeping cases lower in Florida than New York:
DeSantis spoke too soon and opened his state much too fast. Florida is now the one of the global epicenters of this virus and it’s not getting better anytime soon. Every day since July 10 the state has averaged more than 10,000 new cases per day. According to the New York Times, the state has had 423,800 cases and 5,854 deaths from the virus so far.
DeSantis spoke too soon and opened his state much too fast. Florida is now the one of the global epicenters of this virus and it’s not getting better anytime soon. Every day since July 10 the state has averaged more than 10,000 new cases per day. According to the New York Times, the state has had 423,800 cases and 5,854 deaths from the virus so far.
As the virus spread out of control in Florida, decision-making became increasingly shaped by politics and divorced from scientific evidence, according to interviews with 64 current and former state and administration officials, health administrators, epidemiologists, political operatives and hospital executives. The crisis in Florida, these observers say, has revealed the shortcomings of a response built on shifting metrics, influenced by a small group of advisers and tethered at every stage to the Trump administration, which has no unified plan for addressing the national health emergency but has pushed for states to reopen.
When DeSantis insisted on reopening Florida’s economy early, Trump cheered him on. In fact, the Post reports that Trump gleefully told advisers that Florida’s supposed success gave other states the validation to open prematurely as well. DeSantis returned the favor by backing Trump’s play all the way, refusing to enact measures like mask-wearing that might have helped mitigate the surge. The Post reports that Trump administration officials “regularly sent reports and clips of DeSantis bragging about Florida not having cases early in the outbreak, to argue that many states were overreacting and, at times, that seasonal heat could cure the virus.”
Like his hero and mentor, DeSantis can’t find time to talk to his experts but does have time to talk to Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, which he has done numerous times as the virus has exploded in his state.
DeSantis was a backbench congressman who won the 2018 gubernatorial election largely because of Trump’s endorsement and he’s been a loyal henchman from the beginning. It was assumed all along that he could help deliver Florida to Trump this November and that his future might well include an address on Pennsylvania Avenue. (Yes, he is that ambitious.)
But lashing himself to the Trump Train was a risky move from the outset, and it doesn’t look like it’s paying off. The latest Quinnipiac poll has Biden leading Trump by 13 points in the Sunshine State, 51% to 38%. DeSantis isn’t doing any better. In April, 50% of Florida voters approved of his handling of the pandemic. That’s now down to 38%, the same number who back Trump’s re-election.
Florida elected a mini-Trump in 2018 and got a Trump mega-disaster in 2020. Now the whole country is paying the price.

0,2020-07-27T12:31:48+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/study-predicts-polar-bears-will-die-off-within-80-years-the-poster-child-for-climate-change/,Study predicts polar bears will die off within 80 years: ‘The poster child for climate change’,"Polar bears could face extinction by the end of the century as a result of shrinking sea ice in the Arctic caused by climate change, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Though the study did not predict all polar bears would go extinct entirely by 2100, it estimated that 13 of 19 Arctic polar bear subpopulations, which make up roughly 80% of the species, are likely to die off due to starvation and reproductive failure. The researchers said the estimate was “probably conservative” based on the current rate of ice loss and predicted some subpopulations would go extinct even sooner.
“There is very little chance that polar bears would persist anywhere in the world, except perhaps in the very high Arctic in one small subpopulation” if global temperatures continue to rise at the current level, Peter Molnar, a professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough and the lead author of the study, told The New York Times. Even if emissions are moderately reduced in line with the Paris Climate Accord “we still are unfortunately going to lose some, especially some of the southernmost populations, to sea-ice loss,” he said.
The shrinking sea ice is forcing polar bears to move onto land, which leaves them further from their food supply for extended periods, the study said. The longer “fasting season” and declining reproduction “will jeopardize the persistence of all but a few high-Arctic subpopulations by 2100,” the study said. “Moderate emissions mitigation prolongs persistence but is unlikely to prevent some subpopulation” extinction.
“Previously, we knew that polar bears would ultimately disappear unless we halt greenhouse gas rise. But knowing when they will begin to disappear in different areas is critical for informing management and policy — and inspiring action,” Steven Amstrup, the chief scientist at Polar Bears International and co-author of the study, said in a statement. “We found that moderate emissions reductions may prolong global persistence, but are not likely to prevent the extirpation of several populations, emphasizing the urgency of more ambitious emissions cuts.”
There are around 25,000 polar bears living in the Arctic. They primarily live on sea ice so they can hunt seals. But because of melting ice, more bears are being forced onto land during the spring and summer. Ice during summer months has declined at an average rate of 13% per decade since 1980, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Many parts that previously had ice all year now have no ice during the summer months.
“You need the sea ice to capture your food,” Molnar said. “There’s not enough food on land to sustain a polar bear population.”
Polar bears can fast for months, but the rate of the melting ice suggests that they will soon be forced onto land for longer periods — meaning they will have to fast longer than they are capable.
“Land-based feeding is unlikely to occur at scales that shift the timelines for recruitment and survival declines by more than a few years, because foods that meet the energy demands of polar bears are largely unavailable on land,” the study said.
That leaves polar bears essentially starving.
“There’s going to be a time point when you run out of energy,” Molnar said. “Not only do the bears have to fast for longer and need more energy to get through this, they also have a harder time to accumulate this energy.”
The reduced energy will also impact other factors of polar bear existence, like finding a mate, causing reproduction levels to plummet. Having less energy can also affect female bears’ ability to produce milk to feed their cubs.
“What we’ve shown is that, first, we’ll lose the survival of cubs, so cubs will be born but the females won’t have enough body fat to produce milk to bring them along through the ice-free season,” Amstrup told the BBC. “Any of us know that we can only go without food for so long. That’s a biological reality for all species.”
The study modeled the physical conditions of bears and calculated the amount of time they could reasonably fast.
“By estimating how thin and how fat polar bears can be, and modeling their energy use, we were able to calculate the threshold number of days that polar bears can fast before cub and/or adult survival rates begin to decline,” Molnar said in a statement.
The researchers found that the length of the fasting season will soon exceed the bears’ physical abilities.
“Intersecting these fasting impact thresholds with the projected future number of days that sea ice will be absent, we were able to project when fasting impact thresholds will be exceeded in different parts of the Arctic,” said Cecilia Bitz, a climate scientist at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study.
Molnar described polar bears as the “poster child for climate change.”
“Polar bears have long been considered messengers of the climate change symptoms that will impact all life, including humans,” said Amstrup. “We know that floods, droughts, and wildfires will become more frequent and severe as the world continues to warm, but timelines for such events are hard to predict… Showing how imminent the threat is for different polar bear populations is another reminder that we must act now to head off the worst of future problems faced by us all.”
Andrew Derocher, a professor at the University of Alberta who studies polar bears, told The Times that the study’s findings “are very consistent with what we’re seeing” from observing the animals in the wild.
“The study shows clearly that polar bears are going to do better with less warming,” he said. “But no matter which scenario you look at, there are serious concerns about conservation of the species.”
Another study published in the journal PLOS ONE in 2016 found that polar bears in the Beaufort Sea near Alaska and western Canada were three times as likely to come on land during the summer than they were in the 1980s. The bears now spend an average of 31 more days of the year on land than they did three decades earlier.
That has contributed to a 40% decline in population among the region’s polar bear population. The bears in the Beaufort Sea also experience lower weight, worse body condition, and lower cub survival than other similar subpopulations.
In Russia, authorities had to declare a state of emergency last year after a remote village region called Novaya Zemlya was overrun by dozens of starving polar bears.
“I have been on Novaya Zemlya since 1983, but there has never been such an invasion of polar bears before,” Zhiganshi Musin, the head of region’s administration, told reporters. “They are literally chasing people and going into the entranceways of housing buildings.”
“Everyone understood that this could happen,” Mikhail Stishov, the World Wildlife Fund’s project coordinator on Arctic biodiversity, told a Russian news agency. “Now the bears are increasingly on the shores on account of the absence of ice for long periods. They come onto shore, where they get used to human housing.”

No one who’s been paying attention to the commander-in-chief’s priorities, which seem to align with bashing liberal state leaders, tweeting about his competitor in the 2020 election, and the heavy-hitter, getting re-elected.
Fittingly, Trump spent his Saturday at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. with NFL Hall-of-Famer Brett Favre. “Brett LOVES Wisconsin, Mississippi and Minnesota.

Brian Morgenstern, White House deputy press secretary, told WTMJ-TV Favre and Trump “discussed the importance of sports as a critical unifying and uplifting part of the safe reopening of America.” The NFL Players Association announced an agreement with players on Friday to move on with training camp, giving “high-risk candidates” an option to opt-out and instead receive a $350,000 stipend. The decision fails to follow the advice of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “Unless players are essentially in a bubble — insulated from the community and they are tested nearly every day — it would be very hard to see how football is able to be played this fall,” Fauci told CNN in June.
The coronavirus death toll has only increased since June, when fewer than 120,000 people had died of the virus. The United States’ COVID-19 death toll was more than 146,000 Saturday, ABC News reported. In single-day, coronavirus death tallies, states reported 1,037 deaths Saturday, 1,178 deaths Friday, 1,039 Thursday, 1,126 Wednesday, and 1,029 deaths Tuesday, according to the volunteer-led COVID Tracking Project.
Our daily update is published. States reported 798k tests and 65k new cases of COVID-19.

But just as he did in June, Trump has remained consistent in his push for a return to normalcy. That includes resuming professional sports. “Tony Fauci has nothing to do with NFL Football,” Trump tweeted on June 19. “They are planning a very safe and controlled opening.”
In the tweet, the president also threatened to stop watching NFL games if players didn’t stand for the National Anthem following NFL commissioner Roger Goodell’s about-face on peaceful protests in light of George Floyd’s death. The unarmed Black man died in police custody May 25 after a Minneapolis cop kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. And in response to widespread protests in support of Floyd, Goodell conveniently claimed last month the league now supports players who want to “protest peacefully.”
<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>
This is years after the NFL all but banned free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 when he started taking a knee during the National Anthem to protest police brutality and racism, an act Favre spoke out in support of recently. He said Kaepernick’s sacrifice reminded him of that of Pat Tillman, a former NFL safety who quit professional sports to serve in the U.S. Army in 2002 and was killed two years later by friendly fire, NBC Sports reported. Favre tweeted June 22 that both Kaepernick and Tillman “sidelined their football dreams in pursuit of a cause.”
Including Pat Tillman’s name in the interview on Colin Kaepernick was not a comparison of the two, but a recognition that they both sidelined their football dreams in pursuit of a cause. Pat tragically lost his life, making the ultimate sacrifice, and deserves the highest honor.

Trump, who earlier implied Kaepernick was a “son of a b—h,” instead lambasted the NFL for even appearing to support Black players calling for justice. These are the same players whom Trump seems to expect to risk their wellbeing to entertain the country during a deadly pandemic. He has so desperately and recklessly focused on reopening the country that more than 150 worried scientists, educators, medical experts, and other professionals got together to sign a letter asking leaders to halt reopening plans to contain the virus’ spread, CNN reported.
“Right now, we are on a path to lose more than 200,000 American lives by November 1st. Yet, in many states people can drink in bars, get a haircut, eat inside a restaurant, get a tattoo, get a massage, and do myriad other normal, pleasant, but non-essential activities,” authors penned in the letter.

0,2020-07-27T11:58:58+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/inside-the-impact-of-rural-voters-on-the-democratic-party/,Inside the impact of rural voters on the Democratic Party,"It’s another Sunday, so for those who tune in, welcome to a diary discussing the Nuts & Bolts of a Democratic campaign. If you’ve missed out, you can catch up any time: Just visit our group or follow the Nuts & Bolts Guide. Every week I try to tackle issues I’ve been asked about. With the help of other campaign workers and notes, we address how to improve and build better campaigns, or explain issues that impact our party.
In my normal structure of Nuts & Bolts, I work to help someone who may never be involved directly in a campaign understand how a small campaign may work. I try not to cover the large scale items or very complex workings—like communications and field campaign strategies, which get too detailed, and are better done in person or through an actual training program. In a broad overview, though, one item needs to be addressed before the 2020 election and it is simple: as a party, we often misunderstand rural voters. These mistakes, made based on geography not based on voter tendencies and psychology are easy to fix. We just have to commit to actually talking to, and listening to, rural voters
Understanding the democratic base
Recently, at a forum for statewide candidates, the question centered around how much attention to put into areas which were more difficult for Democratic voters, and who would motivate those voters. An individual stood up and made the case clear that in order to potentially win, they would need a more conservative Democratic candidate. This analysis was—in my opinion—too surface level and did not appreciate who were the Democratic voters. It didn’t take too long before it was clear that in the Democratic primary, the candidate who advertised themselves as pro-choice and pro-LGBTQ rights would easily win the primary, while the anti-choice Democratic candidate would suffer a significant defeat.
Others had warned that this outcome would result in terrible outcomes for the fall. What really happened, in 2018, was that the pro-choice, pro-LGBTQ rights candidate ended up becoming governor of Kansas.
Why was that true? What we discovered is that if you were a registered Democratic voter in rural counties, you chose to be registered Democratic in an area where that wouldn’t always be popular. Understanding our own base can be very important.
A loss can be a win
Many races around the country cover significant geographical areas. An elected district can include several counties, cities, or areas in order to comprise their voting base. In these races, Democratic consultants will often focus on heavy and high turnout in known Democratic areas, looking to solidly outpace rural areas to bring in a win. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this strategy, as long as it is not the only strategy. Rural areas often have higher voter turnout per percentage because they have more social pressure to participate. After the 2018 election, YouGov did an interesting breakdown of the issues and how they play out even inside a party from urban to rural.
What a lot of this can boil down to is that you do not need to win these districts to win a larger race. In 2016, several counties in Oklahoma and Kansas, as an example, went nearly 90-10 Trump to Hillary. The moment you begin to turn those districts 70-30 you lose them, but you start making up ground county by county. The party can’t over-invest in rural areas in comparison to their voter turnout, but they also cannot abandon them as well. This is a juggling act to make sure we get the most voter impact for the investment.
Is this really white privilege?
In terms of the Electoral College, and even the House, a lot of the problems with all of these strategies comes down to the simple fact that terribly drawn districts or districts that pack together voters in such a way that we diminish the impact.
We’ve known about this for quite some time. Slate wrote about this in 2006:
“As a mapmaker, I can have more of an impact on an election than a campaign, than a candidate,” says Republican consultant David Winston, who drew House seats for the GOP after the 1990 U.S. Census. “When I, as a mapmaker, have more of an impact on an election than the voters, the system is out of whack.”
So, what happens? The unfortunate truth is pretty simple. If a state uses redistricting based on a philosophy of diluting likeminded voters so far apart to give them no voice (cracking), or packing them together so tightly as to hand over districts but prevent impact anywhere else (packing), they can do a lot of harm to Democratic efforts.
Why? Because when it comes to many of these races, especially congressional races and how they twist up with states that have a wide rural population, packed urban districts can lower turnout because the outcome is assured. Missouri 2016 is an example I often think about when it comes to the impact of packing. Kansas City and St. Louis are drawn into tight, packed districts that guarantee they will be democratically held. As a result, they don’t have the same contact numbers as if they were, well, a little bit less packed.
Jason Kander lost Missouri by 78,000 votes. Due to packing, however, looking at the House district returns, you see something interesting. In competitive races—like U.S. House seat 2 in Missouri, 413,000 total votes were case, and the Democratic candidate, Bill Otto, lost with 155,689. In U.S. House district 5, the Kansas City area, Emanuel Cleaver II also won 55-38, the same percentage Otto lost by, but with 190,766 votes, a total of 324,000 votes cast in that U.S. House district.
When the voters have less competition, or they feel as though their state is not going to be overall competitive for major races but their district is safe they have less reason to vote.
This allows packing to minimize the voices of minority communities by continuing to pack the districts and spread the message: look, this district is democratic, so that’s fine, we gave you that, just don’t show up because your state is lost.
Rural Republicans keep showing up, and turn out in packed districts declines. Until (or if) districts are defined in a way that is not as packed/cracked, we have to see the solution we do have is to work at any level to turn the races we can compete, no matter where they are, and a way to do that is not buying into the idea that rural community democratic voters are conservative democratic voters. The answer remains the same: actually go talk to them, rather than offer prescriptions without hearing their issues. You might be surprised.

While some are finally wearing masks in public spaces, a few are taking the opportunity as a way to express their xenophobia and racist views. In a video shared on social media, a man and a woman can be seen wearing swastika masks in a Minnesota Walmart, when confronted by other customers the woman made aggressive gestures.
“If you vote for Biden, you’re going to be living in Nazi Germany,” the woman with the swastika mask said to shopper Raphaela Mueller. The video, which has since then gone viral, was filmed and shared to Facebook by Mueller. In addition to posting the video, Mueller shared that she was born and raised in Germany and had grown up hearing stories of her great-grandmother who had fought in the underground against the Nazis.
“Let me make this abundantly clear once and for all – THE SWASTIKA IS A HATE SYMBOL AND YOU DO NOT FLY THE FLAG, YOU DO NOT WEAR THE SYMBOL ANYWHERE ON YOUR BODY, YOU DO NOT USE OR DEFEND THIS SYMBOL, EVER. END OF STORY,” Mueller said on Facebook. Mueller noted that her post needed edits from “trolls and haters” commenting. Before editing the post, Mueller shared that her first reaction upon seeing the masks was “nausea and wanting to cry” she added that she “can’t imagine what that must feel like for other people who lost family members in the Holocaust.”
In the video, another shopper can be heard telling the couple that they are “sick” in addition to referencing World War II. “We literally had a war about this. And the Nazis lost,” the shopper said. “You cannot be American and wear that mask.”

According to the Star Tribune, the couple was allegedly using the masks to protest the state’s mask mandate, which went into effect on Saturday. Marshall city law enforcement responded to the incident Saturday afternoon and issued trespass notices to the two. Should they return to the store the couple could face arrest, police said. While the 59-year-old man and 64-year-old woman both left without charges, the trespass notice bans them from visiting any Walmart for at least one year, KARE-TV reported.
In response to the incident, Walmart officials issued a statement on Saturday calling the series of events “unacceptable”. “We strive to provide a safe and comfortable shopping environment for all our customers and will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment in any aspect of our business. We are asking everyone to wear face coverings when they enter our stores for their safety and the safety of others and it’s unfortunate that some individuals have taken this pandemic as an opportunity to create a distressing situation for customers and associates in our store,” Walmart said, Kiro7 reported.
The city of Marshall is home to a growing and diverse community.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100 Somali community members came together and fundraised to support the city and its residents. “As we battle COVID-19 our Somali Community in Marshall have come together and asked ourselves what can we do as citizens of this great City of Marshall we all love and call home,” Mohamed Ahmed, local Somali Community Leader told Marshall Radio. “We all need to come together and help each other in any way we can because we are all in this together.”
But despite the city’s diversity and pride in it, just 50 miles away in Murdock, white supremacists are grouping together to claim roots in the area. “We just don’t need this crap out here,” Peter Kennedy, a resident of Murdock said. “What other religion in the world makes a big deal out of the color of your skin?” He added: “Maybe the real face of racism is coming to meet us face to face in Murdock.” As more racists, xenophobic, and anti-Semitic individuals come together to protest safety measures and threaten the diversity of a town, it is up to residents and the nation as a whole to remind them that discrimination will not be welcome or accepted in this country.

He has to cover up for the fact he is personally responsible for killing tens of thousands of Americans. It’s impossible to conceal that for much longer.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, Democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report. I’m Amy Goodman.
Barely 100 days before the presidential election in November, this week President Trump announced he is sending a surge of federal officers into large Democrat-run cities like Chicago. This comes after Trump first sent federal agents to Portland, Oregon, where the camouflage-clad paramilitary agents attacked antiracist protesters, even snatched activists off the streets in unmarked vans. On Wednesday night, when federal forces fired tear gas at protesters in Portland once again, among those hit was Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, who also serves as Portland’s police commissioner.
The response to Trump’s outrageous and likely unconstitutional deployment of federal agents has been resoundingly critical. Oregon Governor Kate Brown denounced the “secret police abducting people,” and the Oregon Attorney General has now sued several of the federal agencies involved. In the streets, a contingent of women has grown nightly, protecting protesters by forming a wall of moms. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden described the federal agents as “essentially fascist,” and warned, “If the line is not drawn in the sand right now, America may be staring down the barrel of martial law in the middle of a presidential election.”
Well, for more on this and much more, we spend the rest of the hour with Noam Chomsky, the world-renowned political dissident, linguist, and author, laureate professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and Professor Emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught for more than 50 years.
He spoke with Democracy Now!’s Nermeen Shaikh and I on Thursday. We reached him at his home in Tucson, Arizona, where he is sheltering in place with his wife, Valeria. I began by asking Professor Chomsky to respond to the surge of federal agents Trump is promising to unleash on the country.
NOAM CHOMSKY: President Trump is desperate. His entire attention is—there’s one issue on his mind; that’s the election. He has to cover up for the fact that he is personally responsible for killing tens of thousands of Americans. It is impossible to conceal that much longer. Just compare the United States with Europe or even Canada; it’s becoming a pariah state to the point where Americans aren’t even permitted to travel to Europe. Europe won’t accept them.
His chances of victory depend on his doing something dramatic. He was trying very hard to set up military confrontations that you mentioned, martial law. It’s moving toward martial law. He might even be able to try to cancel the elections. There is no telling what he would do. He is completely desperate. This is like the actions of some tin-pot dictator in a neo-colony somewhere, small country that has a military coup every couple of years. There is no historical precedent for anything like this in a functioning democratic society. If he could send Blackshirts out in the streets, he would be happy to do that.
Exactly how this will eventuate is very hard to say. The courts are unlikely to do anything. We may even get to a point where the military command has to decide which side they are on. The man is desperate. He is psychotic. He is in extreme danger of losing his position in the White House and will do anything he can to prevent it.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: Professor Chomsky, what you just said echoed the concerns of Senator Ron Wyden that we may be headed—the U.S. may be headed towards the imposition of martial law. You’ve just called Trump psychotic, previously having referred to him as a sociopath. And pointed to the differences between—the massive differences between Biden and Trump when we had you on earlier this year, saying about Biden that he is pretty empty, you can push him one way or another. And you’ve also said that this is the most crucial election in human history, literally. Now, in a Fox News interview just on Sunday, Trump refused to commit to accepting the outcome of the 2020 election.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I’m not a good loser. I don’t like to lose. I don’t lose too often. I don’t like to lose.
CHRIS WALLACE: But are you gracious?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You don’t know until you see. It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election. I really do.
CHRIS WALLACE: Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have to see. Look, Hillary Clinton asked me the same thing.
  NERMEEN SHAIKH: Could you comment on that and what your concerns are in the event—I mean, you’ve just said that in fact the elections somehow could be canceled. Could you talk about under what conditions Trump might be able to do that? And in the event they are not canceled, what are your concerns, depending on the outcome of the vote, what Trump might do?
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, there are various maneuvers that theoretically they might undertake. One might be to try to throw the election to the—to refuse to accept the vote, to make sure that the Republican governors don’t authorize their own electors. This is routine and automatic, but technically, they could refuse. Could throw it into the House where there is enough Republicans in the House to essentially turn the election into the kind of farce that you find, as I said, in some tin-pot dictatorship. That is one possibility. Another possibility is he might just try to call out the military to impose martial law.
The point is, he cannot lose. First of all, he is psychologically incapable of losing. Secondly, if he loses, if he leaves the White House, he may be facing serious legal problems. Now he has immunity, but there is a whole swamp around him. He has tried to keep it from being investigated. He fired all the inspectors general when they were beginning to investigate it. The federal attorney for the Southern District of New York, that’s Wall Street and so on, the most important, started looking into it. Fired him, replaced him with a flack from the private equity industry. There is nothing he would not do to try to maintain office. Virtually nothing you can think of.
This is a major crisis. There is been one or other form of parliamentary democracy for 350 years in England, and 250 years here, and nothing like this has happened before. We are dealing with a figure who is out of the political spectrum for functioning democracies. And he has a political party behind him which by now has just turned into cowardly sycophants. They are terrified to cross His Imperial Majesty. He has got a popular base of heavily armed, angry white supremacist militias. There is no telling what he would do. I think the country, by November, may be a different country. And A different world, given U.S. power.
But that is kind of the immediate issue. The reason why this is the most important election in history has nothing to do with this. Four more years of Trump’s climate policies and nuclear policies might simply doom the human species, literally. We don’t have a lot of time to deal with the environmental crisis. It is very serious. Every prediction that has been made by scientists has been too conservative. Each time it comes out worse.
I won’t run through the details but it is a major catastrophe looming. We have some time to deal with it. Four more years of Trump might well take us to irreversible tipping points. At the very least, it will make it much harder to confront this growing crisis. There is no stopping the polar ice caps, the ice sheets from melting, the Amazon forest from being destroyed. Large parts of the world might become simply unlivable. We are talking about potential sea rises of maybe one or two feet by the end of the century. Much more, later. This is all totally catastrophic. You can’t conceive of how human society can survive in an organized way.
At the same time, Trump is dedicated to destroying the arms control regime. Last August he terminated the Reagan-Gorbachev INF treaty, which helped control the potential for nuclear war growing from a European conflict. Now he has dismantled the Open Skies Treaty that goes back to Eisenhower. That is gone. He has imposed frivolous demands to try to delay negotiations on the new START treaty, which the Russians have been pleading for for a long time. This is due for renewal in a few months. It may already be too late to renegotiate it, the last of the arms control treaties. He is now threatening to carry out nuclear weapons tests, tests that would undermine the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, almost 30 years. The United States never ratified it, but it has lived up to it.
All of this opens the door wider for other countries to react the same way. The arms industry is of course euphoric. They’re getting huge new contracts to develop major weapons to destroy all of us. This encourages others to do the same. So there are new contracts down the road for hopeless means to try to defend ourselves against the monstrosities that we’re helping to construct. This is Trump, racing toward this, apparently enjoying it. You can’t describe it in normal—the term you used, sociopath, is perfectly accurate. Whether this can be contained within the constitutional structures of the United States, we don’t know.
Something similar to this happened in the United Kingdom a couple of months ago. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, prorogated the Parliament, closed the Parliament, so that he could ram through his version of Brexit. This was regarded by British legal experts as the worst crisis in 350 years. Well, in Britain, the Supreme Court nullified it. It is unlikely to happen here.
I might say that there is another country that is trying to mimic the United States, Brazil, with another ridiculous dictator, Jair Bolsonaro, who’s trying to be a clone of Trump. He was being investigated by—he and his family involved in all kind of sordid criminal activities, came under investigation. He fired the investigators. But that was blocked by the courts in Brazil. Not here. When Trump fired them all, purged the executive, nothing from the courts. Nothing from the Republicans in Congress. Brazil at least has a thin barrier to another military dictatorship. The United States is in worse shape. This is pretty serious. There’s been nothing like it. There are no precedents that have any real relevance.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: Professor Chomsky, you’ve mentioned again now the lack of safeguards there are in the U.S. to the possible imposition of martial law. But even in other countries around the world where martial law has been declared, it requires minimally the compliance of those who are in charge of the military. Do you see those in the U.S. going along with Trump in the event that he chooses to attempt to declare martial law?
NOAM CHOMSKY: As I say, there is no precedent for this in any minimally functioning democracy. There are countries, many of them, where the military has taken over, often with U.S. support or even initiative, because we wanted to overthrow the civilian government. And nothing like this has happened since—aside from the fascist regimes and war regimes, totally different conditions. There’s just no precedent.
There was, as you may recall, a couple of weeks ago press reports with headlines about how Trump is expanding his purge of the executive, which has almost been cleansed of any controls or dissident voices. He’s extending this to trying to purge the military. Well, there were speculations at the time that the purge of the military might be preparation for a plan to try to bring the military in to carry out something which would amount to a military coup.
The military so far has been refusing. Pulled out the 82nd Airborne from Washington after Trump wanted it in there. They have been rejecting the proposals from the White House for more force and violence. That is why he is resorting to forces outside the official military in his current campaign to set up violent confrontations in Democratic-run cities, the plan right now. What the military would do, we don’t know.
If you look for precedents in Third World dictatorships, it would depend on how those at the colonel level react, people close in contact with troops. But we have no precedent for anything like this. There’s nothing like it. This is a unique situation in modern history, in the modern history of the democratic, more or less democratic societies.
AMY GOODMAN: MIT Professor Emeritus Noam Chomsky, linguist, author, activist. When we come back, I ask him about President Trump bragging about acing a cognitive test for dementia. All that and more, in a minute.

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
As millions of small businesses suffer to the point of going under, some in one industry have found a way to benefit: temp agencies.
Companies typically seek contracted temp workers because they don’t have to pay them benefits and can pick them up and let them go easily. For sudden needs brought on by COVID-19, such as conducting temperature checks and sanitizing workplaces, staffing companies can recruit, vet, hire and supply workers on a few days’ notice.
“It’s amazing, but our demand for services has just gone through the roof,” said Charles Tope, the CEO of Monterey, California-based Employnet, which works in industries ranging from health care to warehousing.
So it may come as a surprise that temp staffing companies like Employnet were among the biggest beneficiaries of small-business loans under the Paycheck Protection Program, which is designed to help hard-hit firms keep paying their employees. More than 11,000 such companies took in a total of between $3.6 billion and $7.9 billion, with about 4,600 of those getting more than $150,000 each. (So far overall, 4.9 million companies have received about $518 billion.)
And there was an oddity in the numbers: 174 claimed they saved 500 jobs each, the maximum under the law, at a rate seven times higher than the share of recipients overall that said they retained 500 jobs. Most temp companies don’t have that many people on their permanent office staff. The explanation? Many were counting workers contracted by other companies as saved jobs, according to lenders, industry experts and staffing companies themselves.
That means many temp companies were able to double dip, getting paid twice for the same worker, once by the client and then again by taxpayers. Employers were allowed to claim loan amounts of 2.5 times their average monthly payroll in 2019. The loans become grants if companies spent most of the money on salaries and the rest on other specified expenditures. Because temps are technically a staffing company’s employees even though they’re working for someone else, the staffing company can claim forgiveness for all the wages they’re paid.
The program is administered by the Small Business Administration, which in early July released data showing loans of more than $150,000 in five ranges. Employnet got a loan of between $5 million and $10 million, the highest bracket, while bringing on 3,500 new workers on client accounts, Tope said. For its part, Employnet claimed it used the cash to save 490 jobs. Tope did not respond to questions about why it needed the PPP assistance.
The temp staffing double dip appears to be legal. “Staffing agencies are considered common law employers of the temporary and contract workers they assign to clients under long-standing IRS guidance and court rulings,” said Edward Lenz, senior counsel for the American Staffing Association. “Hence, they are employers for PPP purposes, just as they are for purposes of the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance mandate and many other laws.”
But it raises a concern that government money did not help to preserve jobs that were going to be lost, since the temps were going to be employed anyway.
“What you don’t want to be doing is giving public money to companies that are doing what they were already going to do,” said David Weil, dean of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University and former head of the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division.
Many temps don’t even know their employers got PPP loans. A worker employed by JM Staffing Solutions in New Brunswick, New Jersey, who asked for anonymity because she feared retaliation for speaking out, has been working full time throughout the pandemic at a laboratory putting labels on COVID tests. Although she said that workers are provided with adequate personal protective equipment, many had still gotten sick with the virus, and had not received sick leave as required by New Jersey law.
“We didn’t know anything about it, so maybe they’re keeping it to themselves,” said the worker, about the $2 million to $5 million JM Staffing had received. JM Staffing did not respond to a request for comment.
What’s more, the number of companies getting loans forgiven for temps that were still working may be larger than it appears. Because of anomalies in the data, some companies that don’t show up in the SBA’s database as having claimed the maximum 500 employees may still have their loans forgiven after paying temps who were still bringing in revenue.
The SBA shows Hicksville, New York-based Homecare Therapies LLC as taking a $5 million to $10 million loan and retaining just one job. Reached by email, however, President David Grossman said that’s not right. “We are only using it to pay our 400+ temps working for multiple clients,” he said.
The PPP was among the most generous of programs for businesses in the CARES Act. Loan programs for medium and large businesses spelled out in the bill generally were not forgivable. The program, which still has about $130 billion unspent, has helped float millions of businesses through an existentially threatening time, allowing them to keep workers employed even as workplaces shut down and customers dried up.
However, appraisals of the PPP by economists and policymakers have been mixed: While the program did inject hundreds of billions into the economy, it did not do so efficiently, often sending aid where it was less needed. The loans went through banks, which meant well-connected businesses had a far easier time getting their share.
The government designed and moved quickly on the PPP because many small businesses have less access to capital than medium and large businesses. But temp staffing companies, even small ones, are anomalous: They have access to financing through factoring companies, which advance the cash for payroll until the client pays its bills. Factors have lost business lately, since staffing companies are flush with cash from the SBA.
“It’s free money,” said Larry Holstein, who runs a staffing-focused factoring company called TemPay.
He broke down how the math works for a staffing company. Say a firm bills its client $15 an hour and pays the temp $10 an hour, including contributions for health insurance and retirement accounts. Its costs for the employee (such as taxes) are $2 an hour before other expenses, like rent. So the margin is $3.
But with the PPP, the company gets an extra $10 to fill the hole of the temp worker’s salary. So now the profits before overhead rise to $13 an hour per temp.
Not all temp staffing companies are thriving, especially those that serve the retail and hospitality industries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in the staffing industry plunged nearly 30% in April, wiping out 840,000 jobs (though many of those were part time).
Given the economic fallout, the American Staffing Association argued for more help, paying $80,000 in the second quarter to the high-powered lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs to press its case. As discussions were underway for industry-specific bailouts in the CARES Act, the staffing association asked for $35 billion.
“We need to be treated like the airlines and have our own recognition and carve-out,” said Patton Boggs’ Jack Kingston, a former member of Congress from Georgia, on a webinar with association members in early April. (The lobbyists also relayed their dismay with Congress’ action to grant $600 per week in extra unemployment insurance, fretting that it would prevent workers from coming back to their jobs.)
The ASA then argued that while staffing companies should be able to use temps to calculate their loan amount, they should not be penalized if they fail to retain those temps. “Staffing firms have no control over the size of their temporary workforces — reductions in temporary workers are solely determined by clients,” wrote ASA’s general counsel Stephen Dwyer in a comment on the PPP regulation. “Accordingly, we request that, solely for purposes of loan forgiveness, staffing firms be allowed to exclude the temporary workers they assign to clients in calculating reductions in their headcount or wages.”
Staffing companies could pass the money on to temps who were not placed with clients, which would fulfill the aim of the program. And some appear to have done so, including Herb Dew, who runs Greenville, South Carolina-based Human Technologies Inc., whose revenue fell 75%. His model is keeping longer-term “temps,” so he used his $5 million to $10 million PPP check to bridge their salaries until the factories where most of them work reopened. “Our priorities were retention of employees, benefits continuation and then managing unemployment claims for employees so we didn’t lose them,” Dew said.
But Dew’s company is likely an outlier, experts said.
“I have had conversations about the possibility of staffing firms maintaining temp staff on their payrolls but am not aware of any circumstances where that has actually been the case,” said Fiona Coombe, director of legal and regulatory research at the research firm Staffing Industry Analysts.
Labor organizers also find it implausible that staffing agencies are keeping temps on payroll even with no jobs for them to do.
“In hundreds of personal contacts, interviews and surveys with temp workers focused on coronavirus, I’ve never heard of a temp getting paid to not work,” said Dave DeSario, the director of the nonprofit advocacy group Temp Worker Justice. “I figured if the staffing industry had any defense, it would be that the PPP was used to pay internal staff. But those numbers are so small compared to temps that these loan amounts make no sense.”
The SBA’s rules also favored temp agencies in another way. For most industries, companies qualified for the PPP loans by having fewer than 500 employees. But since most staffing agencies have far more than 500 temps on payroll at any given time, they benefited from the SBA’s alternative standard: Having a tangible net worth of less than $15 million and making less than $5 million in net income. Since staffing companies usually have little in the way of fixed assets or intellectual property, a company with thousands of temps can still be worth not very much on paper. The result: Some very large temp businesses appear to have made the cut.
Monroe Staffing Services and Key Resources Inc. both got loans for between $5 million and $10 million. They’re both subsidiaries of Staffing 360 Solutions, a Nasdaq-traded company that brought in $260 million in revenue in 2019 across the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Its head of U.S. staffing, Paul Polito, did not respond to a request for comment.
At least seven franchisees of ManpowerGroup, the third-largest staffing company in the world, received multimillion dollar loans. A spokeswoman for ManpowerGroup, Emma Almond, said that the franchisees are independently owned and operated and thus eligible to apply for the loans, and that “any funds received by franchises remain with that local entity.”
However, Manpower is not on the SBA’s list of franchises eligible for small business aid, and Almond did not respond to an inquiry as to why, nor did the franchisees respond to questions about their loans.

As flagged by Jared Holt of Right Wing Watch, several pro-Trump figures took to Twitter over the weekend to voice their displeasure with the Trump campaign’s texting strategy, which involves sending out panicky missives several times a day letting supporters know that they’re “failing” the president by not donating more money.
“You FAILED to use your 5x match,” reads one text message. “It EXPIRED… Why did you let us down? LAST CHANCE.”
“We texted you TWICE,” reads another. “Why did you let your 500% Trump House Patriot match expire AGAIN? We’ll give you 1 more chance.”
“WTF is wrong with you?” asked pro-Trump columnist Kurt Schlichter. “Stop this. Do it now.”
“I’m constantly getting texts like this from yesterday,” wrote one of Schlichter’s followers in response. “I received 4 of the same text, all within 10 mins of each other. I texted ‘STOP’ & got a text stating I’m now unsubscribed, only to have a different number send me more of the same the next day.”
Another one of Schlichter’s followers said that the constant barrage of texts “makes me sorry I ever donated to anyone’s campaign,” while another wondered, “Is the NRCC deliberately trying to sabotage the election?”
Many Trump supporters reacted angrily for being constantly shamed about their lack of financial support for the president.
“I badly want the President to win!” wrote Trump supporter Jon Schweppe. “I’m just worried this is putting ordinary people off. Ease up on the hostage demands.”
“These emails are so sleazy,” replied “Bitcoin millionaire” Erik Finman. “It’s really sad picturing grandmas and such getting these and believing it.”

0,2020-07-27T10:20:02+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/voting-rights-roundup-trumps-order-to-remove-noncitizens-from-key-census-data-sparks-lawsuits/,Voting Rights Roundup: Trump’s order to remove noncitizens from key census data sparks lawsuits,"LEADING OFF
● 2020 Census: Donald Trump signed a new executive order on Tuesday directing the census to exclude undocumented immigrants from the data that determines how many House seats and Electoral College votes each state will get following the 2020 census.
Within days, civil rights advocates and Democratic officials filed separate federal lawsuits arguing both that Trump’s order violates the Constitution because the 14th Amendment mandates counting the “whole number of persons” for reapportionment and that it intentionally discriminates against Latinos.
This order comes after Trump’s failed attempt to add a citizenship question to the census last year, a move that documents showed was motivated because GOP operatives believed it would be “advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites” in redistricting.
While that effort imploded, Republicans still aim to let states such as Texas draw districts based strictly on the adult citizen population instead of the more diverse traditional total population, which would shift representation away from Democrats and Latinos in states with large immigrant populations. To that end, Trump issued a separate executive order last year directing the Census Bureau to match existing administrative records with 2020 census responses in order to determine citizenship status, a step that prompted litigation of its own.
But while the Supreme Court could ultimately allow the use of citizenship data for redistricting, it’s unlikely to do so for reapportionment: A unanimous 2016 ruling saw even arch-conservative Justice Samuel Alito acknowledge that the 14th Amendment required using the total population for reapportionment purposes. But even if the justices did overturn hundreds of years of precedent, excluding undocumented immigrants from reapportionment would likely have a far smaller partisan impact nationally than citizen-based redistricting would within states such as Texas.
However, Trump’s continued push for this change shows that the GOP will not give up in its fight to exclude noncitizens from redistricting and representation, and further litigation is certain. Additionally, Trump asked Congress for $1 billion in the next pandemic spending bill to ensure a “timely census,” which suggests Trump is backing away from a potential delay in the deadlines by which the administration must deliver apportionment and redistricting data to the states.
The Census Bureau has previously said it didn’t expect to be able to meet its year-end deadline to give the White House its reapportionment data, or the March 31, 2021 deadline for sending redistricting data to the states. Any such delays mean that Joe Biden could block the release of citizenship data if he defeats Trump and takes office on Jan. 20. However, if the first batch of census data is released on time, that would mean Trump would still be in office, meaning opponents would have to rely on court challenges to block him.
VOTER REGISTRATION AND VOTING ACCESS
● Deaths: Following the death of Democratic Rep. John Lewis, who was one of the nation’s most prominent supporters of voting rights both during the civil rights movement of the 1960s and his long career in Congress, Senate Democrats introduced a bill named in Lewis’ honor to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court gutted in 2013, a bill that House Democrats already passed last year.
Should the bill become law, it would be a fitting way to enshrine Lewis’ legacy in public life. The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer aptly called Lewis “an American Founder” for his role in creating the modern American republic, which was no less than radically transformed by the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. These two landmark pieces of legislation ended the authoritarian one-party oligarchy that existed in the South under Jim Crow and finally established America as a liberal democracy nationwide—almost 200 years after the country’s founding.
Lewis was one the leading figures in the civil rights movement for Black Americans from an early age. When he was just 23, he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington, where Martin Luther King gave his legendary “I Have a Dream” speech. Two years later, he marched for voting rights in Selma, Alabama in 1965. There, law enforcement reacted to the peaceful protest by brutally attacking the marchers and beat Lewis nearly to death, fracturing his skull. But even real and repeatedly threatened violence did not deter his activism.
The events in Selma became known as Bloody Sunday, and TV news audiences around the country were so shocked by images of police brutality against the marchers that it galvanized the ultimately successful effort to pass the Voting Rights Act, which became law on Aug. 6, 1965. Civil rights leaders like Lewis and King deemed the Voting Rights Act the most important achievement of their movement because it protected the right that helped secure all the others that they were fighting for.
Lewis’ career of activism for the cause of civil rights did not end with the 1960s, nor did his role as a protest figure end with his election to Congress in the 1980s: Even in his final decade, he led a sit-in on the House floor to protest the GOP’s refusal to pass gun safety measures after a horrific mass shooting in Orlando left 49 dead and 53 wounded in 2016. Lewis would steadfastly make the case that the struggle for civil rights was an unending one, and his leadership inspired countless people who came after him. You can read more about Lewis’ lifetime of activism in The New York Times and The Atlanta Constitution.
● New York: Both chambers of New York’s Democratic-run legislature have passed a bill to enact automatic voter registration, sending the measure to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo for his likely signature. Senate Democrats had approved similar measures both this year and last, but Assembly Democrats refused to sign off until changes were made.
Part of the compromise between the chambers means the law wouldn’t go into effect until 2023. However, automatic registration would involve a number of state agencies beyond just the DMV, which is critical since New York has one of the lowest proportions of residents who drive of any state.
Separately, Senate Democrats also passed a constitutional amendment that would let 17-year-olds vote in primaries if they will turn 18 by the general election, a policy that many other states have already adopted. The amendment would have to pass both chambers before and after the 2020 elections before needing the approval of voters in a referendum.
FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT
● District of Columbia: Mayor Muriel Bowser has signed a bill into law that immediately restores voting rights for several thousand citizens and will require officials to provide incarcerated citizens with registration forms and absentee ballots starting next year. However, because the bill was passed as emergency legislation, it must be reauthorized after 90 days, though Council members plan to make it permanent soon.
With this law’s passage, D.C. becomes only the third jurisdiction in the country after Maine and Vermont to maintain the right to vote for incarcerated citizens. It is also the first place to do so with a large community of color: The District is 46% African American, and more than 90% of D.C. residents currently disenfranchised are Black.
VOTER SUPPRESSION
● Alabama: The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled 2-1 to uphold a lower court ruling dismissing the NAACP’s challenge to Alabama Republicans’ voter ID law. The two judges in the majority, who were both appointed by Republicans, ruled that “no reasonable factfinder could find that Alabama’s voter ID law is unconstitutionally discriminatory,” even though Judge Darrin Gayles, an Obama appointee, noted in dissent that one white GOP lawmaker who supported passing the law said that the lack of an ID requirement was “very beneficial to the Black power structure and the rest of the Democrats.”
Republicans passed this law in 2011 to require a photo voter ID in nearly all circumstances, with the only exception being if two election officials sign an affidavit that they know the voter. However, the law didn’t go into effect until 2014, after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority gutted a key protection of the Voting Rights Act that had required states such as Alabama with a history of discriminatory voting laws to “pre-clear” all changes to voting laws and procedures with the Justice Department before implementing them.
The plaintiffs sued in 2015 by arguing that the law violated the Voting Rights Act and Constitution and presented evidence that Black voters were less likely to possess acceptable forms of ID than white voters. That year, Republicans sparked a backlash by trying to close 31 of the state’s 75 driver’s licensing offices, which subsequent reporting revealed was an effort by GOP Gov. Robert Bentley, who later resigned in disgrace, to pressure his legislative opponents, but Republicans ultimately reversed course amid litigation.
Election expert Rick Hasen called this latest decision “very troubling” because it ruled unequivocally for GOP officials without letting the case proceed to trial, despite the plaintiffs’ evidence of both the intent and effect of racial discrimination against Black voters. The plaintiffs could seek to request that all judges on the 11th Circuit reconsider the ruling, or they could appeal directly to the Supreme Court. However, with Republican appointees holding majorities on both courts, their chance of success appears small.
● Michigan: A panel of three judges on the Michigan Court of Appeals has ruled 2-1 along ideological lines to uphold Republican-backed voting restrictions that Democrats were challenging. The ruling maintains a limitation on what counts as proof of residency for voter registration. It also rejects Democrats’ demand that the state start automatically pre-registering all citizens under age 18 who conduct business with the state’s driver’s licensing agency so that they will be automatically added to the rolls when they turn 18. Currently, only citizens aged 17-and-a-half or older are automatically registered.
Democrats have not yet indicated whether they will appeal to Michigan’s Supreme Court. The high court has a 4-3 Republican majority, though one of the GOP justices has been a swing vote when similar issues have come before the court.
● Tennessee: Voting rights advocates have filed a lawsuit in state court to require Tennessee officials to comply with a 1981 law that restores voting rights to people convicted of a felony in another state if they have had their rights restored in that state. The plaintiffs argue that the state’s Republican-run government has failed to educate affected voters of the ability to regain their rights. They also charge that the state is requiring the payment of any legal fines or fees, even though such repayment isn’t required under the law.
● Texas: A federal district court has rejected a Republican motion to dismiss a Democratic-backed lawsuit seeking to require that Texas allow voters to register online via a third-party website. The case concerns the website Vote.org, which allows applicants to fill out a registration form and then (on its end) automatically prints it and mails it to local election officials. However, the GOP-run secretary of state’s office rejected thousands of such applications shortly before the registration deadline in 2018 on the grounds that the signatures were transmitted electronically rather than signed with pen on paper.
Democrats argue that these rejections violate both state and federal law. They note that the secretary of state already allows electronic signatures if they’re part of applications when voters register in-person through the state’s driver’s licensing agency. Texas Republicans have long resisted online registration, making it one of just a handful of states that doesn’t offer it to most voters. As a result, the Lone Star State is home to a majority of the Americans who live in states without full online registration.
ELECTORAL REFORM
● Massachusetts: Massachusetts officials have approved an initiative for the November ballot that would enact a statute implementing instant-runoff voting in elections for Congress and state office. It would also apply to a limited number of local contests such as countywide posts for district attorney and sheriff, but not those at the municipal level, which is the primary unit of local government in New England. If adopted, the new system would come into effect in time for the 2022 elections and would make Massachusetts the second state after Maine to adopt this reform.
REDISTRICTING
● New York: Democratic legislators in New York swiftly passed a constitutional amendment with little debate that would increase the likelihood that they could exercise full control over redistricting after 2020 and gerrymander the state’s congressional and legislative maps. However, the amendment’s provisions are more complicated than an attempt to just seek partisan advantage, and it still has a ways to go before becoming law.
New York has a bipartisan redistricting commission that proposes maps to legislators for their approval. Legislative leaders from both parties choose the members, and the 2014 amendment that enshrined it in the state constitution requires two-thirds supermajorities for legislators to disregard the commission’s proposals and enact their own if one party controls both legislative chambers, as Democrats currently do. The biggest partisan impact this new amendment would have involves lowering that threshold to three-fifths.
Democrats hold a two-thirds supermajority in the Assembly but currently lack that in the state Senate. However, they exceed three-fifths in the upper chamber, meaning they would gain control over redistricting if the amendment were law today. However, there’s a good chance the lowered threshold would be irrelevant for the next round of redistricting.
That’s because Democrats have a strong opportunity to gain a Senate supermajority in November, thanks to a large number of Republican retirements in swing districts and an overall political climate that favors Democrats. Still, lowering the supermajority requirement to three-fifths could still prove decisive in the future, especially if Democrats fall short of their hopes this fall, so it’s therefore fair to describe the move as an attempt by Democrats to gain greater control over redistricting.
Nevertheless, several other provisions in this amendment promote nonpartisan goals that would strengthen redistricting protections regardless of who draws the lines, complicating the case for whether or not New York would be better off in the short term if the amendment were to become law. Most importantly, the amendment would let New York conduct its own census for redistricting purposes if the federal census does not count undocumented immigrants, as Trump has ordered.
It also enshrines an existing statute that bans prison gerrymandering by counting incarcerated people for redistricting purposes at their last address instead of in prisons that are largely located in whiter rural upstate communities, restoring representation to urban communities of color. In addition, it freezes the number of senators at the current 63; in the past, lawmakers have expanded the size of the body in an attempt to gain a partisan advantage. Finally, it sharply limits the splitting of cities between Senate districts, something the GOP used extensively in their successful bid to win power (supported by several renegade Democrats) after the last round of redistricting.
Democrats would need to pass this same amendment again in 2021 before putting it on the ballot as a referendum that year, meaning it could pass without GOP support, but it would still require voter approval. If enacted, it would immediately take effect.
● North Carolina: Earlier this month, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed a bill passed almost unanimously by North Carolina’s Republican legislature to undo one of the GOP’s many gerrymandering schemes, specifically one involving gerrymandering along racial lines in district court elections in Mecklenburg County. The GOP’s about-face came as Republicans were facing a near-certain loss in state court for infringing on Black voters’ rights in violation of the Voting Rights Act.
Mecklenburg County is a Democratic stronghold that’s home to Charlotte and more than one million residents. In 2018, Republican lawmakers changed Mecklenburg’s procedures for judicial elections from a countywide system to one in which the county is split into separate judicial districts, even though all of the elected judges still retain countywide jurisdiction. The GOP’s 2018 law gerrymandered the districts in an attempt to elect more white Republicans in place of multiple Black Democratic incumbents—precisely what came to pass that November.
Republicans had already agreed to revert back to countywide elections for 2020 while their case proceeded, but the lawsuit is moot now that Republicans have repealed the law in question. This GOP defeat means Republican legislators this past decade have lost lawsuits over their gerrymandering once or even multiple times at virtually every level of government in North Carolina, including for Congress, state legislature, county commission, city council, local school board, and, as here, judicial districts.
BALLOT ACCESS
● West Virginia: A federal district court has denied the GOP’s motion for summary judgment in a lawsuit in which Democrats are challenging a law that gives the party that won the last presidential election in the state—which has voted Republican in every race since 2000—the top spot on the ballot in every partisan contest. Barring a settlement, the case will now proceed to trial, which was previously set for July 27.
The plaintiffs argue that this system violates the First and 14th Amendments because candidates listed first can enjoy a boost in support that can prove decisive in close elections, particularly in downballot races where voters have much less information about the candidates than they do for the top of the ticket.
COURT CASES
● Maine: Maine Republicans have filed yet another lawsuit in federal court arguing that instant-runoff voting violates the U.S. Constitution and should be blocked in November, when it will be used in all federal races. Democratic Secretary of State Matt Dunlap recently determined that Republicans were roughly 2,000 voter signatures shy of the 63,000 signatures needed to put a veto referendum on the ballot in November that would suspend the use of IRV for the Electoral College until voters weigh in, but the GOP will separately challenge his decision in state court.
The federal suit is just the latest in the GOP’s long running campaign against IRV after voters approved it in a 2016 ballot initiative for state and congressional races (a state court later blocked it for state-level general elections). However, they may not have much more success than former Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin did when he argued that IRV was unconstitutional after he lost the 2018 election to Democratic Rep. Jared Golden once all instant-runoff calculations were completed. In that case, a federal court thoroughly rejected Poliquin’s arguments that IRV violated voters’ First and 14th Amendment rights.
ELECTION CHANGES
Please bookmark our litigation tracker for a complete summary of the latest developments in every lawsuit regarding changes to elections and voting procedures as a result of the coronavirus.
● Arkansas: A panel of three GOP-appointed judges on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has unanimously overturned a district court ruling that made it easier for redistricting reformers to gather signatures for a ballot initiative to create an independent redistricting commission. The lower court’s ruling, which the 8th Circuit had already temporarily blocked while the appeal proceeded, had suspended a requirement that voter petition signatures be witnessed in-person, enabling supporters to sign the forms at home and mail them in.
Republican Secretary of State John Thurston had recently thrown out all signatures gathered for the redistricting reform initiative and a separate initiative to adopt a variant of instant-runoff voting, and initiative supporters are separately challenging that decision in state court. Organizers have not announced whether they will appeal this latest federal court ruling.
● New Hampshire: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu has signed a law passed by New Hampshire’s Democratic-run legislature that will allow voters to use a single application to receive absentee ballots for both the Sept. 8 state primary and Nov. 3 general election.
● North Carolina: North Carolina’s Board of Elections has issued a rule that every county this fall must have at least one early voting location for every 20,000 registered voters and that smaller counties only operating one location must provide for a backup location and extra staff as a precaution.
● Oregon: A panel of three judges on the 9th Circuit Circuit Court of appeals has ruled 2-1 against Democratic officials’ request to block a lower court ruling that resulted in officials having to lower the number of signatures and extend the deadline to collect them for a ballot initiative to establish an independent redistricting commission. It’s possible that the Supreme Court could block the district court’s ruling if Oregon Democrats appeal, but they have yet to indicate whether they will do so.
● Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania Democratic Party has filed a lawsuit in state court seeking to effectively short-circuit a federal lawsuit that the Trump campaign and several GOP Congress members recently filed to restrict voting access, which the federal district court recently agreed to expedite.
Democrats are asking the appellate-level Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court to guarantee that counties can set up drop boxes for returning mail ballots; count ballots that are postmarked by Election Day and received within a few days afterward; give voters a chance to fix problems with mail ballot signatures; count mail ballots lacking an inner secrecy envelope; and prohibit voters from serving as poll watchers in a county where they aren’t a resident. The GOP’s federal lawsuit is trying to block drop boxes and allow out-of-county poll watchers, which is likely intended to facilitate voter intimidation.
● Rhode Island: Voting rights groups have filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging Rhode Island’s requirement that mail voters have their ballots signed by two witnesses or a notary, something that very few other states require. The plaintiffs argue that this requirement violates the Constitution during the pandemic, and they’re asking the court to waive it for the Sept. 1 primary and November general election.
● Tennessee: A federal district court judge has sided against civil right groups seeking to ease access to absentee voting ahead of the state’s Aug. 6 primary, ruling that the plaintiffs waited too long to bring their challenge, but the court allowed the case to proceed for November. The plaintiffs wanted the court to require that voters be notified and given a chance to correct any problems with their mail ballots and also allow third-party groups to collect and submit absentee ballots on behalf of voters.
● Texas: The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed with state Democrats’ request to expedite consideration of the GOP’s appeal of a lower court ruling that had ordered that all voters be allowed to vote absentee without needing an excuse instead of only voters aged 65 and up. The expedited timeline means there’s a chance of a resolution in time for November.

The problem, reports The Washington Post, is that the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign are both reluctant to hand over cash to the NRCC. In the national committee’s reasoning it doesn’t make sense to throw money at the House minority when there is a very real danger that Republicans could lose the Senate, in November, unless Republicans spend a mountain of money on that. In the Trump campaign’s reasoning it—ha, just kidding. The Trump campaign just doesn’t want to hand over cash because they’re jerks.
The Post‘s report is full of juicy tidbits worth savoring. McCarthy “specifically has asked” Trump failson-in-law Jared Kushner to direct money to the House, but Kushner isn’t having it. And even the Trump campaign is privately aware of what’s up: It’s not that the Trump campaign isn’t absolutely awash in money. It’s just that they don’t want to give it to anyone else. That’s grifting money, won fair-and-square.
“The campaign just wants the money…. They don’t care about the House—it’s not their concern,” the Post quotes an anonymous “official close with the Trump campaign.” Well, yes.
Another tidbit: “Those familiar” blame Kushner, for “failing to understand the importance of unity and working together.”
Wow. Yeah, go figure. If only there was something that might have indicated the extended Trump family were greed-obsessed sleazebags not interested in doing anything for anybody.
The Post also notes that House Republicans might be feeling especially burned because House Republicans have been making donations to Trump’s campaign, on request of the Trump campaign, only to turn around and get zip in return. And now House Republican challengers are trailing previously-thought-vulnerable House incumbents by a wide margin.
It turns out that one of the downsides of immunizing a corrupt president’s transparently corrupt behavior then falling in line behind him as his bungling narcissism-clouded incompetence kills 140,000 Americans while wrecking the nation’s economy is that by golly, it might turn out that the public decides that they hate your cowardly and crooked guts. The 140,000 dead Americans House Republicans can brush off, but when their usual donors aren’t coughing up cash because the economy has crashed and small donations from people who would rather not die for Dear Leader’s latest whims are piling up, that’s something even Kevin McCarthy will start noticing.
I think I speak for all of us when I say we absolutely and earnestly do not wish him well with any of it. McCarthy and his compatriots betrayed the country twice in short succession. It serves them right if, after everything else, their Dear Leader con-artist figurehead stiffs them.
After all, Trump and Kushner are trying to siphon off as much of that cash as possible into Trump’s own personal businesses. What does he care what happens to his House allies?

0,2020-07-27T10:13:52+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/barr-continues-his-retaliation-against-trump-critics-outs-a-russia-linked-fbi-source/,Barr continues his retaliation against Trump critics — outs a Russia-linked FBI source,"Trump-loyal Attorney General William Barr continues to use his granted federal powers to retaliate against Trump’s enemies—namely, those that would dare investigate Trump and his uncountably-many crooked allies. He has taken it upon itself to sabotage federal investigations, remove investigators and watchdogs who have taken on Trump-related cases, withhold evidence from Congress, order that testimony be withheld from Congress, and rigorously done whatever other actions would best cement conservative, fascist-premised power.
The Washington Post reports on a new instance, in which Barr ordered the declassification of a document last week that, upon delivery to senator and fellow corruption-enabler Lindsey Graham, within days resulted in the public outing of a secret FBI source. The reason? That source was one who compiled information for the now-infamous “dossier” collecting rumors and leads on Donald Trump’s dealings inside Russia, and we can presume the outing of this confidential source is in keeping with Barr’s brazenly public campaign of retaliation against those who investigated the connections between Russian election interference, in 2016, and Trump’s campaign.
Also in keeping with this administration’s fascist tendencies, whether this campaign of Trump-friendly declassifications results in people getting killed seems immaterial to Barr.
Igor Danchenko was, until last week, a source who used his Russian and Ukrainian contacts to pass information back to former British spy Christopher Steele, information that would be included in what is now known as the “Steele dossier” on Trump-Russia rumors. He spoke to the FBI, says the Post, on condition of secrecy to protect his foreign sources and his family from harm—a reasonable demand given the Putin government’s ongoing assassinations of Putin critics, journalists, and suspected spies.
While the FBI did redact Danchenko’s name from the material given to Graham, the surrounding text gave enough information to swiftly expose both Danchenko and at least one of his own alleged sources.
This seemingly intentional Barr “screw-up”, compromising promised anonymity to informants for the sake of discrediting the Robert Mueller investigation into Russian election hacking in particular, is part of a continued string of actions by an attorney general seemingly far more vested in punishing enemies than protecting national interests. It’s not hard to guess how the public identification of once-secret FBI sources will impact the willingness of future sources to come forward, especially if those sources have information about Donald Trump in particular.
Then again, that is almost certainly the intent.
While similar campaigns to publicly discredit and demonize individual federal agents, sources, and investigators have ended numerous careers—some on Trump’s orders, and some not—the exposure of Russian sources in particular adds a significant additional risk, however. Barr and Graham’s efforts to “investigate” and retaliate against those they believe have wronged Dear Leader may put foreign sources in real danger.
One gets the feeling that William Barr himself is indifferent about that. At best.

National polling results released Sunday by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 80% of U.S. adults across the political spectrum think the country is headed in the wrong direction. Only 8% of Democrats and 31% of Republicans—both record lows—say the nation is headed in the right direction.
With the November election 100 days away, more Americans say the country is heading in the wrong direction than at any previous point in Donald Trump’s presidency, putting the incumbent in a perilous position in his reelection bid against Joe Biden. https://t.co/g1ybeMUIvD
— Kat Stafford (@kat__stafford) July 26, 2020
Approval of Trump’s handling the Covid-19 pandemic also hit a record low, with just 32% respondents saying they approve. Similarly, only 36% said they approve of how the president has handled education and healthcare. Although more respondents (48%) said they approve of how Trump has handled the economy, that percentage still represented a significant drop from January, before the pandemic led tens of thousands of Americans to lose their jobs with limited support from the federal government.
Overall, 61% of Americans currently disapprove of Trump’s performance as president, which is a slight drop from earlier this year but still aligns with the public opinion throughout his first term. The poll was conducted July 16-20 and the margin of sampling error for all adults is +/- 4.3 percentage points.
Mounting frustration with the president could benefit Biden at the ballot box. As the AP reported in a piece about the polling results Sunday:
Biden’s campaign is eager to keep the final months of the campaign focused squarely on Trump, confident that the former vice president can emerge victorious if the contest is a referendum on whether the current commander in chief has succeeded during his four years in office.
  “People are sick and tired of a government that is divided and broken and unable to get things done,” said Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager. “What people feel like they’re getting from Trump right now is a hodgepodge mess of self-interested political talk.”
Biden is now leading in three battleground states that Trump won in the 2016 general election, according to CNN polling conducted by SSRS and released Sunday.
Among registered voters, the polling showed, the former vice president leads the current president 52% to 40% in Michigan, 51% to 46% in Florida,and 49% to 45% in Arizona. Trump’s overall disapproval rating is also notable in all three states: 57% in Michigan, 54% in Arizona, and 51% in Florida.
An even greater share of voters across all three states—60% in Arizona, 59% in Michigan, and 57% in Florida—disapprove of how Trump has handled the Covid-19 crisis, the pollsters found. The surveys were conducted July 18-24 and have a margin of sampling error of +/- 3.6 percentage points.

The polls on Sunday followed survey results released Friday by MoveOn Political Action that suggested Trump’s ongoing crackdown on protests in Portland, Oregon and his threats to send federal agents into other major U.S. cities could have consequences at the ballot box for not only him but also Republican senators facing re-election.
Those surveys conducted by Public Policy Polling showed that registered voters in Arizona, Maine, and North Carolina “don’t like what [Trump] is doing and are fed up” with Sens. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) “carrying water for him as he trundles toward authoritarianism,” tweeted MoveOn.
The advocacy group called on Congress to pass legislation to block the administration from replicating the conditions in Portland in other cities and “investigate this abuse of Trump’s power.” MoveOn added that “we all need to do our part, including by voting out Trump and his enablers.”
Stewart Boss, a spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told The Hill Sunday that voters have rushed to support Democratic candidates as Trump has seen his approval ratings drop during the pandemic and resulting economic crisis.
“While Republicans have mismanaged the response to this unprecedented public health and economic crisis, our momentum has grown as Democrats have expanded the Senate map and our potential paths to ending Mitch McConnell’s majority with 100 days to go,” Boss said, referencing the upper chamber’s GOP leader.
NEW: 100 Days: Democrats see clear path to Senate majority https://t.co/BDxMNUy4HC pic.twitter.com/DAyfx98246

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a former presidential primary candidate who is now a contender for Biden’s vice presidency, wrote in a series of tweets Sunday that there are only 100 days until the election, the country is facing multiple crises, “and Trump is unable to govern at even the most elementary level.”
We have much work ahead of us—and we will fight on because we know the America we are fighting for. An America where government is a force for good, and where decisions in Washington are made with compassion, common sense, and moral clarity.
— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) July 26, 2020
That’s the America we can create if we stand together, if we fight together, if we persist together. That’s the America we can build when we beat Donald Trump, elect @JoeBiden, and put Democrats in positions to make change all across the country.
— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) July 26, 2020
“The next 100 days will decide what kind of country we build together,” Warren concluded. “We know this won’t be easy. Nothing important ever is. We don’t take on this fight because it’s easy—we take on this fight because it’s right. And I’m proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with you in it.”

Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Sunday blasted waiters, waitresses and bus boys who he said don’t deserve an additional $600 per week for being unemployed during the coronavirus pandemic.
In an interview on CBS, Cruz told host Margaret Brennan that restaurant owners are at a disadvantage because their staff doesn’t want to work while the pandemic is ongoing.
“We need to do significantly more to fight the disease,” Cruz opined. “At the same time, we have an absolute economic catastrophe. We have over 44 million Americans [who] have lost their job and we have got to get America back to work.”
According to Cruz, Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (CA) are “shoveling cash at the problem.”
“Do you object to providing any kind or any amount of federal boost to unemployment?” Brennan wondered. “Because not everyone is choosing to be out of work.”
“The policy the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi are pushing adds an additional $600 a week,” Cruz complained. “The problem is, for 68% of people receiving it right now, they are being paid more on unemployment than they made in their job.”
“I’ve spoken to small business owners all over the state of Texas who are trying to reopen,” he continued, “and they are calling their waiters and waitresses, they are calling their bus boys and they won’t come back.”
Cruz added: “And of course they won’t come back because the federal government is paying them in some instances twice as much money to stay home.”

It’s what motivates him, validates him, makes him happy, if that’s at all possible. And once upon a time, he had a lot more of it than presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. But those days are now over.
Because not only do Biden and his allies have more money, but they aren’t beset by all the problems that come with an association with any Trump organization—fraud, waste, grift, and abuse.
It wasn’t too long ago that Trump had a massive fundraising advantage over a hapless Biden, then stumbling through the Democratic primary on name recognition and latent affection from his eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president. In March of this year, Trump had raised $212 million and had $240 million in the bank. For his part, Biden was $187 million behind that point. As a NY Times writer put it, “Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Democratic Party could raise almost $1 million every single day between now and November, and he would still barely catch up to what President Trump and the Republican Party had in the bank at the start of April—let alone what Mr. Trump will have by Election Day.”
What a difference the four months since have made.
Today, Biden has raised $273.7 million, while allied super PACs have raised another $136.5 million, or a combined $410.2 million. Trump and his outside group allies have raised a combined $415.6 million, meaning that the Democratic effort has reached near-parity. Furthermore, Trump and his allies have $134.2 million in the bank, less than Biden and his allies at $146.9 million.
Given that Biden has outraised Trump the last two months, you don’t have to go out on a limb to predict that Democrats will have a healthy cash advantage in the stretch run of the race. But that’s just on the fundraising side. The expense side … well, Trump is going to Trump, which means, he’s grossly mismanaging his cash.
If you exclude outside groups, both campaigns have about the same cash on hand—$113 million for Trump, and $109 million for Biden. Yet the Trump campaign has spent $80 million more—$247.3 million versus $164.8 million. How does a campaign spend that much more to fall deeply behind his opponent?
Rather small gap at the moment between tipping-point state polls and national polls:
National: Biden +7.7
Florida: Biden +7.5
New Hampshire: Biden +7.1
Michigan: Biden +7.0
Pennsylvania: Biden +6.7
Wisconsin: Biden +6.6
Nevada: Biden +6.5https://t.co/nWUo9X5F4y pic.twitter.com/D0IccKEzCL
— Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) July 23, 2020
1. He’s spending money on the wrong things.
I’ve discussed it before. His campaign has spent tens of million in TV ads in Iowa and Ohio, two states that won’t have any definitive say in who wins the election. Look at the Nate Silver tweet above—flipping just Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin gives Biden a 307-231 Electoral College victory. Add Arizona and North Carolina, two more states that Biden leads in, and we’re talking 333-205. Iowa and Ohio don’t even factor in that calculation. By the time Biden flips those two states, he will have also flipped Georgia, the Maine rural electoral college vote, and the Omaha Nebraska electoral college vote, for a total of 351-187.
Yet not only had Trump spent heavily on those states when I wrote that original post two weeks ago, but Trump has doubled down on Ohio.
That’s nearly $20 million spending, second only to Florida, in a state that isn’t even a core battleground.
Meanwhile, as of two weeks ago he had spent $16.4 million on legal fees, for such failed efforts as suing CNN for running a poll, suing newspapers for reporting on Trump’s quid pro quo with Russia, suing tiny Wisconsin TV stations for airing Democratic ads, and so on. All those efforts fail, designed to make Trump happy, not to actually accomplish what campaigns are supposed to accomplish—win. Trump has gotten through life by suing his way out of his failures. The strategy is finally failing.
2. He’s running a grifting and nepotistic family criminal enterprise.
The Trump campaign has made a systemic effort to funnel as much campaign donor money into his pockets as possible. It’s almost as if they see their gravy train ending after this year, and need to suck up as much of that cash as possible to prop up their failing enterprises.
You don’t have to be a stable genius to see the pattern.
As for nepotism, we have new headlines like “Kimberly Guilfoyle under fire for Trump fundraising disarray.” Giving something as important as your campaign’s big-dollar fundraising to your son’s girlfriend, with no prior fundraising experience, might seem as stupid a move as, say, putting Jared Kushner in charge of Middle East peace, or putting Jared Kushner in charge of the coronavirus pandemic response, or putting Jared Kushner in (de facto) charge of the Trump campaign, or putting Jared Kushner in charge of solving America’s opioid epidemic, or putting Jared Kushner in charge of reforming veterans care. …
Here’s the thing to note about Guilfoyle—she’s credited in that piece above with raising $73 million, which sounds like a lot without context. But here’s the bottom line—despite working for the president of the party that represents America’s wealthiest elite, it is Joe Biden’s campaign that has raised more big-dollar checks.
And it is under her watch that GOP stalwarts like the Mercers and the Kochs have abandoned Trump, focusing instead down ballot trying to salvage what they can of the Trump-induced GOP wreckage.
3. And more grift.
This news is delicious:
[Former Trump campaign manager Brad] Parscale, reportedly called the $10 million man by Trump, has made no secret of the fact he got rich by working for Trump. He reported a monthly salary of $15,000 from the campaign but recently splashed out on a Ferrari and multiple homes. Trump’s anger apparently culminated after a report that Parscale had been running the campaign poolside from Florida. “They’re doing the full autopsy because the president is pissed,” one Republican close to the campaign and White House told Business Insider.
It was also funny hearing how the campaign spent $325,000 to promote Parscale’s Facebook page. Hilarious, right?
There’s a lot more of that where that came from, like the campaign paying an allowance to the romantic partners of both Trump sons, to the tune of $180,000 each. Don Jr’s girlfriend Guilfoyle, as we saw above, at least seems to have a job. But Eric’s wife Lara is doing … what? Who knows.
But even if Guilfoyle is working for her $15,000/month, should Trump donors really be paying for her $50,000 birthday party? Also, she apparently flies private jets everywhere she goes, and that’s not exactly economical. We don’t know how much that is costing the campaign, but consider this story from Politico’s story on chaos in her fundraising department: “In March, two staffers chose not to fly commercial and instead took the private jet of a major Trump donor to the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort for a finance event. The campaign had to reimburse the roughly $25,000 cost.”
So if one short flight from Virginia to Florida cost the campaign $25,000, how much is her regular private flights costing the campaign? “Guilfoyle herself has used private planes to travel to and from fundraisers. But people close to her argued that it amounted to a small sum given that the events often net millions of dollars,” Politico reported.
So will any of this nepotism, graft, and stupid spending end anytime soon? How could it? It’s baked into Trump’s very personality!
When we get to October, the cash race won’t even be close. Democrats will have far more money up and down the ballot to do what needs to be done to the GOP—utter and complete annihilation. Lucky for us, Trump himself is an ally in making sure they spend their money as poorly as possible.

Cotton’s so-called Saving American History Act of 2020 would punish schools that teach lessons based on “The 1619 Project” by making them ineligible for federal professional development grants.
“The New York Times’s 1619 Project is a racially divisive, revisionist account of history that denies the noble principles of freedom and equality on which our nation was founded,” Cotton wrote. “Not a single cent of federal funding should go to indoctrinate young Americans with this left-wing garbage.”
The 1619 Project is neo-Marxist propaganda. And it’s already been debunked by serious historians.
Of course it shouldn’t be taught in schools. https://t.co/abRTAoQzu3
— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) July 24, 2020
After being lambasted for his June 2020 New York Times opinion piece suggesting that the U.S. military forces should be used against racial justice protesters — an article that was later pulled for not meeting the paper’s editorial standards — Cotton wrote, “[The New York Times] is a propaganda bullhorn—a super PAC for the Democratic Party, the 1619 Project, and other revolutionary causes. Perhaps it should rebrand as The New Woke Times.”
In 2006, Cotton wrote a letter to The New York Times saying the journalists who had written an article detailing a classified government program monitoring terrorists’ finances should be prosecuted “to the fullest extent” under the Espionage Act, a law which punishes U.S. citizens helping foreign enemies. The full extent of the law allows for such people to be put to death.

So how do you retreat after making such a big show of dissing Charlotte, North Carolina, along with the Democrats who run the city and state for enforcing limits on public gatherings and mask wearing?
You make stuff up, of course.
Look at Trump’s hilariously bad spin:
Trump said on Thursday he informed his team that his focus was on protecting the American people, even though aides advised him they could make an in-person convention safe.
Actually, the local sheriff, a Republican, made very clear he couldn’t keep the convention safe. “We knew some months back that this effort was going to be a huge lift…with a timetable that was aggressive to say the least, the communication required to make the critical steps come together just never seemed to gel. And still has not,” Duval County Sheriff Mike Williams told Politico.
Meanwhile, this happened:
When Trump announced he would accept the GOP nomination in Jacksonville, it was seeing 27 new cases a day versus Charlotte’s 188. But Charlotte was mandating precautions where Jacksonville wasn’t.
And lo. https://t.co/3pB0UWVYhx pic.twitter.com/2abBhWQ0aS
— Philip Bump (@pbump) July 24, 2020
Jacksonville eventually implemented the same restrictions Charlotte originally had, rendering Trump’s dream of his unfettered, unsafe, and utterly irresponsible convention dead.
“I looked at my team and I said the timing for this event is not right. It’s just not right,” Trump said at the White House. “To have a big convention, it’s not the right time.”
Ha ha, right.
…full attendance in the Arena. In other words, we would be spending millions of dollars building the Arena to a very high standard without even knowing if the Democrat Governor would allow the Republican Party to fully occupy the space. Plans are being….

His demands for a big convention were literally the reason he picked up his ball and huffily went (to his new Florida) home. Nothing has changed since then—the pandemic was in full swing in May, and it wasn’t as if he did anything to try and help stop its spread.
“There’s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe,” Trump said.
Trump lacks even the barest hint of empathy or give-a-fuck about anyone else besides him and his daughter Ivanka. Period. He doesn’t care about keeping people safe, otherwise he wouldn’t be attacking others—like Dr. Anthony Fauci—for trying to keep people safe. Or, for that matter, the Democratic governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper.
Heck, just yesterday, Trump ran to his last friend Sean Hannity to shed tears over how mean he was treated by those dastardly Democrats. “We went to North Carolina. We wanted to do it there. It was all set,” Trump sobbed on the air. “We were going to build a beautiful facility. And it got hit hard. And the governor then, really, he could have treated us better, Democrat governor.”
Reminder: all Cooper did was refuse to waive the state’s mask and social distancing requirements, which Trump now says is justified, because, you know, “there’s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe,” right?
Nah, Trump doesn’t believe that. He’s been forced to say those words to try and save face, but when given a moment with Hannity on Fox News, he reverts to form, airing his grievances at someone for actually trying to keep people safe.

0,2020-07-26T15:18:12+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-your-field-guide-to-the-5-main-types-of-pandemic-deniers/,Here’s your field guide to the 5 main types of pandemic deniers,"Every day there is more data to prove the dangers of the coronavirus. Yet, bizarrely, the more proof we have of the damage of the pandemic; the more vicious and hysterical its deniers. It is hard not to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of uninformed, deluded ideas covidiots spew on a daily basis. We mourn not just the lives lost and the bodies damaged, but the collective intelligence of our nation. With international news consistently depicting the United States as the dumbest nation in the developed world, it is as if news of the covidiocy is almost as depressing as news of the virus’s spread itself.
The trend to what is described as America’s move from freedom to “freedumb” has sadly been a long time in the making. The pandemic only painfully reveals a process that was well-documented by Charles Pierce’s 2010 book “Idiot America: How Stupidity Became a Virtue in the Land of the Free.”
Pierce opens with a story of Americans descending on the Creation Museum in Kentucky, where homeschooled children on field trips can behold a dinosaur wearing a saddle. With stories like these it is not hard to understand how this country lost its grip on even the most basic scientific concepts. It is not a big leap from dinosaurs in saddles to believing that face masks make us sick.
Shortly before the 2016 election we started to hear that part of the problem with America’s stupidity was the fact that social media allows us to exist in information silos or echo chambers where our ideas aren’t challenged and where we get a daily dose of confirmation for our brand of personal wackiness. Surely, information silos are a problem, but as the pandemic deniers have shown, there is actually a fairly diverse array of covidiocy types.
In fact, when we lump all pandemic deniers together into the same pile, we miss the fact that what plagues America on a cognitive level is a far more serious disease, one that has neither one symptom nor one easy cure. Here are five main types of covidiots to look out for:
The Eye Rollers
The eye rollers think that all of the news over the pandemic is exaggerated hype. This is the line of reasoning that suggests that if we didn’t test for the virus so well, our numbers would be more in line with other developed nations. The eye rollers think that the coronavirus is just like the flu and that its mortality rates are of no real significance.
You’d think all you’d need to do with an eye roller is show them the inside of an ICU or have them hear stories from those who have been gravely sickened by the virus. But the key to the eye roller is that they aren’t going to believe a single piece of evidence because, from their view, all proof of the dangers of the pandemic is manufactured to produce hysteria.
The eye roller is disturbing for the fact that they have a long history of not taking a single critical issue in this nation seriously. So, coupled with their eye rolling over what they perceive as coronavirus hype, they are also likely to believe that we have no racism, no sexism, in fact, no significant problems whatsoever.  For them, liberals manufacture issues that aren’t real so that they can create social anxiety and elevate their policy platform. These are the people who disparage the Black Lives Matter movement as reverse racism and mock #MeToo as a problem of thin skin.
The Shoulder Shruggers
The shoulder shruggers are your Ayn Rand-style covidiots. These folks get the numbers and the science. They have a full sense of the dead bodies and damaged lungs, but they simply don’t care. They epitomize the “profit over people” worldview.
This is the line of reasoning we saw on display by Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick who suggested that grandparents should be willing to die in order to save the economy for their grandkids: “My message: let’s get back to work, let’s get back to living, let’s be smart about it, and those of us who are 70-plus, we’ll take care of ourselves.” According to him, there is no reason to “sacrifice the country” in order to save a few old people.
Like the eye rollers, the shoulder shruggers have a far more pernicious mindset that shapes their views on a wider set of concerns than the virus. These are the folks who see in the virus neoliberal opportunities to capitalize rather than empathize.
The Narcissistic Hedonists
The hedonists simply don’t want to be inconvenienced by the virus. They want their manicures, haircuts and happy hours. Their own selfishness dominates their behavior and clouds their ability to consider the wellbeing of others. They see the entire world from the vantage point of their pleasure-driven egos and they outright refuse to be inconvenienced for the benefit of others.
The narcissistic hedonists talk about how they have a right not to wear a mask and how those who worry over the pandemic should just stay home. “You’re infringing on my rights,” they scream any time they are told they can’t enter a store without a mask. “This is a free country, and I’m here to shop.”
The narcissistic hedonists have no commitment to a social project nor do they care a wit about the common good. They have weighed the costs and risks of their behavior and they think that their own desires are more valuable than their grandparents’ lives.
This strain of covidiot also has a long history in this nation. Unlike the eye roller who thinks everything in the nation is already great or the shoulder shrugger who cares more about the economy than society, the narcissistic hedonist places their desires at the center of everything. And, even worse, they think that their own destructive ego-driven behavior is their “right” as Americans.
The Self-Proclaimed Scientists
The self-proclaimed scientists are a unique strain of covidiot that derives from this nation’s long resistance to expertise. The self-proclaimed scientist will tell you that you should not listen to Dr. Anthony Fauci. Instead you should listen to them, since they have done “research” and they know more about the virus than world-leading scientists.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently warned of the dangerous consequences of our national anti-science bias: “One of the problems we face in the United States is that unfortunately, there is a combination of an anti-science bias that people are — for reasons that sometimes are, you know, inconceivable and not understandable — they just don’t believe science and they don’t believe authority.”
Yet, as Pierce documents in the book I cited earlier, the American tendency to eschew expertise and disparage science has extremely deep roots in our collective history. It is tied not just to religious extremism, but also to the history of anti-intellectualism in the U.S. The urge to put down teachers and professors alongside scientists is part of the American habit of distrusting smart people and it is tied to the idea that some folks would prefer a president they want to have a beer with over an intellectual or even highly educated president.
The anti-expertise sickness that plagues the United States is sadly to blame for much of the failed U.S. response to the pandemic, but its negative impact on the functioning of our nation goes well beyond flaws in our healthcare system and public health policy. As long as we continue to be skeptical of knowledge and attracted to BS, we can expect our nation to continue to look less and less like a developed nation.
The Conspiracy Theorists
One of the special features of conspiracy theorists is that they are found on both the left and the right, unlike a lot of the other strains of covidiots. They converge in the bizarre alternate reality of anti-vaxxers. But, regarding the coronavirus, the conspiracy theories are largely skewed to the right.
The range of conspiracy theories about the pandemic is simply too broad to cover in this piece.  It spans from theories that the virus was deliberately started by China or by Bill Gates to theories that the virus simply isn’t real at all. Nature reported in March that “the website Biohackinfo.com falsely claimed that Gates planned to use a coronavirus vaccine as a ploy to monitor people through an injected microchip or quantum-dot spy software.”
Healthline reported in June that 25 percent of people believe unproven theories about COVID-19. This is all to show that there is a strange urge in this country to attach to fantasy theories rather than facts.
The danger to the conspiracy theorist is not just their refusal to accept evidence that challenges their views, but rather their paranoid worries that any evidence is actually propaganda designed to dupe them and cause harm. The conspiracy theorist is so worried thinking that information is manipulation that they lose any sight of what the truth actually is. And as coverage of a Palm Beach County Commission meeting that went viral for the outlandish arguments presented by residents against a mask ordinance (which the Florida county did pass) shows, covidiots tend to mix up their reasons for refusing to wear masks and take the pandemic seriously. Trying to follow these arguments against wearing masks will hurt your brain.
What’s worse is that having to “debate” matters of science and evidence-based medicine tends to leave us fighting each other rather than the virus. Even more disturbing, there is no vaccine for covidiocy: It promises to linger well after the virus has been contained, wreaking havoc on our society, taking up resources and frustrating progress. It’s a condition that has plagued our country for decades and it won’t be cured until and unless we make a collective effort to prevent its spread.

During an interview with Mnuchin on Fox News Sunday, Wallace noted that Trump had recently threatened to veto a COVID-19 stimulus bill “that did not include a payroll tax cut.”
“That now is gone from all the discussions,” Wallace explained. “Why did the administration cave on that so quickly?”
Mnuchin immediately blamed the omission on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who are both Democrats.
“The Democrats were not going to give us a payroll tax cut,” the Treasury secretary opined.
Wallace interrupted: “Sir, to be fair, it wasn’t just Democrats. There were a number of Republicans who rejected this.”
The Fox News host pointed to GOP Senators John Thune (SD), John Cornyn (TX) and Chuck Grassley (IA) as three examples.
“They all said they had no interest in that,” Wallace continued. “So, you’ve gotten blowback, not just from Democrats, but from some top Republicans as well.”
“There are other Republicans that supported it,” Mnuchin replied. “We have the direct payments, and as you know, the direct payments are a much quicker way of effectively giving everybody a tax cut and it’s much quicker than the payroll tax cut.”

While the Cook Political Report still has Texas as a “lean red” state in its 2020 Electoral College Ratings, a Quinnipiac poll released last week showed former Vice President Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump 45% to 44% among registered voters. And according to the Houston Chronicle, a decisive number of anti-Trump Republicans could be contributing to Biden’s lead in the state.
Jacob Monty, an immigration attorney in Houston, became a Republican years ago — attributing his party affiliation to an affection for the Bush family.
“I never had to apologize for them,” Monty told the Chronicle. “I always felt welcome. I never had to explain, ‘Oh, what Bush meant was …’”
“It was very easy to be a Republican,” he said. Now, he worries Trump’s impact on the party’s agenda will doom the future of the Grand Old Party.
“His whole persona is white nationalism,” Monty said of Trump “He’s not going to ever adopt the mainstream Republican position. What’s scary is there is no mainstream Republican position, because he’s kind of co-opted the party.”
Monty briefly served on Trump’s National Hispanic Advisory Council in 2016, but left in August, before Trump was elected to office.
“The fundamental policies that make people a Republican — American exceptionalism, limited government, free trade, free enterprise — no one’s talking about those,” Monty told the Chronicle. “Those aren’t Trump values, for sure.”
Abel Guerra, who works with Monty on The Lincoln Project’s Texas leadership team, argued “Trump has been emboldened to normalize bigotry and use it as a strategy for his benefit.”
“It is our duty to stop him“ Guerra said.

0,2020-07-26T13:19:49+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/ralph-nader-the-feds-callous-indifference-to-the-real-economy-will-imperil-struggling-americans/,Ralph Nader: The Fed’s callous indifference to the real economy will imperil struggling Americans,"The Federal Reserve Board—our unaccountable Central Bank—needs more citizen and congressional supervision. Fees from financial institutions fund its operations, not congressional appropriations. It is as secret as it wants to be and that’s plenty. (See Secrets of the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country by William Greider). Plus, the Fed can print money at will. In the past several years it has “produced” trillions of dollars that juiced the stock market’s speculation.
Back nearly 90 years ago, the influential British economist, John Maynard Keynes, warned about stock markets veering into speculation and away from investments to build the real economy. Today, he might view stock markets as the epitome of wasteful “casino capitalism.” They have very little to do with raising money for useful investments and everything to do with making bets, as in multi-tiered derivatives, puts, and options to make money from money. Most often using, in Justice Louis Brandeis’s phrase, “other people’s money,” the Wall Street gamblers reap lucrative fees from unproductive speculation.
Fed Chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has chosen to instill “confidence” in the stock markets and credit markets by injecting trillions of dollars into the financial system to reassure the Wall Street speculators that the Covid-19 pandemic won’t crash the money markets into chaos and bankruptcies.
But Powell, the Fed, and the bankers who dominate the Fed and its regional branches have set the stage for this constant bailout of reckless bubbles and debt binges. By keeping interest rates too low, now near zero, they have encouraged non-financial companies to go deeper and deeper into riskier debt ($6.8 trillion and surging). Borrowing has been so cheap that some of this debt was incurred by companies just to buy back their stock! Stock buybacks do not produce anything but higher metrics for executive compensation (See article, “Why Stock Buybacks Are Dangerous for the Economy” by William Lazonick).
Powell has turned a deaf ear to tens of millions of Americans, with modest incomes, who together have trillions of dollars in money market and bank savings accounts and are getting almost nothing by way of interest income. The result is less consumer spending. Yet Powell arrogantly says he’s not even thinking about raising interest rates even to one percent. Lenders like this approach because the sky-high interest rates they charge are not regulated.
Meanwhile, this huge pile of money looking for some return on investment is being lured into the stock market further driving up price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios into nosebleed territory.
Powell shrugs and assures the big boys on Wall Street that the Fed will have their back without limits. In return, the corporations continue their unproductive speculation and what the New York Times called a Fed-driven “debt binge.”
To make matters worse, these trillions of dollars are chasing fewer listed companies on the stock exchanges. Mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and raising money from cheap debt instead of equity, over the past 25 years have cut the number of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange by half.
Note how little all these financial machinations directly help the average families in America. More money is controlled by the few than ever before, but little is going into productive investments in the creation of jobs and services sorely needed in this, shaky “real economy.”
Some economists have written that “the stock markets are not the economy.” True enough if they are describing how stocks can soar on Wall Street while the Main Street economy plummets. Unfortunately, few economists focus on the stock market speculators sucking money belonging to the people (pension and mutual funds) into the speculation vortex while corporate bosses borrow cheap money, at record low-interest rates, for self-serving unproductive uses.
The Fed is pursuing a short-term game of guaranteeing corporations against self-imposed riskiness (the Fed is even starting to buy corporate bonds). This authoritarian Central Bank, with its own bulging red ink balance sheet, is turning its massive injections of “liquidity” into a narcotic for Big Business.
Such addictions hurt many innocent people back home trying to keep jobs, find jobs, and pay their bills. The House Democrats must hold rigorous public hearings on the Fed which ironically is demanding that Congress provide more immediate relief for ordinary people.
In May the House Democrats passed a $3 trillion package addressing these needs and sent the bill to a balking Republican-controlled Senate.
Now it is time for various House Committees to publicly question Chairman Powell about the costs of the Fed’s callous indifference to the real economy and struggling Americans.

For the last three months, Rapert has been sharing articles on his social media about how “liberal quacks” are “spreading fear” about coronavirus, about how COVID-19 is the “biggest political hoax in history” and about how the recent face mask mandate ordered by Republican Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson is “draconian” and an “overreach of executive power.”
Though Rapert has occasionally mentioned the importance of using masks, he’s now in the hospital being treated for coronavirus and pneumonia.
“We have all been doing our best to wear a mask, social distance and be careful like everyone else,” Rapert wrote in a statement on Thursday. “This virus is serious and can attack anyone regardless of age or general health…”
Rapert also has a reputation for being a Christianist who introduced a bill seeking to ban gay marriage nationwide in 2017, two years after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriages nationwide. He also  wanted to defund PBS in February 2020 because gay actor Billy Porter appeared on Sesame Street.
On Wednesday and Thursday of this week, Arkansas had its second and third highest-ever daily tolls of newly confirmed coronavirus cases, at 1,013 and 990 new cases, respectively.
Here are some Twitter reactions to his contracting COVID-19.

Following the “Blue wave” 2018 midterm election that resulted in the Republican Party losing control of the House, McCarthy has been attempting to stop the bleeding in 2020 in what is expected to be a high-turnout election with an embattled Donald Trump at the top of the ticket.
The report notes that McCarthy has asked the RNC which is flush with cash for a check for the National Republican Congressional Committee multiple times, only to be given a cold shoulder as the RNC focuses on keeping Trump in office.
The roadblock for the frustrated McCarthy reportedly is Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
“McCarthy specifically has asked Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, to make a financial commitment to the House GOP, according to several officials familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe private conversations,” the report states. “But Kushner, who oversees such decisions and has a greater say than RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, has refused thus far, the officials say. While the Trump campaign and the RNC have brought in record amounts of money, some Trump officials see donating to the House as a wasteful investment as the GOP’s chances of reclaiming the majority sharply deteriorate.”
According to one White House insider, Trump and his advisors regard the House as a lost cause unable to overcome their minority status and are hoarding the money to salvage the president’s re-election.
“The campaign just wants the money. . . . They don’t care about the House — it’s not their concern,” the official stated. “When you’ve been working in politics for years, and you understand it’s a team sport, you kind of look at these things a little differently. I don’t think they see it that way.”
According to the report, House Republicans are furious with Kushner, “many of whom believe the president has a duty to help the party — not just himself,” particularly because some Republican House members in safe seats have forwarded donations in the tens of thousands of dollars to the RNC at the request of the president’s campaign officials.
Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-IL), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Republicans have only themselves to blame.
“Washington Republicans have learned the hard way that encouraging people to drink bleach doesn’t make for the most effective fundraising pitch,” she said before adding, “House Democrats have outworked, out-hustled and outraised Republicans all cycle long. Our fundraising advantage is the firewall protecting our majority.”

It controls over 190 television stations in over 100 market areas. Since taking control of those stations, Sinclair has often forced them to run conservative commentary, often embedded into local news programming. Those local news programs have also been remodeled on many stations, forced to present a viewpoint that mirrors the ultra right wing position of Sinclair’s principal owners.
Among the programs that appears on Sinclair stations is a segment called “America This Week” hosted by frequent Fox News commentator Eric Bolling. In the segment that’s airing this week across the nation, Bolling interviews discredited researcher Judy Mikovits, the central figure in the conspiracy theory film Plandemic. Mikovits’ woo-filled statements include claims that: The virus behind COVID-19 was man-made; hospitals are being bribed to over-report COVID-19 deaths;  wearing a mask “activates your own virus”; and that getting a flu shot not only increases the odds of catching COVID-19, but “If you’ve ever had a flu vaccine, you were injected with coronaviruses.”
But what’s even more upsetting than this stack of information is the chyron that runs though the whole segment, because what it suggests that Dr. Anthony Fauci created the virus.

Sinclair has put the brakes on this broadcast. It seems like there might be someone who doesn’t have complete faith in Eric Bolling’s team.
After further review, we have decided to delay this episode’s airing. We will spend the coming days bringing together other viewpoints and provide additional context. All stations have been notified not to air this and will instead be re-airing last week’s episode in its place.
— Sinclair Broadcast Group (@WeAreSinclair) July 25, 2020
It would be hard for anyone with any kind of medical training, scientific knowledge, or plain common sense to take Mikovits seriously, as her statements wander into how beachgoers don’t catch the virus because of “healing microbes” and just strolling on the sand can protect people because of “sequences.” Which are not a thing.
But even people who never saw Mikovits’ original propaganda piece are spouting watered-down versions of Plandemic’s statements that have been widely shared through social media. Often, unsurprisingly, by some of the same people who support the QAnon conspiracy.
As CNN reports, during Bolling’s interview with Mikovits, the ex-researcher insists that the SARS-CoV-2 virus didn’t really originate in China. Instead, she claims that for a decade Dr. Fauci has “manufactured” viruses and shipped them to a lab in Wuhan, China. Attorney Larry Klayman, who appears on the same program, also insists that the “origins of the coronavirus” are in the United States.
Bolling then follows up with Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier, and while the two do express doubt that Fauci cooked up the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they also go on speculate about its origins with repeated references to the virus being “man-made within a laboratory.”
When questioned about the interview, Bolling denied that he had seen Plandemic or even knew about it before he booked Mikovits for his show, but says he doesn’t “second guess his bookers.”

Trump bowed to that reality this week, suddenly re-upping White House coronavirus task force briefings and abruptly canceling his precious in-person GOP convention scheduled for next month in Jacksonville, Florida.
Trump’s repeated failures to outwit science followed by his patent admissions of those failures have now cast his aggressive push for reopening the nation’s schools in the purest of Machiavellian terms. In short: Trump’s track record on placing the health of the American people above his own political fortunes stinks, and that has not been lost on the country’s parents, teachers, and school communities.
In an AP/NORC poll this week, fully 80% of respondents—including more than 3 in 5 Republicans—said they were either extremely or somewhat concerned that reopening schools this fall will lead to new outbreaks in their communities. And just 1 in 10 Americans said daycare centers, preschools, and K-12 schools should reopen without restrictions.
“School shouldn’t even be considered right now,” Patty Kasbek, a 40-year-old Oklahoma mom of two school-aged children, told the AP. Kasbek expressed a deep desire to return her kids to school but added, “We need to get this under control before we play with the virus. It’s just too dangerous to put our kids out there like guinea pigs.”
That’s about the shape of things, and pollsters are finding similar concerns among parents of all socioeconomic levels—regardless of how badly they want to get the economy up and running, writes The New York Times.  “I have yet to see any data where there are appreciable numbers of people who say, ‘Yes, I want my kids back in school,’” said veteran GOP pollster Glen Bolger. “They want their kids back in school, but not right now.”
Yet, once again, Trump is plowing ahead on “gut” instinct, ignoring all the warning signs along the way. That hasn’t worked out well for him in the past, nor has it worked out well for America.
And Trump’s obstinance—not to mention his massive failings on the virus—have given opponent Joe Biden a wide lead on the issue in national polling. Last week’s ABC News/Washington Post poll found that roughly two-thirds of the country distrusts Trump on the pandemic, an issue on which Biden consistently outpolls him.
More generally, the same poll found Biden holds a double-digit lead among Americans on who “better understands the problems of people like you,” 52% to 35%. And the more Trump pushes for school reopenings without widespread support from medical experts and education professionals, the less trustworthy he will seem.

0,2020-07-26T12:12:38+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/guess-which-two-states-have-the-most-newly-unemployed-hint-its-the-two-worst-governors/,Guess which 2 states have the most newly unemployed. Hint: It’s the 2 worst governors,"There are a lot of awful Republican governors in this country, with only a handful (in Maryland and Massachusetts) taking the coronavirus pandemic seriously from the start. But most have been forced to reverse course in the face of this new wave of infections, even in places like Arizona and Texas, with the Trumpiest governors. Yet two states stand out in their continued refusal to acknowledge the dangers of the pandemic.
Guess which two states just reported the worst job numbers?
In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis refuses to shut Florida down despite leading the nation in new cases and deaths. “We’re not rolling back,” DeSantis said. “The negative effects of that would far exceed any gains you’re getting. You have to have society function.” This is what’s happening in Florida:
But, DeSantis says, “society has to function.”
Much the same is happening in Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp isn’t just refusing to close the state down, but is suing municipalities (like Atlanta) that have done so locally. “It was never to keep our economy shut down until the virus is gone,” he said. “And if the virus comes back, I don’t see us shutting down our economy anymore. We’ve got to figure out how to live with the virus.”
Meanwhile, a lot of people aren’t living anymore because of the virus:
These two governors really don’t care about those deaths, and in fact, have echoed impeached bunker baby’s desperate pleas to endangers kids by forcing them back in school. At the root of those efforts is the idea that shutting the state down would harm its economy, and thus by extension, harm Trump’s reelection chances. That’s it. These ghouls literally want people to die to help Trump get reelected.
Yet their sick approach is predicated on the notion that the economy is better off open and infected, than closed. It was the same theory that motivated Sweden to stay open for business even as the rest of Europe shut down. Yet it didn’t work for Sweden—it sports among the highest per capita death rates in the world, and its economy is expected to fare the worse in the European Union. It turns out, economies can’t function when people see each other as potential vectors of death. And that’s despite the fact that Sweden has one of the strongest social safety nets in the world, one of the top health care systems in the world, and has about half of its population living alone. None of those things are true of Florida or Georgia. Quite the opposite, in fact.
So it should come as no surprise when the Bureau of Labor announced its latest weekly jobs report late last week on July 23, for the week that ended July 11. Here are the top three states with the most newly unemployed:
UNADJUSTED INITIAL CLAIMS FOR WEEK ENDED JULY 11, 2020
FLORIDA +65.890
GEORGIA +33,292
CALIFORNIA +20.123
California is getting hammered, in large part, thanks to the idiotic decisions by Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to allow bars to reopen. Northern California, which never reopened, has been quiet. It’s freakin’ SoCal that is driving those numbers and, likely, those newly unemployed.
But look at the top two—Florida and Georgia are handily winning the unenviable race for most newly unemployed. It’s not even close.
As much as Trump and his Trumpiest governor allies want to pretend otherwise, economies cannot function in pandemic conditions. The number of deplorable waving American flags and screaming “FREEDOM” over wearing face masks aren’t enough to support normal economic activity. And the more people get infected, get sick, and die, the more people will stay home and hoard resources—especially since Republicans in Washington D.C. are stalling on extending emergency assistance and further stimuli.
The irony, of course, is that those governors think that keeping things open (and trying to force kids into Covid-incubating schools) help Trump out, when the mass of newly sick, dead, and unemployed is doing the exact opposite. In Florida, only 40% of registered voters approve of the federal pandemic response, and in Georgia, it’s just 41%. Those numbers are a big reason that both those states are looking like great Democratic pickup opportunities this November. And there’s certainly no indication that Trump or his local allies have hit rock-bottom. With a rising death toll and more economic devastation, it’s easy to see how Trump’s standing (and that of down-ballot Republicans) will only continue to worsen.
Closing down a state is economically painful. Definitely. But keeping it open is only more so. How many times do we need to keep learning this lesson before conservative ideologues finally get it?

Susan Collins, the Republican from Maine who is in the top 10 of seniority in her party, says she’s really “hopeful” that maybe the coronavirus relief package Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to negotiate among his squabbling conference will have critical assistance for state and local governments. It doesn’t right now, which tells you just about how much sway Susan Collins has in her party.
Back in May, Collins actually sponsored a bill to spend $500 billion in direct aid to state and local governments. Clearly that had a big impact on McConnell. There’s none in the package he floated this week, just money for reopening schools. Just to put a fine point on this, that’s $70 billion to K-12 schools—half of which has to go to schools that have reopened—and another $30 billion to colleges and universities, which is not tied to reopening. There is no money at all for the state, local, tribal, and territorial governments that have seen revenues plummet in the past five months. Layoffs of public service workers have been happening all over the country. There will be more.
Collins said she talked McConnell about it, and that the Republican caucus is “really split” on the issue because not all of the previous spending for states has been spent—in part because there’s little flexibility in where it can be spent. The states still have the need for funds that they can use to replace revenue, but that doesn’t matter to a core group of Republicans. The ones who are winning with McConnell. Collins says that “doesn’t decrease the need for those who are at the municipal level.” That argument clearly didn’t have a lot of sway with her boss.
“I think a component of local aid is very important,” Collins said to reporters in Maine. “I’m hopeful that that will be included in the package.” Collins’ hopes and $1.25 will get you, well, very little. Maine has a projected $525 million budget shortfall in the next year. So a helluva lot of good her concerns and hopes are doing her home state.

0,2020-07-26T12:08:34+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/louisiana-democrats-land-rising-star-to-challenge-republican-senator-this-fall/,Louisiana Democrats land rising star to challenge Republican senator this fall,"Louisiana Democrats got a credible candidate to take on Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy on Wednesday when Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins announced that he would run. Perkins, who would be the state’s first Black senator, kicked off his campaign with an introductory video highlighting his impressive resume and quickly received an endorsement from former Sen. Mary Landrieu, who lost reelection to Cassidy in 2014.
Candidate filing closes on Friday, and it’s unlikely that any other notable names will enter the race. All the contenders will face off on one ballot on Nov. 3, which is the same day as the presidential election; if no one takes a majority of the vote, the top two candidates, regardless of party, would advance to a Dec. 5 runoff.
Louisiana, which backed Donald Trump 58-38, has become a very rough state for most Democrats over the last decade, and Cassidy is very much the favorite to win a second term. Still, Perkins gives his party a candidate with a compelling backstory and a geographic base of support. Perkins, like Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, completed West Point’s intense Army Ranger training, and he went on to serve three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. Perkins obtained the rank of captain, and he was also decorated with a Bronze Star.
Perkins returned home to Shreveport after his military service, and in 2018 he challenged Mayor Ollie Tyler, a fellow Democrat. Perkins, who was a first-time candidate, entered the contest with little name recognition. However, as the Shreveport Times would write, he proved to be a strong campaigner and fundraiser, and he took first place against Tyler and six other opponents in the all-party primary.
Perkins, who at 33 was 40 years younger than Tyler, portrayed himself as an agent of change for Louisiana’s third-largest city. Tyler, by contrast, didn’t do much campaigning; she also raised considerably less money than her opponent. The paper added that the incumbent struggled to convince voters she could deal with violent crime, especially after she hesitated to remove an unpopular police chief. Ultimately Perkins ended up unseating Taylor in the runoff in a 64-36 landslide.
While Perkins demonstrated two years ago that he can run a strong race, he’s going to be in a considerably more difficult contest than Cassidy in this red state. The senator ended June with $6 million in the bank, while Perkins will be starting from scratch with only about three-and-a-half months to go before Election Day.
Perkins also likely will begin this race with little statewide name recognition. Only 12% of the state’s residents live in the Shreveport media market, so most Louisianians won’t have seen much of Perkins on TV during his tenure as mayor. Additionally, Shreveport, which is located in the northwest corner of the state near the Texas border, is located quite a ways away from Louisiana’s larger population centers. It takes around four hours to drive from Perkins’ community southeast to the state capitol of Baton Rouge, and at least an additional hour to reach New Orleans.
If Perkins is to pull off a victory, he’ll likely need to recreate the coalition that allowed Edwards to win reelection as governor by a 51-49 margin last year against Republican Eddie Rispone. Edwards benefited from high turnout among African American voters in and around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Perkins’ Shreveport.
The governor also did very well in the state’s well-educated suburbs, including Jefferson Parish, a large and historically Republican area just outside of New Orleans. And while Rispone still won most of the state’s rural areas, he didn’t perform nearly as well as Republicans usually do there.
Perkins will need a lot to go right for his campaign, and for a lot to go wrong for Cassidy, in order to make this close, especially with Trump at the top of the ticket. Still, as we always say, Democrats should run viable contenders in longshot races in case something unexpected happens, and Perkins now gives Team Blue a credible candidate here.

We need to talk about it","I was reading a community diary story today that you really should read, if you haven’t already, about the writer’s experience taking the cognitive assessment test. I have had difficulty processing Donald Trump’s answer regarding this matter to Fox News in a way that I hadn’t really come to terms with until reading that diary and thinking about how it made me feel.
I had my first MOCA test years after rehab recovering from a violent crime assault, and, unfortunately, since then for the past 25 years, I’ve had a version of this test given to me with decreasing regularity. The point of a cognitive test isn’t to “ace” it or prove how much of a smart person you are: The point is to track whether or not you are experiencing a negative trend in your ability to function, which can be caused by time, disability, or even medication. As the president bragged about his test results, one question kept popping up: Why brag? This test is easy. Only once, due to a bad drug interaction, did I ever suffer difficulties. It was that one time, though, that was a clue to doctors around me that something was wrong, resulting in changes to my medication. A follow-up test showed me, I guess in Trump’s terms, “acing the test” with “unbelievable” results. I don’t know if I would call them unbelievable, because they were to be expected. At the time of my traumatic brain injury (TBI), the MoCA didn’t exist. Still, the goal of neurologists was the same. It wasn’t to determine if I was smart—it was to determine if brain trauma was having a degenerative effect, or if the damage had stopped.
Trump’s follow-up, commenting about remembering names and information given to him at the beginning of the test through the end, has absolutely nothing at all to do with intelligence. Doctors give that test to think about retention. For people who have experienced traumatic brain injury (like me), it is to make sure that you still retain the information that comes in, and that you retain it well. It doesn’t, in any way, signal your intelligence.
I thought about the post I read, and I thought about my experiences with the MOCA test. I reached out to a neurologist I have worked with, and read back through all of the paperwork I have, and, frankly, the only reason I was ever told I would need to take a MOCA wasn’t due to my fitness or mental fitness: It was to check the impact of a TBI and to make sure it was stable. When I go in for a physical, it isn’t a component. In fact, the only time I have had to do a follow-up MOCA has been when I have had adverse reactions to medication or if I cross a five-year check-in, and then we do it.
I checked online to see if anyone else experienced the same with the MOCA test, and I am apparently not alone. The Washington Post talked to the creator of the test:
“It’s not meant to measure IQ or intellectual skill in anyway,” said Ziad Nasreddine, the neurologist who created the test. “If someone performs well, what it means is they can be ruled out for cognitive impairment that comes with diseases like Alzheimer’s, stroke or multiple sclerosis. That’s it.”
Nasreddine continued: “The reason most people take the test is they or others start noticing mental decline. They forgot where they parked the car, can’t remember what groceries to buy by the time they get to the store. They keep forgetting to take their medication.”
As Trump bragged about the test, something gnawed at me. I would listen to him talk about how he aced it and how great he was, and how it proved he was smart. The last time I took a MOCA test was last year, and as I said, I, too, “aced it.” For people who have TBI, though, we live with a bit of fear. It’s been more than 20 years, so I should be completely stable at this point. Still, every time I lose my keys, forget where I parked, or lose track of time—all of which happen to everyone—it sparks a little fear in us: Could this be the moment where things start to slip away from me?
For people who live in fear of neurological issues, whether it is Alzheimer’s, a stroke, a TBI, or any other issue, the idea of bragging about this test is ghastly. It is a struggle people with disabilities deal with, and it can establish their comfort. Trump reports that he got a score of 30/30. Fantastic. Great. Please realize who you are being compared to and why. I guess if you are intent on insulting all Americans, why stop anywhere? Just keep bragging about how much better you are than everyone else.
P.S.: I know someone who suffered a brutal brain injury who took a test like this and had a 25 score they were damn proud to have in their name. I haven’t seen them in a long time, but I can guarantee you, I would trust his judgment far above yours, Mr. President.

July 24, 2020
“Texas Republicans face tough 2020 election after a rocky 12 months” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.
John Cornyn had an important message for Texas Republicans.
“I’ll be blunt — because I know I’m among friends here,” the U.S. senator told delegates to the virtual state GOP convention last weekend. “Republicans are facing the greatest electoral challenge we’ve faced in the last five decades.”
There was one problem with Cornyn’s speech, though: Delegates could not entirely hear it. The convention livestream was cutting back and forth every few seconds between Cornyn and a committee meeting that was happening at the same time.
It was one more technical mishap for a convention that was full of them. But Cornyn’s obscured warning was also thick with irony: As Texas Republicans prepare for their most important election in a long time, new problems seem to keep getting in the way, making an already challenging road to November even rockier.
Democrats had made it known since the beginning of this election cycle that Texas would be a top battleground for them, and this time last year, the state’s Republicans had ample reason to be optimistic. They had just come off a state legislative session that was light on intraparty conflict and heavy on the kind of policy achievements — property tax reform, public education funding — that they could sell to general election voters.
But in the months since, the party has had to weather a series of unwelcome distractions, from the scandal that brought down state House Speaker Dennis Bonnen up through the disastrous convention that saw the ouster of state GOP Chairman James Dickey. Now Texas Republicans are embarking on a general election clouded by President Donald Trump’s polling collapse nationally and an intractable pandemic that has bruised even the state’s most popular GOP leader, Gov. Greg Abbott.
“I think all campaigns are moving forward right now with caution knowing that there’s a lot hanging over our heads,” said Jordan Berry, a Texas GOP consultant, pointing to a “global pandemic, media often misrepresenting the situation, small businesses being closed and a general feeling that we’re on the wrong track.”
“I don’t think it’s any one thing,” Berry added. “I think it’s a combination of things, but it’s better that we know it now so we can find ways to correct than finding this out in mid-October.”
Some Texas Republicans have a blunter assessment. George Seay, a Dallas businessman and longtime Texas GOP fundraiser, said the state is becoming more competitive earlier than it should be because Texas Republicans, much like the Democrats who controlled the state before them, became “fat, happy, lazy and bored” — as well as consumed by internecine feuding.
“I think that if Democrats are successful, it won’t be because Texas suddenly got really liberal,” Seay said. “It will be because normal Texans who don’t pay attention to this will be sick and tired of Republican mediocrity at best.”
The month-to-month distractions started with the secret recording scandal that forced Bonnen into retirement — and sidelined a speaker who was set to play a leading role in defending the House GOP majority. Bookending the period was the convention, which the party struggled mightily to pull off virtually after its all-out push for an in-person gathering failed in the courts. But in between, public relations nightmares persisted — a state representative who complained his primary challengers were running against him because they were Asian, a spate of county party chairs who spread conspiracy theories about George Floyd’s death on Facebook, a podcast outtake in which staffers for the hard-right group Empower Texans joked about Abbott’s wheelchair use and disparaged him with profanity.
While Republicans doubt those episodes will be top of mind for voters in November, they nonetheless have given Democrats plenty of fodder and inhibited party unity during a cycle that demands it.
By contrast, things have generally gone the right way for Texas Democrats in recent months. With a national spotlight shining bright on them, they have been able to drive a narrative that they are mostly on offense, from the presidential race on down, and have mostly kept intraparty squabbling confined to individual races.
Texas Republicans are not without their own bright spots. After a 2018 wake-up call, they say their candidates are more attuned than ever to not taking anything for granted, and Cornyn’s battle-ready campaign has especially heartened GOP operatives. They have put a renewed emphasis on nuts-and-bolts party functions like voter registration and candidate recruitment. And in many of their battleground seats, the candidates preferred by national and state GOP leaders as the most viable made it out of their primaries and runoffs.
Plus, Republicans have all the built-in advantages that continue to make Texas a red state on paper — control of every statewide office and majorities in the congressional delegation and at the Texas Legislature. While Democrats have made inroads over the past two election cycles, the last time a Democrat won statewide was 1994.
Regardless of the Texas GOP’s best-laid plans, though, Trump looms over everything — and perilously so. While he won Texas by 9 percentage points in 2016 — the smallest margin for a Republican presidential nominee in the state since 1996 — he appears headed for a narrower win this fall — or the once unfathomable: becoming the first Republican presidential nominee to lose the state since 1976.
Virtually every Texas poll since Biden emerged as the presumptive nominee has found him within the margin of error with Trump, including a Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday that gave Biden a 1-percentage-point lead.
“This is a real race,” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz said during his speech at the state GOP convention.
Trump’s campaign remains upbeat in its Texas prospects, confident that its organization in the state is far superior and skeptical that Biden will ultimately make a genuine play for the state. Biden’s campaign launched its first general-election TV ads in the state last week, and while they marked a notable and relatively early investment, the size of the buy was not remotely close to what it would take to seriously compete this fall in Texas.
In a statement for this story, Trump Victory spokesperson Samantha Cotten said the president’s reelection effort is “lightyears ahead of Joe Biden and Democrat’s non-existent campaign in the Lone Star State.” And during a state-of-race briefing Friday with reporters, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien dismissed the idea that Texas was in play, taunting Democrats over their growing optimism about the state.
“I would love — I would invite the Biden campaign — to play in Texas,” Stepien said. “They should play hard. They should go after Texas really, really heavily, spend a lot of money in the Dallas and Houston media markets. … I’ll even buy their first ad.”
While few Republican operatives have reached the point of openly warning that Trump could lose Texas, they are increasingly concerned about his margin of victory — and whether it will be enough to prevent a down-ballot disaster. The Texas House majority is on the line — a crucial fight ahead of the 2021 redistricting process — and national Democrats are pushing to flip seven U.S. House seats in the state.
Seay called Trump’s down-ballot effect his “No. 1 concern, big time.”
Cornyn’s campaign helps with some of the heartburn. Determined to avoid Cruz’s closer-than-expected 2018 race, Cornyn began building out his reelection campaign within weeks after that election, and he has since amassed a $14.5 million war chest. He has led potential Democratic opponents by comfortable margins in every poll this year, and the Democratic nominee against him, MJ Hegar, had to go through a protracted nominating process and is vastly underfunded by comparison.
Still, Cornyn has shown little separation from Trump — who endorsed him early in the cycle — and regularly registers in polls as unknown to a significant amount of voters for someone who has been holding or running for elected office in Texas since the 1980s. That continues to give hope to Democrats, even as Hegar remains in an uphill battle.
Most of the action, though, lies further down the ballot.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting seven U.S. House districts here and has named five of the nominees in those districts to its Red to Blue program for top contenders. Democrats also have to defend the two seats they picked up in 2018 — held by Reps. Colin Allred of Dallas and Lizzie Pannill Fletcher of Houston — though they believe the rapidly changing political terrain in each district and the strength of the incumbents make them well positioned for reelection.
While some GOP incumbents, like Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, have earned recognition for making early preparations to run the race of their lives, the situation is clearly more dire in other Republican-held seats, especially when it comes to fundraising. In three of the seats the DCCC is working to flip, Democrats already have vastly more cash on hand than their Republican opponents, two of whom had to get through runoffs. In one extreme case — the 22nd Congressional District — Democratic nominee Sri Preston Kulkarni has more than 40 times cash on hand than the GOP’s candidate, Troy Nehls.
The most consequential down-ballot fight, however, is for the Texas House, where Democrats are nine seats away from the majority. Republicans are hoping to flip back some of the 12 seats they lost in 2018, but even then, Democrats are working with a wide offensive battlefield, targeting at least the 17 seats where Republicans won by single digits in 2018.
“We’ve been sounding the alarm for months all across the county about how competitive Texas is, from the top of the ballot all the way down,” Austin Chambers, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said in an interview. “For us, Texas is a top priority. We’re gonna spend several million dollars and spend whatever it takes” to defend the House majority.
Chambers said there is “absolutely a path” for Democrats to flip the House. As for Trump’s impact down-ballot, Chambers said he expects the president to carry Texas but that the RSLC is focused on holding the House majority “regardless of what his margin is.”
“We just can’t sit back and say Donald Trump’s success is going to determine our success and leave it to chance,” Chambers said, noting there are House districts that strong candidates could carry while Trump loses.
Throughout down-ballot contests, state and national Republicans believe they have nominated a more diverse and uniquely qualified crop of candidates than usual. They point to contenders like Will Douglas, a Black pharmacy owner in Dallas who is challenging freshman state Rep. Rhetta Andrews Bowers, D-Garland. The district is one of Republicans’ tougher targets to reclaim in November — Bowers won by 7 points in 2018 — but Douglas is waging a robust challenge, easily outraising Bowers over the past year.
In an interview, Douglas said he is running a campaign relentlessly focused on jobs and the economy, appealing to blue-collar workers in the district who are looking for a local advocate “regardless of what’s happening at the top of the ticket.” Douglas pointed out that Trump lost the district by 2 points in 2016 while its Republican state representative at the time, Cindy Burkett, won it by 10.
“So we know that we have voters who are engaged that do the research, do their homework,” said Douglas, who spoke last month at a police reform roundtable that Trump held in Dallas. “They’re not just going in and voting straight ticket. … We know that there’s gonna be people that don’t necessarily like President Trump’s demeanor but also understand the importance of having their local officials reflect their values.”
In addition to candidate strength, Texas Republicans were encouraged — at least earlier in the cycle — by a renewed focus on traditional party functions like voter registration. The state party launched a drive last year to register 100,000 new Republicans, and some of the state’s biggest Republican donors plowed millions into a super PAC also focused on registration.
The results have been mixed. While the state party hit its goal early last month, the political action committee shuttered this spring, citing obstacles created by the pandemic. And Democrats are also prioritizing registration, both through their state party and third-party groups like Beto O’Rourke’s Powered by People, which started its efforts much more recently and claims to have registered “nearly 50,000 likely Democrats so far.”
In any case, at least in down-ballot races, Republicans believe their Democratic counterparts have tacked too far to the left and been too willing to nationalize contests. That latter factor was especially relevant, Chambers said, when state Rep. Gary Gates, R-Richmond, won overwhelmingly in a special election earlier this year that drew massive amounts of out-of-state attention.
Beyond politics, the next few months are filled with uncertainty for Texas Republicans. There is no end in sight to the pandemic, and Abbott, the face of the state’s response, has seen his approval ratings drop amid harsh criticism from ascendant Democrats and growing discontent from a still small — but vocal — segment in his own party.
Still, Republicans largely trust him, according to polls, and no Republicans in battleground races have split with him on the coronavirus response. His handling of the pandemic registered 72% approval among Republicans in the Quinnipiac University survey, even as voters overall delivered a split verdict.
On top of everything else, Texas Republicans are having to adjust to a sudden change in leadership at their state party. Allen West, the firebrand former Florida congressman, unseated Dickey on Monday in a resounding defeat that undoubtedly has implications for the final few months of the general election.
While Dickey had been hobbled by the botched convention, he had otherwise run on strongly positioning the party for November through fundraising, candidate recruitment and voter registration. West, meanwhile, ran on a broader platform of confronting Democrats more aggressively and attracted support from those who believed more needed to be done to hold fellow Republicans accountable.
In an illustration of the intraparty tensions still persisting as Texas Republicans barrel toward November, West used his final pitch to delegates to rail against the “tyranny that we see in the great state of Texas, where we have executive orders and mandates, people telling us what we can and cannot do, who is essential, who is not essential.” As of Friday evening — more than four days after West took over as the state party leader — the governor still has not publicly acknowledged his victory.

0,2020-07-26T11:26:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/1151828/,Trump’s secret police in Portland — and GOP lawmakers’ complicity — could have 2020 consequences: polling,"President Donald Trump’s brutal ongoing crackdown on protests in Portland, Oregon and his threats to send federal agents into other major U.S. cities in the coming days could have electoral consequences for not only Trump but also vulnerable Republican senators in key battleground states who are up for re-election this November, according to polling released Friday by MoveOn Political Action.
Public Policy Polling (PPP) this week surveyed registered voters in Arizona, Maine, and North Carolina, and found that majorities in all three states oppose Trump’s deployment of federal agents in Portland. Some critics have charged the president’s tactics are part of a ploy to sow chaos across the country in an effort to “steal” the election in November, when he is expected to face off against former Vice President Joe Biden. Voters also want Congress to intervene.
Although many Democratic members of Congress this week have condemned Trump’s actions in Portland and his promises to deploy agents elsewhere in the country, congressional lawmakers have so far failed to take any meaningful action and few Republicans have voiced any opposition.
PPP’s polling also showed that three GOP senators facing re-election—Martha McSally of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina—are all trailing their Democratic challengers.
“These results show that Trump’s plan to use unidentified federal agents to suppress local protests is backfiring with the public. Voters oppose it, and they want their senators to act,” Rahna Epting, MoveOn Political Action’s executive director, said in a statement Friday. “Continued enabling of Trump by Senators McSally, Collins, and Tillis is likely to hurt them at the ballot box.”
Epting added that “in this case, their political interests are aligned with the public interest, and they should do the right thing and join efforts in Congress to limit these abuses. When are they going to stand up to Trump’s continued abuses of power? Voters have had enough.”
That might be why our polls show all 3 of them trailing their Dem opponents among registered voters.
ME: 47-42, @SaraGideon over @SenSusanCollins (1st public poll since Gideon won her primary)
NC: 48-40, @CalforNC over @ThomTillis
AZ: 51-42, @CaptMarkKelly over @MarthaMcSally
— MoveOn (@MoveOn) July 24, 2020
Democrat Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut and co-founder of a nonprofit that advocates for stricter gun laws, now leads McSally by nine points, according to PPP. The pollsters also found that Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Sara Gideon leads Collins by five points and former North Carolina state Sen. Cal Cunningham leads Tillis by eight points.
In Arizona, nearly two-thirds of voters say they are following the situation in Portland closely; 52% of all respondents in the state oppose the use of unidentified federal agents to suppress local protests and 51% support Congress acting to stop it. Additionally, 55% back specific actions in a bill (S. 4220) introduced this week by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) that would restrict the use of federal officers to respond to protests.
Nearly two-thirds of Mainers are also paying close attention to Portland, and 56% of voters in the state both oppose Trump’s use of federal agents in the Oregon city and want lawmakers to stop it. Even more Maine voters (58%) support elements of Merkley’s legislation.
More than two-thirds of North Carolina voters are monitoring the federal crackdown in the Pacific Northwest. A majority of respondents (54%) say they oppose the agents suppressing protests there and 52% want Congress to end it. Even more (61%) say they support key parts of S. 4220.
MoveOn pointed out on Twitter Friday that of the 42 current co-sponsors of Merkley’s bill, Collins, McSally, and Tillis are all missing. In fact, none of the Republican lawmakers in the GOP-controlled upper chamber—which adjourned for the weekend—have signed on to the legislation.
The advocacy group called the bill “a start” and urged Congress to go even further, investigating “this abuse of Trump’s power.”
They should continue to reject Trump’s agents (as @RashidaTlaib, @ORDOJ and many others have), and vow to prosecute those who break the law (as @DA_LarryKrasner has). And we all need to do our part, including by voting out Trump and his enablers.

“And we all need to do our part,” the group added, “including by voting out Trump and his enablers.”

A survey released Friday by AP-NORC found that while 78% of workers who were furloughed or laid off in the early days of the pandemic believed in April that they’d be able to return to work eventually, just 34% are optimistic about their prospects now. Just 18% have already returned to their jobs, and 47% say they no longer believe their old jobs will be available ever again.
The same poll found that 72% of Americans would still rather see the federal, state, and local governments impose restrictions aimed at preserving public health rather than prioritizing reopening economies while the coronavirus continues to spread across the country.
Though many Americans were hopeful in March and April that the closings of schools and businesses were temporary interruptions of daily life, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis released earlier this month found that the number of people who have permanently lost their jobs has steadily been on the rise since March.
Research released separately Thursday by Yelp, the online business review website, showed that among establishments that are currently shut down, permanent closures now make up a larger share than temporary ones.
“Even as total closures fall, permanent closures increase with 72,842 businesses permanently closed, out of the 132,580 total closed businesses, an increase of 15,742 permanent closures since June 15,” reported Yelp. “This also means that the percentage of permanent to temporary business closures is rising, with permanent closures now accounting for 55% of all closed businesses since March 1.”
Jamaal Bowman, a progressive who won the Democratic primary in New York’s 16th district last month, called for “historic levels of economic investments to lift up our communities” after seeing the report.
“As of mid-July, 55% of the 132,500 pandemic-era closures on Yelp are now permanent.”

Harvard researcher Michael Stepner, who has tracked businesses since the pandemic began, told the Washington Post that many owners are having to make hard decisions about whether to renew their leases, knowing the economic effects of the crisis could stretch on for many months.
“It is really hard to make a one-year commitment to paying rent when businesses are closing down for the second time and there’s no end in sight to this virus,” Stepner told the Post.
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), devised in March ostensibly to help small businesses, ended up sending much of its funding to private equity firms, large law firms, and businesses with ties to President Donald Trump, while hundreds of thousands of small companies have still not recieved aid following a second round of PPP funding.
A new round of funding will be reserved for businesses with fewer than 300 workers that can demonstrate they’ve lost 50% of their revenue, according to a proposal released by Republican leaders on Thursday.
Permanent business closures are highest in the restaurant industry, with more than 15,000 closures reported by Yelp. More than 12,000 retail stores’ closures are permanent, and nearly 5,000 beauty and personal care establishments have shuttered for good.
Las Vegas has so far experienced the highest number of permanent closings as the city faces a sharp, months-long decline in tourism.
Hawaii, whose economy also relies heavily on tourism, has also been hit by closing businesses, and states that have suffered major outbreaks of Covid-19 have seen large numbers of businesses shut down.
While Republican leaders have been reticent to offer robust aid to working families and have allowed large corporations to take much of the aid meant for struggling small companies, powerful Democrats in Congress have also stood in the way of some of the most ambitious aid proposals, such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal’s (D-Wash.) Paycheck Guarantee Act. 
Similar to a program introduced early in the pandemic in Denmark, Jayapal’s proposal would have directed the federal government to help any company struggling to stay afloat during the pandemic by covering 100% of employees’ paychecks up to $100,000.
House Minority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) acknowledged that Jayapal’s proposal was the “most efficient” way to help keep businesses open and people employed during the pandemic, but suggested it was too expensive.
According to Moody’s Analytics, the Paycheck Guarantee Act would have cost $654 billion over six months and would have directly benefited more than 36 million U.S. workers.
Clyburn was among 139 Democrats who joined Republicans this week in voting for the National Defense Authorization Act, which cost more than $740 billion.
Reacting to a report last week about dozens of independently-owned l businesses closing for good in Seattle, Jayapal repeated her call for her legislation to be passed.
We can’t continue to allow businesses to shutter. Congress must step in by passing my Paycheck Recovery Act—the quickest, most direct way to stop mass unemployment, cover paychecks, and get relief to businesses so they aren’t forced to close permanently. https://t.co/5sZPuOlKcr

“We can’t continue to allow businesses to shutter,” the Washington Democrat tweeted.

“On the second Friday in June, a group of political operatives, former government and military officials, and academics quietly convened online for what became a disturbing exercise in the fragility of American democracy,” the Boston Globe reported Saturday. “The group, which included Democrats and Republicans, gathered to game out possible results of the November election, grappling with questions that seem less far-fetched by the day: What if President Trump refuses to concede a loss, as he publicly hinted recently he might do? How far could he go to preserve his power? And what if Democrats refuse to give in?”
While former Vice President Joe Biden currently has large leads in public polling on the race, Trump has refused to say he will accept the results if he loses.
A Georgetown law professor and former Defense Department official who helped organize the Transition Integrity Project explained the situation to the newspaper.
“All of our scenarios ended in both street-level violence and political impasse,” Prof. Rosa Brooks explained. “The law is essentially … it’s almost helpless against a president who’s willing to ignore it.”
The scenarios are dark.
“Using a role-playing game that is a fixture of military and national security planning, the group envisioned a dark 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day, one in which Trump and his Republican allies used every apparatus of government — the Postal Service, state lawmakers, the Justice Department, federal agents, and the military — to hold onto power, and Democrats took to the courts and the streets to try to stop it,” the Globe explained.
“If it sounds paranoid or outlandish — a war room of seasoned politicos and constitutional experts playing a Washington version of Dungeons and Dragons in which the future of the republic hangs in the balance — they get it,” the newspaper reported. “But, as they finalize a report on what they learned and begin briefing elected officials and others, they insist their warning is serious: A close election this fall is likely to be contested, and there are few guardrails to stop a constitutional crisis, particularly if Trump flexes the considerable tools at his disposal to give himself an advantage.”
Historian Nils Gilman explained the leverage Trump has in a contested election.
“He doesn’t have to win the election,” said Gilman. “He just has to create a plausible narrative that he didn’t lose.”

0,2020-07-26T11:02:58+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/senate-gop-slammed-for-allowing-eviction-moratorium-to-expire-putting-millions-of-us-families-at-risk-during-covid-19-crisis/,Senate GOP slammed for allowing eviction moratorium to expire — putting millions of US families at risk during COVID-19 crisis,"Housing and human rights advocates on Saturday slammed the Republican-controlled Senate for skipping town and allowing a federal moratorium on evictions to expire, putting millions of households across the country at risk for losing their homes in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Despite objections from Democrats, the upper chamber adjourned Thursday evening without lawmakers taking action to extend the eviction moratorium—which expired Friday—or the $600-per-week addition to unemployment benefits that Congress enacted earlier this year in response to the current public health and economic crises.
The eviction moratorium put in place by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March protected more than 12 million people who live in homes with federally backed mortgages from being forced onto the streets. Other local and state moratoria have also recently expired.
“With eviction bans expiring across the country, courts reopening and many people facing continued unemployment, our nation faces a crisis of enormous scale and dimension that we could easily avoid,” Kristen Clarke of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement Saturday. “As a result of the Senate’s failure to act, then leaving town, millions of vulnerable renters now stand on the brink of homelessness.”
A study released in mid-July by the Colorado-based Covid Eviction Defense Project found that as many as 23 million U.S. families could be evicted by October without assistance from the federal government.
“We can’t stand by idly and watch the public health emergency drive our nation’s most vulnerable families out of their apartments and homes into the streets,” said Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee. “Relief is needed now to ensure that the public health emergency does not result in further devastation for our nation’s poorest and most vulnerable families.”
Mass evictions are here and they are proving crushing to Black mothers and Black families.https://t.co/f6TlL8Xgwd
— Kristen Clarke (@KristenClarkeJD) July 24, 2020
Stanford Law School professor Michelle Wilde Anderson and Shamus Roller, executive director at the National Housing Law Project, issued a similar warning in an op-ed published Saturday by The Hill, writing that “the current public health and unemployment emergency is about to become a housing crisis.”
“Evictions have huge societal consequences even in normal times, leading to school turnover for children, absence from work, and additional family debt,” the pair explained. “They propel a deterioration in living conditions that, in turn, increases ER admissions for chronic and stress-related illnesses. In the middle of a pandemic, evictions are more dangerous still, disrupting a family’s ability to shelter-in-place and practice social distancing. Evictions force families to seek new housing and crowd into relatives’ homes.”
Anderson and Roller continued:
Some will become homeless, piling onto the humanitarian emergency of shelters and encampments that cannot meet quarantine and social distancing requirements.
Just as people of color are facing the worst impacts of Covid-19 and the economic downturn, so too, they are facing the most significant risks of eviction. Systemic inequities in the housing market, both historical and current, mean that Black and Latino’s households are much less likely to own their own homes.
  When they rent, they pay a higher average share of their income for housing. The current moment has us trapped in a vicious cycle: Higher death rates fuel lockdowns and job losses, job losses mean missed rent, missed rent risks evictions that prevent families from staying home to flatten the curve. Even without a public health crisis, housing displacement of the magnitude expected in the coming weeks would risk a devastating collapse of the real estate market.
Anderson and Roller called on President Donald Trump and the Senate to enact the rental assistance and nationwide eviction moratorium included in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act that the Democrat-controlled House passed in May. Senate Majority Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has so far declined to put the measure to a vote.
When asked on Tuesday whether Covid-19 relief legislation would pass before the end of next week, McConnell laughed. Ashley Schapitl, a spokesperson for Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), put the GOP leader’s response into context, tweeting that “thirty million workers won’t be able to pay rent on August 1st and McConnell is laughing.”
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on July 16 introduced the Rent Emergencies Leave Impacts on Evicted Families (RELIEF) Act, which she highlighted in a Saturday tweet about the expired eviction moratorium while calling on Congress to protect renters:
The federal eviction moratorium has expired. Millions of Americans are now at risk of losing the roof over their head. My heart aches for all those facing uncertainty right now. Congress must move immediately to protect renters. Let’s start with my RELIEF Act to stop evictions.
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) July 25, 2020
Harris’ proposal, as Forbes contributor Dima Williams detailed Saturday, “is a rather comprehensive bill that stops evictions for a year; prohibits the shutoff of utilities such as water, electricity, and gas; prevents landlords from raising rent; and provides an 18-month grace period for tenants to make up any missed rent payments.”
The legislation would also “stop landlords from reporting any unpaid rent to credit agencies, while holding exploitative or delinquent property owners accountable,” and direct the Congressional Oversight Commission “to scrutinize landlords’ conduct and provides subpoena and prosecution authority to state Attorneys General so that they can investigate violations of renter protections,” Williams noted.
Harris isn’t the only congressional Democrat with a plan to protect renters during the pandemic; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), along with Reps. Jesús G. “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) and Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), introduced the Protecting Renters from Evictions and Fees Act in late June. Their bill would extend and expand the federal eviction moratorium that expired Friday until March 2021.
“Unemployment benefits are set to expire next week,” Warren tweeted Friday afternoon. “The eviction moratorium is up. Congress can prevent this catastrophe—but we must act now.”

Ron DeSantis was the focus of an in-depth Washington Post exposé examining why Florida is failing at coronavirus.
“As Florida became a global epicenter of the coronavirus, Gov. Ron DeSantis held one meeting this month with his top public health official, Scott Rivkees, according to the governor’s schedule. His health department has sidelined scientists, halting briefings last month with disease specialists and telling the experts there was not sufficient personnel from the state to continue participating,” the newspaper reported.
The newspaper interviewed scores of sources for the story.
“As the virus spread out of control in Florida, decision-making became increasingly shaped by politics and divorced from scientific evidence according to interviews with 64 current and former state and administration officials, health administrators, epidemiologists, political operatives and hospital executives. The crisis in Florida, these observers say, has revealed the shortcomings of a response built on shifting metrics, influenced by a small group of advisers and tethered at every stage to the Trump administration, which has no unified plan for addressing the national health emergency but has pushed for states to reopen,” The Post explained.
DeSantis has largely ignored experts.
“DeSantis relies primarily on the advice of his wife, Casey, a former television reporter and host, and his chief of staff, Shane Strum, a former hospital executive, according to Republican political operatives, including a former member of his administration,” the newspaper noted.
The approach has resulted in widespread destruction.
“The response — which DeSantis boasted weeks ago was among the best in the nation — has quickly sunk Florida into a deadly morass. Nearly 5,800 Floridians have now died of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus — more deaths than were suffered in combat by Americans in Afghanistan or Iraq after 2001. One out of every 52 Floridians has been infected with the virus. The state’s intensive care units are being pushed to the brink, with some over capacity. Florida’s unemployment system is overwhelmed, and its tourism industry is a shambles,” the newspaper reported.
Trump, however, praised DeSantis in a statement.
“Ron DeSantis is doing a great job and will go down in history as a great governor of Florida,” Trump claimed.

0,2020-07-26T10:41:26+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/reagan-foundation-demands-trump-and-rnc-stop-raising-money-off-his-image-report/,Reagan Foundation demands Trump and RNC stop raising money off his image: report,"The legacy nonprofit of the 40th U.S. President, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, responded this week to a joint fundraising stunt from the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Donald Trump’s re-election campaign by squashing it, the Washington Post reported Saturday. The Foundation’s concern? The Trump campaign’s trading of trashy coin and photo sets featuring the Gipper and the Orange Menace for a little less than 50 bucks.
“It was simply handled with a phone call mid-last week to the RNC, and they agreed to stop,” Reagan Foundation chief marketing officer Melissa Giller told the Post of the latest cease-and-desist demand faced by the campaign to keep the country in the hands of a Velveeeta-hued despot and his wholly-unqualified children.
The latest, but not the first.
It’s no secret that Trump and his team have a history of using songs at rallies and events without permission, and then facing the wrath of musicians and their attorneys, who use colorful and big words, respectively, to insist that Trump never, ever do that again. Additionally, the call to stop using Reagan’s name and likeness on the gold “colored” coins and in fundraising emails comes nearly three months after Reagan’s daughter, Patti Davis, chastised the Republican Party—the entire party!—for invoking her daddy’s name when attempting to “justify” continued support of Trump.
This latest episode started with an email on July 19, according to the Post. The ridiculous fundraising email was crafted to seem like it came from DJT himself, but actually came from the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a “joint venture” between the campaign to keep Trump in office and the RNC.
The solicitation offered, for a donation of $45 or more, a “limited edition” commemorative set featuring two gold-colored coins, one each with an image of Reagan and Trump. The coins were mounted with a 1987 photograph of Reagan and Trump shaking hands in a White House receiving line — the type of fleeting contact that presidents have with thousands of people a year.
It’s worth noting here that Trump himself uses the “fleeting contact” excuse to dodge any unsavory associations for which photographic evidence exists, most notoriously with Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas.
But back to the email.
“Friend,” the fundraising email purportedly from Trump said, “I just saw our new Trump-Reagan Commemorative Coin Sets and WOW, these coins are beautiful – I took one look and immediately knew that I wanted YOU to have a set. These aren’t any ordinary coins. They symbolize an important time in our Nation. This year, in addition to being re-elected as YOUR President, it also marks the 40th anniversary of our Nation’s 40th President, Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, we already sold out of the first batch we had in stock. But I liked these coins so much that I asked my team to rush order another batch for my TOP SUPPORTERS ONLY.”
It cautioned: “I’ve authorized a very limited production of these iconic coins, which is why I’m ONLY offering them to our top supporters, like YOU. This offer is NOT available to the general public, so please, do NOT share this email with anyone.”
Unfortunately for the campaign to keep the coronavirus great, someone on the mailing list DID share that email with someone, and the Reagan Foundation found out. “Within seconds,” as Giller described it, the leadership decided to shut it down. Though the RNC did agree to the Foundation’s demand, Giller notes that they’re still tracking down how many people saw the email and how many “top supporters” bought the non-legal tender and photo of Donnie’s Big Day with Ronnie. In fact, Giller adds, the Foundation is still deciding whether or not to involve attorneys.
This response was not expected by the campaign, and certainly not the RNC, whose comms director, Michael Ahrens, dashed off a pouty email to the Post. “Given that the Reagan Foundation just recently hosted the Trump family to raise money for its organization and has not objected to us using President Reagan’s likeness before, their objection came as a surprise. Even though we believe our use of the image was appropriate, we will stop emailing this fundraising solicitation as a courtesy,” he wrote in anything but a courteous manner.
As of this writing, though, the commemorative set, as gaudy and gold-plated as Trump himself, is still available through the campaign. Here’s a screenshot I took at 4:20pm PDT, which hasn’t changed at all from the Web Archive capture on July 18.
Trump, of course, loves to invoke Reagan, though he had no idea that the Gipper’s own 1980 racist campaign slogan, “Let’s Make America Great Again,” preceded Trump’s MAGA-fication of the red-hatted GOP. When he was made aware that he didn’t originate the dogwhistle, Trump triumphantly sneered that Reagan hadn’t trademarked the phrase, while he had, even touting his knowledge of marketing.
Consistent with most of the one-term failure’s understanding of things, that “knowledge” only goes so far. The rights to all things Reagan—Ronald and Nancy—have belonged to the Reagan Foundation since the 1990s.

0,2020-07-25T13:35:13+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/four-supreme-court-justices-are-fine-with-transmitting-coronavirius-in-the-name-of-jesus/,Four Supreme Court justices are fine with transmitting coronavirius in the name of Jesus,"Late on Friday the Supreme Court again issued a fast-tracked ruling which decided that a Nevada church isn’t being discriminated against when it’s not treated equally to a Las Vegas casino.
This story first appeared at The Signorile Report.
The decision was 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts, once again, joining the court’s liberals. This was the second time the court ruled on this issue; previously a California Pentecostal church had claimed its rights were violated by coronavirus restrictions, and Justice Roberts joined the four liberals. He wrote a concurring opinion with the majority in May stating that the church was being treated no differently than any other public establishment that was shut down due to Governor Gavin Newsom’s orders.
This time the Nevada church argued it was being treated differently because churches are kept to a 50-person limit while casinos are being kept to a 50 percent capacity. The church wanted to seat 90 people. This time the majority issued no opinion, but the minority went bonkers, raising holy hell, and issued no less than three dissents — one from Samuel Alito, one from Neal Gorsuch and one from Brett Kavanaugh.
“A public health emergency does not give governors and other public officials carte blanche to disregard the Constitution for as long as the medical problem persists,” Alito thundered. Gorsuch went with: “[T]here is no world in which the Constitution permits Nevada to favor Caesars Palace over Calvary Chapel.”
Share The Signorile Report
But in fact, Nevada treated churches just as it treated other venues in which larger numbers of people congregate and where social distancing is impractical: Movie theaters, concert halls, sporting arenas, live entertainment halls and other venues. The casinos were treated as other businesses in which strict adherence — in-use slot machines separated far apart, for example — are easily enforceable.
Frankly, I don’t think the casinos or any businesses should be open in a state that is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases and which opened too early.
But as the federal district judge declared when he ruled against the church, the discretion should be given to state health officials. He quoted Roberts’ opinion from the earlier California case: “Whether a church is more like a casino or more like a concert or lecture hall for purposes of assessing risk of Covid-19 transmission is precisely the sort of ‘dynamic and fact-intensive’ decision-making ‘subject to reasonable disagreement’ that the court should refrain from engaging in.”
This is one of those cases that, while a minor blip in all the news happening right now, underscores just how forceful the religious liberty adherents on the Supreme Court are. It’s a reminder about cases like several recent ones — allowing employers wide latitude to discriminate on the basis of religious beliefs, which ultimately includes against LGBTQ people and women — and many cases coming up to the court.
Justice Roberts is clearly the swing vote in these religious liberty cases but, the churches and coronavirus aside, he’s with the conservatives on this issue more than he’s with the liberals, especially when it has long-lasting effects.

0,2020-07-25T13:11:14+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/historian-outlines-a-terrifying-scenario-that-could-happen-if-trump-loses/,Historian outlines a terrifying scenario that could happen if Trump loses,"It looks like Biden will beat Trump badly and the Republicans will suffer disastrous losses across the country in November. Although the polls have just been inching toward the Democrats, suddenly articles about what Trump might do if he loses are multiplying, here, here, and here.
Trump might declare the elections fake, go on FOX News to say he had really won, call out the National Guard, barricade himself in the Oval Office, order the Secret Service to shoot Biden on sight.
But what he will do is the wrong question. What matters is what his supporters will do when they lose.
Three groups of supporters are crucial to observe. The media will focus at first on Republican politicians. Will Senate losers in Montana, Arizona, Colorado, and other states jump on the fake news bandwagon? Would Mitch McConnell go quietly if Amy McGrath beats him in a very close race? Maybe Susan Collins will accept defeat in Maine, but what about QAnon promoter Jo Rae Perkins in Oregon? How about Lauren Boebert, QAnon enthusiast and House candidate in Colorado, and the other 7 Republican congressional candidates on the ballot who have expressed support for QAnon?
The whole Republican Senate delegation has already cast doubt on the results by allowing their leader to proclaim unchallenged that the election will be fraudulent. On June 22, Trump said the 2020 election “will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history”. In 2018, the National Republican Senatorial Committee followed up a Trump tweet about “electoral corruption” in the Arizona Senate race by charging that the election they lost there was rigged. Stripped of power, perhaps for years, it’s not hard to imagine Senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, among others, casting doubt on the results.
Thus far the bravest Republicans in Washington, aside from Mitt Romney, are Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who called Trump’s pardon of Roger Stone a “mistake”, and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who said she won’t campaign against Joe Biden. The majority of Senate Republicans cowers in silence.
Will Trump’s toadies now running our intelligence services and justice system speak up and what will they say? Across the country, Republican state legislators who lose their gerrymandered majorities could join the chorus.
A second set of Trump supporters use their control of media to send waves of influence into every corner of America. Will FOX News report the official results or attack them? How about the other people to whom Republicans listen, even more partisan and less connected to reality, like Limbaugh, Breitbart, InfoWars, Drudge? Will powerful evangelical pastors Franklin Graham and Robert Jeffress proclaim that their God-given leader was cheated?
The third group is the most important and hardest to gauge – the MAGA-hat-wearing, Confederate-flag-waving white supremacists and conspiracy partisans who make up his legendary “base”. Will they see the end times coming as their messiah is defeated? Will the dozens of armed militia groups adopt 2nd Amendment remedies to the impending takeover of America by radical socialist pedophiles? What will Ammon Bundy, the boogaloo boys, the Oath Keepers, and the more than 500 other anti-government groups loosely allied in the so-called “patriot movement” identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center do? Will the NRA call out its members to fight the commies?
Trump could scream himself hoarse with no effect unless his supporters sing along. As full election results trickle in the days after November 3 and as the implications sink in with the approach of Inauguration Day on January 20, 2021, a coalition of supporters in Washington, state governments, media, and on the ground might throw our country into an existential, not merely Constitutional crisis.
It’s certain that Trump will do nothing brave himself, will commit himself to no action that he can’t back out of. But the radicals who drive their cars into Black Lives Matter protesters, who bring their assault rifles to the pizza palace, and who believe anything “Q” says are much more volatile, unhinged, and violent.
Whatever answers such questions might elicit now will change over the next few months, as Trump stokes more fear among his supporters, pushes them further away from the American center, and forces his Republican allies to come along.
Watch Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Matt Gaetz (Florida) and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (California), Gov. Ron DeSantis (Florida), and Mark Meadows, White House Chief of Staff. Watch wily Mitch McConnell, who shares with Trump a powerful belief in the importance of his own survival.
And watch out for America.

0,2020-07-25T13:04:18+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/a-realistic-strategy-for-overturning-citizens-united-within-10-years/,A realistic strategy for overturning Citizens United within 10 years,"Most Americans share similar views about how to get big money of politics. Polling released in 2018 showed that 66 percent of Republicans, 70 percent of independents, and 85 percent of Democrats support a constitutional amendment. But since we haven’t amended the Constitution since 1992, the idea sounds like an impossibility to many. Of course, passing an amendment is inherently difficult—requiring support from two thirds of Congress and three quarters of states. Yet we are already closer to the goal than most people know.
In fact, an amendment has more momentum in Congress than many other widely discussed policy proposals. With a focused bipartisan campaign, activists could push one across the finish line in less than a decade.
Consider where things stand today. 47 sitting Senators have already expressed support for an amendment, compared to just 15 who have signed on to Medicare For All. More than 200 House members back it too, compared to only 21 who have signed on to the Free College For All Act. Additionally, 20 states have already expressed their support for an amendment through legislation or a ballot initiative, including “red states” like Montana and West Virginia. All told, that’s more than half that is needed. Plus, when those two states agree with California and Oregon, you know this is an issue than can transcend partisanship.
But ten years after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. FEC decision, which allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, we are still waiting. That’s primarily because the idea does not yet have the bipartisan support in Congress that it does among voters. And that’s due to the specific Republicans that have been in power since 2010. Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy are huge beneficiaries of big money and, not coincidentally, staunch opponents of campaign finance reform. Another reason is that some amendment proposals to overturn Citizens United have been divisive and partisan.
Many politicians and activists have conflated campaign finance reform with abolishing all corporate constitutional rights, which misunderstands the problem and draws valuable energy away from the real battle. Stripping Fifth Amendment protections away from corporations would allow the government to seize property without just compensation, but would not bring us closer to campaign finance reform.
Similarly, by framing the fight to get big money out of politics as a battle between Democrats and Republicans, instead of one between the people and the powerful, some organizations have made the issue unduly polarizing.
Fortunately, there are ways to improve our chances of making history. By focusing on the core issue of campaign finance reform rather than the red herring of corporate constitutional rights, there’s a path toward ensuring that Citizens United does not survive another ten years.
Though passing a constitutional amendment may sound like a drastic step, it is the most logical way to fix our broken campaign finance system. Big money got into politics because of Supreme Court decisions like Buckley v. Valeo and Citizens United, which struck down federally enacted campaign spending limits designed to reduce political corruption and ensure that ultra-wealthy individuals and artificial entities did not gain undue influence over elections. In both cases, a slim majority of justices failed to acknowledge that independent expenditures—outside spending from individuals and groups—jeopardize the integrity of our elections and government.
Now, the only way to overturn those grievous decisions is through a constitutional amendment. It would be folly to expect subsequent decisions to reverse course. At the same time, the problems caused by big money in politics are important enough that we cannot afford to wait for the court to change its mind. And the reforms we can use within the current system are simply not enough. Neither more disclosure requirements nor publicly financed elections can stop billionaires from spending unlimited amounts of money.
Plus, there is always the risk that without an amendment, the Supreme Court could strike down some public financing systems as unconstitutional. An amendment that gives Congress, state legislatures, and voters the power to enact limits on campaign spending is the best response to the Court’s dangerous precedents.
The good news: This is achievable. Campaign finance reform has widespread bipartisan support among voters—74 percent of voters in “very red” districts are in favor of an amendment, along with 76 percent in “very blue” districts.
Campaign finance reform has historically been a bipartisan issue. In 1990, William Rehnquist and Thurgood Marshall agreed that restrictions on political expenditures by corporations were both constitutional and desirable in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce. As recently as 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act (also known as McCain-Feingold) passed with support from 51 congressional Republicans. Today’s GOP may have even more reason to support reform than their predecessors because many have been targeted by outside spending. In the 2018 election cycle for instance, liberal undisclosed “dark money” groups outspent conservative ones $81 million to $43 million.
But that reality is lost on many voters. Citizens United has become too polarized. John Katko of New York is the only Republican member of Congress signed onto any campaign finance reform amendment proposal. Much of that is due to Mitch McConnell’s leadership within his party. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t also look at holes in the advocacy for an amendment.
Some groups and politicians, such as Representative Pramila Jayapal, have combined the effort for a campaign finance reform amendment with a separate goal of abolishing all corporate constitutional rights. But it is a mistake to conclude that corporate constitutional rights—or the concept of corporate personhood—were the basis for Citizens United, or that abolishing such rights would solve the problem. The problem is that the Court has given both corporations and individuals a right neither should have—the right to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections. The sensible solution, which dissenting justices have expressed, is to allow legislatures to enact limits on outside spending by individuals or artificial entities, because such spending poses a “mortal danger” to the political process.
Furthermore, as law professor Garrett Epps has written, “[T]he Court in Citizens United expressly said that it was not relying on the idea of personhood as the basis for its decision striking down the McCain–Feingold Act’s limits on money in electioneering. The Court relied on the nature of the speech itself, not the identity of the speaker…Thus if by a heroic effort we enacted a constitutional amendment stating that corporations are not people, a future conservative Court would have no trouble striking down limits on corporate political expenditures anyway.”
Nonetheless, Representative Pramila Jayapal has introduced an amendment proposal aimed at overturning Citizens United that would also abolish all the constitutional rights of corporations and unions.
That comes with two flaws.
First, such a provision could lead to unintended consequences, such as preventing nonprofits like Planned Parenthood from filing lawsuits, or allowing the government to conduct searches and seizures of businesses without a warrant. Even many liberal law professors like Epps and Kent Greenfield oppose the abolition of all corporate constitutional rights. Second, by pairing the far less popular idea of abolishing the rights of unions and corporations with the goal of campaign finance reform, Jayapal’s proposal deters potential allies who share the second goal, but not the first. Other proposals that are focused exclusively on campaign finance reform, like H.J. Res 2 or the Restore Democracy Amendment (which I wrote), offer a better chance of success.
Of course, passing a constitutional amendment is going to require bipartisan support. That means progressives need to adjust their approach accordingly. Too many organizations have pursued an incomplete strategy of trying to pass an amendment solely by electing Democrats. For example, one PAC founded by former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee fundraisers called End Citizens United has raised more than $50 million by targeting left-leaning donors. But rather than attempting to build bipartisan support for an amendment, End Citizens United’s primary focus is on unseating Republicans. Similarly, groups like Public Citizen have done stellar work getting more than 200 Democrats to cosponsor H.J.Res 2, but that ratio has to change dramatically for an amendment to succeed. Simply put, we must make the same effort to work with Republicans who may support campaign finance reform that we do to unseat those who don’t.
That doesn’t mean we should expect an amendment to pass through this House or Senate. It won’t. We need to understand that this is a long-term project. But no matter how long it takes, bipartisan support is essential. The push for a campaign finance reform amendment among Congressional Republicans can follow a similar trajectory to the fight for same-sex marriage, by steadily gaining support over time. In 2009, only 21 percent of Republicans supported same-sex marriage, but in less than a decade, that more than doubled to 47 percent.
Passing an amendment to undo the damage caused by 40 years of bad Supreme Court decisions is one of the most important things we can do to improve government. If we can’t solve our underlying problems like big money in politics, we will never be able to tackle income inequality, prescription drug prices, or any other major problem that is exacerbated by our campaign finance system. In short, solving this problem is a prerequisite to solving our other problems.
Fortunately, we are closer to achieving the historic goal of passing a constitutional amendment to get big money out of politics than most people know. It can be done in ten or maybe even five years. But to cross the finish line, the focus should be on campaign finance reform rather than corporate personhood. We must work with Republicans and Democrats, and make the issue one of our top priorities. If we can do that, we can put Citizens United where it belongs—in the dustbin of history alongside Dred Scott v. Sanford and Bowers v. Hardwick.

TV’: Noam Chomsky responds to Trump bragging he aced a dementia test,"Is the United States being run by a madman? “What can you say about a person who, before speaking before an adoring crowd, raises his eyes to heaven and calls himself the chosen one?” says Noam Chomsky, responding to President Trump’s boast that he aced a mental acuity test.
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, The Quarantine Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. We are spending the hour with Noam Chomsky, world-renowned political dissident, linguist, and author, laureate professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Arizona, Tucson, and Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught for more than 50 years. Democracy Now!’s Nermeen Shaikh and I spoke to him Thursday.
AMY GOODMAN: Noam Chomsky, I wanted to play for you what President Trump said on Fox News about the cognitive test he recently took, saying it was difficult.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I took a test. I said to the doctor, it was Dr. Ronny Jackson, I said “is there some kind of a test, an acuity test?” And he said, “There actually is,” and he named it, whatever it might be. And it was 30 or 35 questions. The first questions are very easy. The last questions are much more difficult, like a memory question. It’s like you’ll go “person, woman, man, camera, TV.” So they would say, “Could you repeat that?” So I said, “Yeah. So it’s person, woman, man, camera, TV.” “OK, that’s very good.” If you get it in order, you get extra points.
AMY GOODMAN: President Trump saying he aced this test for dementia. He keeps talking about acing this cognitive test, a test that is given to see if someone is suffering from dementia, some kind of cognitive difficulties. This isn’t an IQ test. He continually goes back to it, even when told, “You’re asking to identify an elephant. You are being asked to draw a clock, to count back from 100 by sevens.” This is a test to see if a person is becoming senile. Is the United States being run by a madman, Noam Chomsky?
NOAM CHOMSKY: As you say, the test is given for dementia, incipient dementia, a serious mental illness. But what can you say about a person who, before speaking before an adoring crowd, raises his eyes to heaven and calls himself the chosen one? What can you say about an administration where the secretary of state says, “Perhaps Trump has been sent by the good lord to save Israel from Iran”? The country is being run by madmen.
There is no parallels to this. In fact, you can see it in everything that is happening. You go back to late March or so, the United States was about the same as Europe in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. It was roughly the same. Take a look at the chart since. Europe has sharply declined. It is not over the problems, not doing as well as Asia or Oceania, but way down. The United States remains stable. You look at the medical journals, they point out that Trump’s malfeasance and incompetence, whatever, just lack of concern for the welfare of the population, has killed maybe 100,000 people. That’s a pretty significant slaughter.
And that is why he is flailing around wildly to find somebody to blame it on. That is why he is using the current opportunity to send quasi-military forces, more or less paramilitary, to set up violent confrontations with Democratic mayors and governors. And there’s no precedent for sending militarized forces to control a city in opposition—when there is total opposition on the part of the mayor, the governor, the senators, obviously the population. This is treating the country like occupied territory, with the totally clear purpose of trying to set up confrontations which will somehow save him from electoral defeat.
And if there is defeat, he may just refuse to leave the White House, as he intimated on Fox News the other day, in which case you really have to ask, what happens next? Does the military move in and remove him? Or what happens when—or militias start surrounding the White House? We don’t know. This is a situation which has never arisen in a functioning democracy apart from the fascist takeovers in Italy and Germany, some other countries, in the interwar period.
Trump is sometimes, even by experts in the topic, called moving toward fascism. I think, frankly, that gives him much too much credit. Fascism was a serious ideology. I think it’s well beyond his ken or concern. This is more like a minor dictator in a small country that is subjected to military coups over the years. There is no conception of introducing real fascist ideology. In fact, in some ways, we are almost the opposite of it. The fascist systems were based on the principle that the powerful state under the leadership of the ruling party and the maximal leader should basically control everything. They should run and control the society, including the business community. We are almost the opposite. It is the business community controlling the government. And any infringement on their power would lead to a kind of confrontation that is almost unimaginable.
So I don’t think it is fascism. It is essentially tin-pot dictatorship. And he is desperate, will do anything, almost anything imaginable to try to keep himself from being tossed out of the White House. How this will eventuate, we don’t know, but it is going to be a very difficult couple of months ahead.

“Trump’s political allies, alarmed by his sinking poll numbers, are warning that the president’s best chance to get reelected is to outline more detailed plans to conquer the coronavirus he keeps trying to wish away,” reported Anita Kumar. “They are advising him to offer people something concrete they can look to as the pandemic surges in dozens of states, eroding months of progress.”
“He needs to talk about the future,” said Mitch McConnell adviser Scott Jennings said. “He needs to give people the plan that will return us to normalcy.” He added that the message needs to be “Make America Normal Again,” and “We can debate about how to talk about it, but certainly he needs to talk about it. When you ignore it, people are like, ‘Why are you ignoring it?’” Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed, saying, “The message has to be about the path forward.”
However, while Trump promised at the first of his new series of coroanvirus press briefings that “We are in the process of developing a strategy that’s going to be very, very powerful,” he has shown no indication of staying on topic about the virus — something that his aides reportedly were afraid of.
“He demonized protesters. He crowed about mail-in voting fraud. He bragged — more than once — about the results of a cognitive test,” said the report. “Then this week, Trump made more public attempts to change his focus. He spoke of plans to protect nursing home residents. He discussed an agreement to purchase potential coronavirus vaccines. He backed away from strident demands for the next economic relief package being hashed out on Capitol Hill.”

“Playing host at a small dinner on Tuesday night in honor of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the American ambassador to Britain, Robert Wood Johnson IV, told his guests that the wine was from President Trump’s vineyard in Virginia. He was serving it, he joked, even though it might be ethically improper,” the newspaper reported. “The next day, Mr. Johnson was not making any more jokes about ethics. On Twitter, he insisted he had “followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times” after The New York Times reported that at the president’s request, he had raised with a British official the idea of steering the British Open golf tournament to Mr. Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland.”
Johnson’s actions have alarmed career staff.
“In the ranks of the American diplomatic corps, Mr. Johnson’s enthusiasm for pleasing Mr. Trump has raised questions about whether Mr. Johnson — a 73-year-old pharmaceutical heir, N.F.L. team owner and longtime friend of the president’s — has put promoting his boss over his diplomatic duties,” The Times reported. “It has also deepened the misgivings of the London embassy’s staff about his judgment, given his reputation for off-color jokes and remarks to subordinates that some said have crossed the line into sexism or racism. His behavior has eroded morale among career diplomats and has surfaced in a State Department inspector general’s look at the embassy, the results of which are in a report filed in February but not yet released.”
The newspaper interviewed Lewis A. Lukens, who had served as Johnson’s deputy.
“Instances like this reinforce the image of an ambassador out of touch with government ethics requirements and more interested in serving the president’s personal interests than representing the country overseas,” he explained.
The newspaper also detailed how “Johnson regularly made his female and Black staff members uncomfortable with comments about their appearances or race.”

Check.
Hostile civilians gathered together on the street in protest of the occupation army? Check.
Complete lack of knowledge about the civilian population on the part of the occupying army — whose members are not from the area and are there on temporary assignment? Check.
No lines of communication between the two sides? Check.
Random civilians grabbed off the street and hustled away to God-only-knows-where without probable cause or criminal charges? Check.
Stagnant situation on the ground that doesn’t get better no matter how many troops are moved in and how many civilians are grabbed off the street? Check.
Occupying army operating on orders from distant commanders far away from the action, who have limited information from the scene and no local authority? Check.
The whole thing deteriorating into a quagmire from which neither side will back down? Check.
It’s so eerily similar, the old quote from then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld comes to mind: “You go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time,” he told a group of soldiers who were complaining about the haphazard manner of their assignment to Iraq and their lack of proper equipment.
That’s precisely Trump’s problem, isn’t it? He hasn’t been able to “go to war” with the army he wants against Black Lives Matter protesters — because his real army has refused to take the battlefield. Remember? That happened after Trump used some National Guard troops under federal control to clear protesters out of the way near Lafayette Park for his disastrous photo-op with a borrowed Bible outside St. John’s Church on June 1. It turned out that Trump had somehow mouse-trapped the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, to accompany him.
But shortly after that, Milley and other military commanders reacted forcefully and negatively to Trump’s use of active-duty soldiers against peaceful protesters. By the end of the week, all regular Army soldiers had been sent home from their temporary assignments to Washington, and military leaders had drawn a line in the sand that they would not cross. Without threatening to disobey orders from the commander in chief, military leaders made it clear that they would not facilitate Trump’s militarization of his response to protesters around the country.
Trump wanted a show of force against protesters who had taken to the streets to show their support for Black Lives Matter. Protesters were in the streets by the thousands to protest the killing of George Floyd as well as other killings and use of force against Black Americans by police. Trump seized on the spreading unrest to launch a new push for “law and order” in an effort to boost his sagging campaign for re-election.
But where? And how? It looked at first like Trump would order the streets cleared in downtown Seattle, during the period when they were occupied by protesters, but Seattle took care of that with their own cops. So he focused his attention on the uprisings in Portland that had been going on nightly since the end of May against both the Floyd killing and the death of Jason Washington, a Portland resident killed by police in 2018.
Trump couldn’t order in the 82nd Airborne Division. He tried that in Washington and failed. So he ordered William Barr, his attorney general, and Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, to cobble together a homemade militia using officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection.  These are civilian enforcement agents trained to patrol the borders with Mexico and Canada, check travelers at airports for contraband in their carry-ons, and inspect shipments of imported goods coming across our borders from foreign countries.
How do you create an intimidating army out of a bunch of civil servants whose previous experience in law enforcement has been locking up little kids and their moms along the border and frisking traveling salespersons at airports for bottles containing more than three ounces of shampoo?
Drape them in plenty of camo, of course. Give them a budget and turn them loose on the internet to visit sites like TacticalGear.com, where you can buy everything from a Condor Three-Fold Mag Recovery Pouch to High Speed Gear Taco Kydex handcuff pouches to Blackhawk Highstorm Advanced Tactical Elbow Pads V2 to a Condor Open Top M4 Mag Pouch to a Safariland Quick Release Leg Strap SLS Tactical Thigh Holster to a Hazard 4 Small ID Window Patch.
No, on second thought, forget the Hazard 4 Small ID Window Patch. You won’t be needing that particular piece of camo tactical gear because you won’t be displaying any identification at all.
The unmarked, unnamed Trumpian shock troops look like they’ve been assembled from an off-the-shelf parts bin. It’s lame-o “law and order,” done on the cheap. And that’s the problem with insta-militias like the one deployed in Portland and those planned for deployment to Chicago, Albuquerque, and other metropolitan areas around the country with mayors who happen to be Democrats. How intimidating can a pretend army be if it’s wearing patches that say  “Transportation Security Administration”? What are protesters going to do? Throw up their arms and cry out, “I give up! I forgot and packed my nail clippers!”
The camo-goofs sent out by Barr and Wolf to terrorize protesters in Portland are using tear gas, “non-lethal” riot control weapons, and paintball guns firing pepper pellets. Some photographs from the scene in Portland clearly show these government militia armed with M4 rifles and carrying 9mm handguns in leg holsters, but there have been no reports of lethal ammunition being used against protesters. Yet.
Protesters have been wearing bicycle helmets, goggles, face shields and heavy clothing, including some tactical vests probably purchased from the same outfitters the militarized government thugs use.
Recently, the protesters in Portland have had some success against the government militias by arraying a “Wall of Moms” with interlocking arms against the armed government troops. When tear gas was used against the moms, dads began showing up armed with leaf blowers to dissipate tear gas away from protesters. They are the same tactics used by the Yippies in Chicago in 1968 when they showed up at the Democratic National Convention and announced they would run a 145-pound pig named Pigasus for president.
Sometimes confronting force with humor is the best tactic. Moms in yellow T-shirts and dads with leaf-blowers are the perfect way to show up Trump as a pitiful helpless giant. His moves to bring fascism to the streets of America are working about as well as his attempts to wish away the virus that is ravaging the country in a silent riot of disease and death.
Donald Trump is a toy fascist. This time we don’t need the Yippies to run a pig for president. The Republican Party is doing that for us.

“This whole house of cards is going to collapse,” Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) warned during a press conference Friday afternoon.
As Common Dreams reported, the departure of the GOP-controlled Senate for the weekend without a resolution to the benefits questions earned the upper chamber’s leadership a harsh rebuke in a speech from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who called the decision by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to recess until Monday unacceptable.
“The lapse that is being forced on this country right now is because Senate Republicans would not step up,” said Wyden. “The lapse is going to lead to evictions, it’s going to lead to hunger, it’s going to lead to desperation for millions of Americans.”
House Democrats took to Twitter to decry their Senate GOP colleagues for abdicating their responsibility to the American people, noting that Republicans found time to vote for a mammoth $740 billion Pentagon budget but failed to approve anything to meet the needs of struggling workers and families.
“Senate Republicans have left Washington without passing the HEROES Act, without proposing their own Covid relief package, and without extending enhanced unemployment benefits for millions,” tweeted Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “But they were able to pass a $740 billion defense budget with no trouble.”
Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) echoed those concerns and pointed out that the Senate’s departure ensures the benefit will run out after next week’s claims.
“The cliff is here and Americans are suffering,” said Chu.
Progressive groups like Indivisible are urging members to pressure senators to have a vote on the HEROES Act, which Democrats in the House passed in May, as soon as possible.
Filmmaker Michael Moore cautioned lawmakers not to let the unemployment benefits lapse lest the country tip into a total economic mess.
“The magnitude of suffering this is about to cause is so immense,” said Moore, “they have no idea of how much shit is gonna hit the fan.”

0,2020-07-25T00:16:48+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-die-has-been-cast-even-biden-cant-stop-americas-decline-as-a-preeminent-superpower/,The die has been cast: Even Biden can’t stop America’s decline as a preeminent superpower,"COVID-19 has not only presented the global economy with its greatest public health challenge in over a century, but also likely killed off the notion of America’s “unipolar moment” for good. That doesn’t mean full-on autarky or isolationism but, rather, enlightened selfishness, which allows for some limited cooperation. Donald Trump’s ongoing threats to impose additional tariffs on a range of EU exports are exacerbating this trend as the old post-World War II ties between the two regions continue to fray. Even the possibility of a Biden administration is unlikely to presage a reversion to the status quo ante. Regionalization and multipolarity will be the order of the day going forward.
Many will regard these developments as chiefly driven by geopolitical prerogatives. But over time, the driving engine of the process will be a combination of maturing technologies that are rewriting the laws of profitability in manufacturing and production for advanced economies. The various capacities that enabled a far-flung global supply chain and sent the economies of Asia into hyperdrive over the past 40 years have continued to mature. The rise of China, South Korea and Japan in this period is just a phase of a larger series of advances that are now likely to become more distributed and at the same time reshuffle the geopolitical trend lines we currently experience.
The reshuffling is coming in large part because America’s historic military dominance has less relevance in a world where the new forms of competition place greater weight on access to advanced research and technologies, rather than the projection of brute military force (especially given the increasing proliferation of nuclear technologies and the rise of asymmetric warfare). Furthermore, the lack of American manufacturing capacity has left it open to a significant loss of influence to the benefit of other regions, notably China (in Asia), and Germany (in the European Union).
China in particular will likely remain both a geopolitical and economic rival to the United States for the foreseeable future, especially as it already supersedes the United States in some areas of technology (such as 5G), and is increasingly becoming the locus of economic activity in Asia. As yet, Asia is by no means a cohesive economic or strategic bloc (such as the European Union), especially given the ongoing American influence in countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. But longer term, it is hard to believe that an independent democratic Japan would embrace a foreign policy stance that risks antagonizing a country of almost 1.4 billion people with nukes. According to some projections, by 2050 Japan will likely constitute about one-eighth of China’s GDP, South Korea much less. On the basis of that size disparity, strategic triangulation is a non-starter. Japan will no more be able to “balance” China than Canada today can “contain” the United States. It is likewise difficult to envisage Seoul continuing to have its own relations with the North being continuously subject to the vagaries of Pentagon politics in D.C. Heightening instability on the Korean peninsula is hardly in the long-term interests of either Seoul or Pyongyang.
By the same token, the idea of a broad but shallow trilateral United States-EU-Japan bloc against China is also a fantasy because the European Union, like Japan, increasingly finds its own interests clashing with those of the U.S. These tensions have manifested themselves fully in the current dispute over Huawei, China’s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer. The Europeans, especially Germany, may well be too invested in China to side with the United States in this particular dispute given its strong pre-existing commercial ties with the former, as Wolfgang Munchau’s Eurointelligence highlights:
“China is Germany’s biggest trading partner. Merkel continues to seek dialogue with China and insisted that ties with the country are of strategic importance to the EU. If this can be called a strategy it is clearly motivated by economic interests. These days, German car makers are dependent on the Chinese market, where record sales in Q2 compensated for the fallout from the pandemic in other markets, the FAZ reports.”
This also applies in the specific case of Huawei, where the U.S. is spearheading an attempt to limit the Chinese company’s global reach on national security grounds. Berlin in particular is seeking to balance the tensions of preserving an increasingly fraying relationship with the U.S. versus safeguarding emerging German commercial interests in China. The Merkel government is expected to make a definitive decision on Huawei by the autumn when the German parliament reconvenes; this will have significant implications for Europe as a whole, as an increasing number of EU member states are moving away from the firm’s 5G wares.
German political opinion remains sharply divided on the issue of Huawei. The decision is also complicated by the fact that “Deutsche Telekom, a 32%-state-owned company, is the country’s largest mobile provider and already relies heavily on Huawei equipment. It has lobbied strongly against any action that would make it harder for it to roll out 5G,” according to the Economist. If the Berlin government fails to follow the lead of the United Kingdom (which recently reversed an earlier decision to incorporate Huawei equipment in its growing 5G infrastructure), it will send a very powerful political signal in terms of how Germany prioritizes its long-term interests, which are no longer axiomatically tied to the U.S.
However Germany decides on Huawei, Atlanticism as a concept is largely dead in Europe. Even before the onset of the pandemic, for example, Italy had already become the first European country to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in response to ongoing economic stagnation. COVID-19 has, if anything, accelerated this Sinification of the Italian economy, given the ham-handed response of Brussels to the country’s plight (and which is still governed by old prevailing austerity biases). Although the tangible economic benefits of the BRI have likely been overstated, Rome-based journalist Eric Reguly has written:
“The Italian government rolled out the welcome mat to Chinese President Xi Jinping in part because it is desperate for foreign investment. Italy suffers from crushing youth unemployment and never fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis. It felt it was more or less abandoned by the U.S. and the rest of the EU on the investment front. The anti-EU sentiment among Italians rose during the migrant crisis, when other countries of the bloc refused to relieve Italy’s migrant burden, and rose again earlier this year, when Brussels ignored Italy’s initial pleas for help to fight COVID-19.”
It is important to note that Huawei is but a symptom of a broader EU disengagement from the U.S. Even if Huawei’s role in Europe’s future 5G networks is minimized, the big winners will be European companies, Nokia and Ericsson, not American ones. The 5G deficiency is but one illustration of how America’s failure to prioritize a robust manufacturing sector has contributed to a loss of influence and leverage in Europe.
That in turn explains the relatively tepid response to American pressure in many European capitals. Many EU member states have made the calculation that their interests are no longer inextricably tied to those of the U.S. One also sees this in response to American threats over new Russian natural gas pipelines, which the EU is largely ignoring. Europe has outgrown the suffocating embrace of Cold War exigencies.
The one outlier might well be the United Kingdom in its post-Brexit incarnation. Via the Five Eyes intelligence coordination among the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, it is possible that there will be a further tightening of the Anglosphere countries. Their current convergence on Huawei is one illustration of this, although Huawei’s Chief Digital Officer, Michael MacDonald, concedes that the battle over 5G dominance is small fry compared to “the total Digital Economy, which is generally accepted to contribute as much as 25% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025-26, [and] will be worth approximately $20 trillion, with 5G contributing just 0.2%.” And here the U.S. has everything to play for, given its ongoing dominance through American Big Tech behemoths such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.
As far as the U.S. itself goes, that also means a narrow but deep North America strategy (United States/Mexico/Canada), especially given the American government’s increasing proclivity to view economic warfare through the prism of national security considerations (as it did during the original Cold War). Those national security calculations have changed somewhat: In a reversal of old Cold War norms, whereby the strategic importance of Japan via America’s offshore naval presence was paramount, Mexico is now being prioritized, at least in regard to manufacturing and investment flows via the new North American trade agreement. As U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer writes in Foreign Affairs, the newly reconfigured United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement reinforces this trend by “overhaul[ing] the ‘rules of origin’ that govern trade in the… [automobile] sector,” increasing the threshold from 62.5 percent under the old NAFTA to 75 percent under the new USMCA.
These concerns are becoming bipartisan, as both parties are now tacking increasingly toward an overt form of economic nationalism.
Multipolarity need not usher in a Hobbesian-style world of eternal conflict. But as it becomes more of a reality, it signals the increasing eclipse of America as a preeminent superpower of one. Asia’s rise in particular simply returns the distribution of economic activity to what it was before the first industrial revolution. That’s not a bad thing, except for those rooted toward an embrace of American hegemony that must be retained at all costs, peacefully or by war. If anything, one could argue that America’s status as the world’s sole global superpower ushered in considerably greater global instability, given the absence of any restraining counterweight, as Washington went from one unilateral war of choice to another. A Joe Biden victory in November may temporarily arrest these trends, but the die has been cast.

Just days after he deployed federal officers to the streets of Portland, Oregon, his campaign released a 30-second television spot featuring an elderly white woman watching on her television the news of activists demanding a defunding of police. The woman shakes her head in disapproval as she notices a figure at her door trying to enter her house. She nervously calls 911, but apparently the activists she disapproves of have been so effective in their nefarious demands that the universal emergency hotline Americans rely on now goes unanswered. The vulnerable woman drops her remote control as the intruder enters her home, and we are only left to imagine the horror of what he does to her as the words “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America” appear on the screen. In this dystopian version of America, only Trump promises law and order.
Trump has repeatedly claimed that Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, supports the defunding of American police. He does not, and in fact, in keeping with his historic support for police, Biden has demanded increased funding for law enforcement. But Trump has already proven that he will not let truth get in the way of his desires, and therefore a little more digging on the part of voters and a little more forthright reporting on the part of journalists is necessary to understand exactly who is breaking American laws.
The paramilitary units from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that Trump has deployed to Portland have engaged in disturbing violations of human rights. They have used munitions to injure people, and acted like “thugs and goons” in the words of a Navy Veteran who was beaten with batons and pepper-sprayed in the face. They have arrested and detained people without documentation. Trump has defended their tactics saying the targets “are anarchists. These are not protesters… These are people that hate our country.”
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Director Chad Wolf took Trump’s characterization of protesters as “anarchists” to comical extremes in his public record of how and why his officers engaged with protesters. Saying that he “Condemns The Rampant Long-Lasting Violence In Portland,” Wolf used the words “violent” 76 times to describe what protesters have done to justify arrests and repression. Wolf’s definition of violence seems to almost entirely encompass property damage such as vandalism and graffiti. The closest that Portland protesters came to actual violence, it seems, was when they apparently, “attempted to cause eye damage to officers with commercial grade lasers,” and in another instance, “proceeded to launch aerial fireworks at federal property.”
The DHS records used the term “violent anarchists” 70 times and the term “protesters” only once, without making any effort to explain how exactly they distinguished “violent anarchists” from protesters, journalists or passersby. Nowhere in the document was there any documented behavior by protesters that came close to an attack on vulnerable elderly white women like the fictitious one in Trump’s ad. In not a single instance reported in the DHS account did a protester—or in Wolf’s words, violent anarchist—actually commit intentional violence against a human being.
Trump’s policy violates an idea that Republicans have long supported—that states ought to have the right to set their own laws and rules and that the federal government ought to respect that right. It also goes against the warnings that pro-gun Republicans have echoed for years—that mass gun ownership is necessary so that vigilant citizens can counter federal government tyranny of the sort that Trump has unleashed. Now that the kind of federal government overreach they have warned against for years is actually unfolding, there is nary a peep from the “gun rights” crowd.
It isn’t just Republicans who have embraced the march toward authoritarianism. Eighteen years ago Congress passed the Homeland Security Act to create the DHS—an agency with an Orwellian name—with 88 Democrats joining more than 200 Republicans in voting yes. The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks prompted a reconfiguring of American society and government that reverberates today, unleashing excessive surveillance and harsh immigration enforcement, while doing little to address the factors that provoked the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the first place.
Yet year after year, Democrats have voted to reauthorize the USA Patriot Act and other aspects of the post-9/11 authoritarian architecture. Now even as DHS officers are being deployed by a president they strongly criticize, Democratic lawmakers are trying to tie up funding for the DHS with that of the Department of Health and Human Services, which, according to the Intercept’s Ryan Grim, is “making it more difficult for progressive Democrats to oppose.”
But Trump has abused the infrastructure of the post-9/11 state repression to a far greater extent than either Presidents George W. Bush or President Barack Obama. The Washington Post reported that Tom Ridge, the notorious DHS secretary under Bush, denounced Trump’s move saying the agency was formed to counter “global terrorism,” and that, “It was not established to be the president’s personal militia.” A former Bush-era DHS official, Paul Rosenzweig, characterized the deployment as “lawful but awful,” while seeing the phenomenon as clearly unconstitutional. Michael Chertoff, another Bush-era DHS secretary, told a Washington Post columnist, “While it’s appropriate for DHS to protect federal property, that is not an excuse to range more widely in a city and to conduct police operations, particularly if local authorities have not requested federal assistance.” Chertoff added that Trump’s move is “very problematic,” and “very unsettling.” If those GOP officials who served under Bush—who were considered the political villains of their time—are disturbed, Trump has indeed crossed a line.
But another figure from the Bush years is rearing his head under Trump and encouraging his authoritarianism. John Yoo, the infamous lawyer who helped craft the “torture memos” during the Bush administration’s “war on terror” to justify the CIA’s use of torture during interrogations, is apparently advising the Trump administration on how best to use his executive power to skirt congressional authority, the Guardian reports. In June, Yoo wrote in an article in the National Review, “Even if Trump knew that his scheme lacked legal authority, he could get away with it for the length of his presidency.”
Trump has made clear that norms, ethics, laws, and even the U.S. Constitution are merely suggestions that mildly constrain him and that can be tossed aside when needed. His modus operandi is to push the limits of what he can do and dare the nation to stop him. Will we?

The newspaper reported Guilfoyle, who is dating Donald Trump, Jr. “was tasked with developing a network of mid-tier supporters who are seen as pivotal to Mr. Trump’s chances of winning a second term, and with whom he never formed a deep bond in 2016.”
“Guilfoyle made inroads with some of the donors who had rejected calls from others on Mr. Trump’s team. Yet Trump supporters inside and outside the campaign now say the operation she has built hasn’t lived up to the expectations of some Trump fund-raisers, and that her management style and that of some of her aides have alienated others,” the newspaper reported.
“Some of the problems have been attributed to the inability to conduct in-person fund-raising since the coronavirus pandemic began shutting down Mr. Trump’s donor events in March,” The Times reported. “But in interviews with The New York Times, Ms. Guilfoyle’s critics said that she had devoted a disproportionate amount of attention to glitzier, high-dollar fund-raising, and that they believed she used her position — and the fact that she’s seen as a de facto member of the Trump family — to support her public image and lifestyle.”
While most of the sources for the story were granted anonymity, oil executive Dan Eberhart went on-record.
“I think she likes the spotlight a little too much,” Eberhart, a Trump donor, explained.
The newspaper detailed staffing problems, with two members asking to be taken off her team.
“And a lavish birthday party for Ms. Guilfoyle at Mr. Trump’s Palm Beach club in March was partly funded by some campaign donors, which raised eyebrows,” the newspaper reported. “More concerning to some donors and campaign aides has been private plane use by Ms. Guilfoyle and her team, which has caught the eye of several staff members.
EDITOR’S NOTE: The author of this piece worked for Gavin Newsom’s 2003 mayoral campaign when Guilfoyle was married to the California Democrat. The campaign was successful, Guilfoyle went on to be first lady of San Francisco. The two divorced in 2006; Newsom currently serves as governor of California while Guilfoyle worked for Fox News for over a decade.

0,2020-07-24T22:57:08+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/why-decimated-manufacturing-communities-need-joe-bidens-build-back-better-campaign/,Why decimated manufacturing communities need Joe Biden’s Build Back Better campaign,"Rich Cucarese and other members of United Steelworkers (USW) Local 4889 tend a vegetable garden, cook meals and operate a food pantry for their neighbors in Philadelphia’s struggling Nicetown community.
Nicetown went into decline decades ago as corporations shut a string of factories, eliminating thousands of family-sustaining jobs that anchored the neighborhood. Blight festered, poverty soared, and government officials looked the other way.
Now, as much as Cucarese and his colleagues want to revitalize the community, there’s just no way they can do it on their own.
Reversing decades of decline and neglect—in Nicetown and other decimated manufacturing communities across America—will require bold, sustained action like what Joe Biden proposed in his Build Back Better manufacturing blueprint.
The Democratic presidential candidate envisions major investments in manufacturing, technology, and research and development that will create millions of middle-class jobs and revitalize hard-hit communities across the country.
Just as important, he wants to equitably distribute these new opportunities while providing the educational access and labor protections essential to ensuring that all citizens have a shot at the American dream.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which cost millions of jobs and exposed America’s struggle to produce critical goods like face masks, clearly demonstrated what residents of Nicetown have known for decades: Band-Aids and half measures aren’t enough. The nation needs sweeping, coordinated action to rebuild manufacturing capacity.
For all the damage they suffered, Nicetown and other beleaguered manufacturing communities still have potential.
Biden’s plan would unleash it.
“There are definitely people in the community who are trying everything they can to make the area viable,” said Cucarese, Local 4889’s Rapid Response coordinator and an assistant operator on the galvanizing line at U.S. Steel’s plant in Fairless Hills, about 25 miles from Nicetown. “There’s despair, but there’s also hope.”
Over the past quarter-century, America lost millions of manufacturing jobs, many because failed trade policies incentivized corporations to shift operations to countries with low wages and lax environmental regulations.
But employers also eliminated jobs because of bankruptcies, mergers and other reasons. The loss of family-sustaining wages gutted the middle class and sent manufacturing neighborhoods into a nosedive.
After Locals 404 of Philadelphia and 4889 of Fairless Hills consolidated in a Nicetown union hall about 18 months ago, Cucarese and a few of his colleagues explored the neighborhood.
They encountered the hulking remains of old factories but also good-hearted residents battling unemployment, troubled schools, hunger and unusually high rates of chronic health problems like asthma.
Nicetown’s struggles quickly galvanized the USW members into action. Cucarese told residents, “We’re here, and we’re not just here, but we’re here to help.”
He and his colleagues planted a community garden so they could provide fresh vegetables to residents who have difficulty affording nutritious meals. They not only held food drives for their neighbors but opened a food pantry in the union hall. They also rented office space to the Poor People’s Army, an anti-poverty group.
While these efforts have made a huge difference, only a sustained, coordinated investment campaign will provide the sweeping change needed to revive Nicetown and other depressed manufacturing communities.
That’s where a plan like Build Back Better can make the crucial difference.
It will not only make huge investments to stimulate the creation of manufacturing jobs but ensure that communities across the nation—especially long-neglected places—get a fair share of those jobs and the prosperity they provide.
Under Build Back Better, the nation would invest $300 billion in research, development and new technologies to fuel a reinvigorated manufacturing economy while spending another $400 billion on American-made goods.
Biden pledged to spend some of that money on the steel, aluminum and other materials needed to repair roads, bridges and other crumbling infrastructure. The funds also could be used to ramp up manufacturing capacity in pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and other critical industries so the nation never again experiences shortages of face masks and other important items like it did during the pandemic.
But new jobs themselves aren’t enough to rebuild the middle class and restore prosperity to struggling communities. Americans also need stronger labor protections to ensure they receive decent pay, good benefits and safe working conditions in return for their labor.
That’s why enacting the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which passed the House in February but languishes in the Republican-controlled Senate, is a key component of Biden’s manufacturing strategy.
The PRO Act would make it easier for workers to form unions and impose stiff penalties on employers who illegally interfere in organizing campaigns.
Just as the demise of American manufacturing sent communities into a tailspin, empowered workers in new middle-class jobs have the potential to turn neighborhoods around.
That’s the essence of Biden’s approach.
As incomes rise, fewer residents will rely on a safety net now stretched to the breaking point.
But residents crave a voice as much as they need investment.
Cucarese found that the key to building rapport with his neighbors was to listen to their concerns and make them partners in plans for food drives and other community service projects.
To realize his goal of revitalizing manufacturing communities, Biden likewise will have to collaborate closely with residents already laboring hard to make a difference.
These “ground forces,” as Cucarese calls them, know their neighbors’ needs better than anyone, and have more than earned a prominent part in their communities’ rebirth.
Empowering these residents will unleash the transformative potential envisioned in Build Back Better—and show that Biden’s plan isn’t merely a promise but his bond with struggling communities.
“If you show people that you’re being genuine,” Cucarese said, “they’ll jump in with both feet.”

0,2020-07-24T22:35:25+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/wealthy-opportunists-could-hijack-of-police-reform-weve-already-seen-the-playbook/,Wealthy opportunists could hijack police reform — we’ve already seen the playbook,"The Minneapolis City Council voted to disband the city’s police department on June 26, a little more than a month after George Floyd died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. Chauvin, along with three other officers who were there when Floyd was killed, has since been fired from the force and is now awaiting trial for Floyd’s death.
The city council vote does not automatically mean Minneapolis will no longer have a police department, of course. After a series of steps, the public will be asked to vote in November on an amendment regarding whether or not this course of action is the right one.
In June, a competing vision of police reform had been on the table in Minneapolis. Just as community-led initiatives were gaining traction, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo announced in June that his department would be using “real-time data” to overhaul its operations.
The work would be driven not by local grassroots groups, but instead by a Chicago-based company called Benchmark Analytics. Chief Arradondo announced on June 10 that the Minneapolis Police Department “would contract with Benchmark Analytics to identify problematic behavior early,” according to local NBC affiliate KARE 11.
Red flags flew up instantly, however, when this arrangement was made public.
For one thing, Benchmark Analytics is a private firm that promises to deliver an “all-in-one solution to advance police force management,” according to the company’s website, primarily through the use of algorithms that supposedly predict which officers may end up behaving “problematic[ally]” on the job.
This approach was at odds with the reallocation of resources from the police department to social services that many community leaders in Minneapolis and other cities are pushing for.
Another bone of contention involved funding, as it was reported that Benchmark Analytics’ reform model would be paid for by the Minneapolis Foundation, a philanthropic group led by a former mayor of the city, R.T. Rybak.
Activists, however, quickly seized upon the fact that not only did the proposed contract with Benchmark Analytics appear to have materialized without any public oversight, but Rybak himself is a founding board member of the firm. This prompted the Racial Justice Network to launch a petition criticizing “conflicts of interest” in the Minneapolis Foundation’s involvement in police reform.
On June 25, Rybak announced that the Minneapolis Foundation “has dropped its involvement.” A Minneapolis Police Department spokesman also said that “the department is trying to find alternative funding” for the Benchmark Analytics program; Mayor Jacob “Frey said if the city doesn’t find other funders, it will see if the program can be done with existing money.”
It seems unclear so far whether or not another funding source for Benchmark Analytics has been found. But in a July 14 interview with Minnesota Public Radio, while Mayor Frey did not mention Benchmark Analytics by name, he did tell radio host Cathy Wurzer that his plans for police reform will center on an “early intervention system that… uses evidence and data gathered by the University of Chicago.” (This description seems to align with the work of Benchmark Analytics, which is owned in part by the University of Chicago.)
Frey told Wurzer that the data gathered is intended to help the Minneapolis Police Department “weed… bad apples out” by predicting “which officers are more likely to have some sort of critical incident in the future.”
The push to bring in Benchmark Analytics was not the first time either Rybak or the Minneapolis Foundation has attempted to use power and wealth to push privatization plans on city residents—even though they often claim they are acting on behalf of marginalized people of color.
For evidence of how this approach can fail the public, look no further than the Minneapolis Public Schools, where a similar cast of characters and strategies have already been used to shake up the district’s schools. These “reform” efforts took Minneapolis schools down a failed path, and they stand as a warning sign of how attempts to rehabilitate police forces, in Minneapolis and elsewhere, can be subject to the same sort of misguided thinking and exploitation by opportunists.
Top-Down Reform for the Minneapolis Public Schools
For years, the Minneapolis school district has been subject to education reform tactics pushed by both right-wing and neoliberal groups, purportedly on behalf of the city’s most vulnerable students and families.
These tactics have included school choice schemes; a flawed, data-centric makeover of the district led by the global consulting group McKinsey & Company; and attempts to populate the local school board with market-based reform acolytes.
These local reform efforts are part of a national and ongoing trend, with representatives from both major political parties pursuing austerity and accountability reforms for public schools with the help of billionaire philanthropic outfits such as the Walton Family Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The focus of these efforts usually involves using data (primarily from high-stakes standardized tests) to push a crisis narrative around public education.
The crisis justifies the takeover of public entities, often for the exclusive benefit of plutocrats. Recent examples of this include New Orleans and Puerto Rico, where the disasters wrought by hurricanes Katrina and Maria, respectively, helped pave the way for privatization within the multibillion-dollar K-12 education market.
Elites Driving Change
In Minneapolis, initial attempts to push privatization schemes, primarily through the proliferation of highly segregated, privately run charter schools, took root during former mayor Rybak’s tenure.
Rybak was mayor of Minneapolis from 2002 to 2013, during which time he established himself as a press-ready politician who could both crowd-surf and whip city budgets into shape. At one point, he was dubbed a “leader of the American Progressive Movement” by fellow Democratic National Committee insider Howard Dean.
Rybak has a longstanding track record of aligning himself with neoliberal and pro-privatization forces. When he first became mayor in 2002, for example, he immediately opened the city’s doors to the controversial global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, whose operatives crafted a developer-friendly revamp for Minneapolis’s municipal structure.
As mayor, he had little direct control over the Minneapolis schools but still helped promulgate the idea that the achievement gap between white students and students of color—a concept that has been deemed racist by observers such as Ibram X. Kendi—is best solved through top-down initiatives funded by elites.
In 2007, he was the only person to publicly speak before the Minneapolis school board in favor of closing a handful of schools on the city’s historically Black north side, for example, even as scores of community members rallied on behalf of keeping them open.
Then, a few years later, he signed off on a document known as the District-Charter Collaboration Compact, which came to Minneapolis through the Center on Reinventing Public Education—a nonprofit based in Washington state that has been a leading force in the privatization of public education across the country, from Indianapolis to New Orleans and many points in between.
The compact was signed in 2010 by Rybak and a list of other local school and civic leaders, who all promised to tackle the test score-based achievement gap by “working to close, reconstitute, or by other means immediately address persistently low-performing schools, whether district or charter.”
Churn, Churn, Churn
This embodies the churn approach to school reform, with constant streams of student and teacher data being used to declare winners and losers in the education marketplace. Any innovation, disruption, or deregulation is worth a try in this scenario, if it can be used to boost numbers and tell a “beat the odds” story of success.
So far, there has been little to show for the get-tough promises spelled out in the District-Charter Collaboration Compact as the metrics the plan was intended to address continue to reflect a statewide problem with serving high-needs students, as reported by the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2019.
Instead, the crisis narrative continues to dog the Minneapolis Public Schools. In fact, it is still being used to justify extreme measures, including the district’s current restructuring plan, which was voted in just as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold—against the wishes of many grassroots community groups.
Rybak left the mayor’s office in 2013. On his way out, he told reporters that he “wishes he’d spent more of his 12 years in office trying to improve the city’s schools.”
Data-Driven Police Reform
What he did do, however, was walk out of the mayor’s office and into a position as head of a local data-driven education reform initiative, Generation Next, before taking over as head of the Minneapolis Foundation in 2016 and, according to 2017 tax records, nabbing an annual salary of around $340,000.
That salary, by the way, is nearly 10 times what the average Black family in Minneapolis earns each year, according to a May 2020 Washington Post analysis of 2018 Census Bureau data.
The Minneapolis Foundation, both before and during Rybak’s leadership, has pumped millions of dollars into school choice models in the Twin Cities. This includes support for some charter schools whose enrollment data appear to support racial segregation, such as (as of 2017) KIPP Minnesota, where nearly 96 percent of students are Black, according to 2019-2020 state data. (The Minneapolis Foundation’s number one grant recipient in education as of 2018 was the elite Blake School, where tuition runs as high as $34,000 per student annually.)
While Rybak has held high-profile positions in education, it seems he has emerged unscathed from the misguided market-based, data-dependent education reform initiatives he has backed.
Instead, it was his recent attempt to insert himself and the Minneapolis Foundation into police reform efforts that amounted to a day of reckoning for Rybak. When it became known that the Minneapolis Foundation, with Rybak at the helm, was attempting to drive police reform efforts, local activists quickly pushed back.
They had ample reason to do so.
Communities Thwart Privatized Police Reform
Much in the same way that privatizers and opportunists applied accountability measures to teachers and schools as a way to “improve outcomes,” while sidestepping broader conversations about wealth inequality and structural racism, supporters of data-driven reform are targeting police departments and police officers for a similar makeover, thanks to outfits like Benchmark Analytics.
There has been “increasing use of surveillance technologies by local police across America,” according to the ACLU. But from body cameras worn by police officers to predictive crime software, all the data and technology in the world has done little to improve policing, many experts say, and has in fact been more of a boon to police departments who often use it against the very communities they are supposed to be protecting.
And that raises another key point: a data-driven approach funded by elites is not the same thing as allowing community members to guide police reform in their own neighborhoods. Activists said as much at a June 22 press conference, held to call out Rybak and the Minneapolis Foundation on their record of failing to curb police brutality and to cooperate with the community on the issue.
Groups such as Communities United Against Police Brutality, which used the hashtag #StepBackRybak in a Facebook post that shared the Racial Justice Network petition and criticized Rybak’s connection with Benchmark Analytics, and the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations convened the media event in front of current Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey’s office.
As mayor, Rybak “failed miserably” where police accountability is concerned, Michelle Gross of Communities United Against Police Brutality said forcefully at the press conference. As chair of a civilian review board tasked with developing recommendations for the police as far back as 2002, Gross alleged that Rybak showed disregard for the community’s work and in fact had a “secret plan to gut” their efforts.
Local civil rights attorney, activist, and founder of the Racial Justice Network Nekima Levy Armstrong echoed Gross’s criticism of Rybak. Armstrong, who once sat on the Minneapolis Foundation’s board, called Rybak to task for “allowing the Minneapolis Police Department to get out of control” while racial disparities in the city grew larger.
“He now has the audacity to… [act] as if he is an expert on addressing police accountability,” she told the small crowd of reporters gathered at the press conference. “We are calling on the Minneapolis Foundation board, their trustees and their donors… to stop allowing… [Rybak] to gaslight the Black community,” Armstrong stated.
Their strategy worked.
Within a few days, the Minneapolis Foundation announced that it was withdrawing its funding for the Benchmark Analytics program. This was an impressive check on Rybak’s power.
So for now, it looks like police reform efforts in Minneapolis will stay out of the hands of such opportunists, thanks to pressure from local activists and their supporters.
Still, the legacy of supporting neoliberal education reform and privatization for the city’s public school system remains intact. In the coming months, the Minneapolis Public Schools district is set to embark on an ambitious overhaul designed to “right-size” the district in the face of steep budget and enrollment shortages.
But these drops in funding and public school enrollment numbers in Minneapolis were catalyzed by the funding and support for school choice and data-driven accountability schemes at the expense of the city’s public school system. The kind of grassroots activism seen in Minneapolis in the fight against a misguided police reform program is a useful model and could help end these efforts to undermine and privatize public schools.

0,2020-07-24T21:54:54+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/dr-fauci-faces-barrage-of-abuse-and-threats-as-the-white-house-turned-on-him/,Dr. Fauci faces barrage of abuse and threats as the White House turned on him,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he and his family had been assigned a security detail after receiving “serious threats” amid public attacks from members of the Trump administration.
Polls show that Fauci is one of the most trusted sources of information about the coronavirus, which apparently irks President Donald Trump at the same time as it undercuts his attempts to downplay the threat posed by the pandemic. Trump himself cited Fauci’s high ratings in a tweet last month, and The Washington Post reported that he was “galled” by the numbers. The White House recently sent an “oppo dump” seeking to discredit Fauci to reporters, and Trump adviser Peter Navarro also published a USA Today op-ed claiming that Fauci was “wrong about everything.”
Against this backdrop, Fauci told CNN this week that he and his family had also been deluged with “serious threats,” prompting concern for their safety. Fauci said he had received plenty of hate during his time working on the federal response to the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s — but nothing like the recent wave of disturbing messages.
“I’ve seen a side of society that I guess is understandable, but it’s a little bit disturbing,” he said in an interview on “The Axe Files” podcast. “Back in the days of HIV when I was being criticized with some hate mail, it was, you know, people calling me a ‘gay-lover.’ And, ‘What the hell are you wasting a lot of time on that?’ I mean, things that you would just push aside as stupid people saying stupid things.”
But the attacks this year are “really a magnitude different now, because of the anger,” he added.
“As much as people inappropriately, I think, make me somewhat of a hero — and I’m not a hero, I’m just doing my job — there are people who get really angry at thinking I’m interfering with their life, because I’m pushing a public-health agenda,” he told host David Axelrod, adding that he had received “not only hate mail but also serious threats.”
“It’s not good. I don’t see how society does that,” he said. “It’s tough. Serious threats against me, against my family . . . my daughters, my wife — I mean, really? Is this the United States of America?”
Despite the attacks aimed at Fauci and his family, the Trump administration has continued to try to undermine him in the press.
The White House sent countless reporters a list of times in which Fauci “has been wrong” about the coronavirus. It was “laid out in the style of a campaign’s opposition research document,” according to a New York Times reporter.
The “oppo dump” was followed by Navarro’s bizarre op-ed urging the public to respond to Fauci’s advice with “skepticism and caution.” Backlash over the op-ed prompted USA Today to issue a correction.
“Several of Navarro’s criticisms of Fauci — on the China travel restrictions, the risk from the coronavirus and falling mortality rates — were misleading or lacked context,” USA Today editorial page editor Bill Sternberg said. “As such, Navarro’s op-ed did not meet USA TODAY’s fact-checking standards.”
The White House sought to distance itself from the op-ed, but he did not repudiate Navarro’s comments.
“We’re all on the same team, including Dr. Fauci,” Trump told reporters, adding that Navarro “shouldn’t be doing that.”
But that same week, Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff for communications and one of Trump’s closest advisers, shared a cartoon depicting Fauci as “Dr. Faucet,” drowning Uncle Sam by issuing advice to stay at home and close schools to contain the spread of the virus.
Trump himself has described Fauci as a “little bit of an alarmist” in an interview with Fox News earlier this week.
Fauci called the attacks from the administration “bizarre.”
“I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that,” Fauci told The Atlantic earlier this month. “I think they realize now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it’s only reflecting negatively on them.”

Except, as the show would later point out, this was just another one of McEnany’s many lies and falsehoods.
So how did McEnany come to spread false information about a popular kids’ program? Unsurprisingly, no reporter asked her about “Paw Patrol.” She brought it up herself in a screed against “cancel culture,” a nebulous idea that the president has latched on to in hopes that he can use the culture wars to win re-election.
“He’s also opposed to cancel culture, and cancel culture specifically as it pertains to cops,” she said. “We saw a few weeks ago that ‘Paw Patrol,’ a cartoon show about cops, was canceled. The show ‘Cops’ was canceled. ‘Live PD’ was canceled. Lego halted the sales of their Lego City Police Station. It’s really unfortunate.”
McEnany was correct that “Cops” and “Live PD” were canceled. She’s wrong about Lego, which is still selling police station sets, and she was wrong about “Paw Patrol,” as the show made clear on Twitter:
It’s a small thing to get wrong, and of course, we can all make mistakes. But McEnany’s briefings are frequently filled with error-laden rants and ideologically driven attacks on the media, showing little interest in actually informing the American people about important issues affecting their daily lives. The incident highlights that she doesn’t think of her job as communicating vital news to the public, but propagandizing purely for the president’s benefit.  Meanwhile, she often has convenient lapses in her knowledge on key political issues of the day.
“The sad part is that someone in the White House wrote up this random piece of misinformation for the press secretary to read from her binder,” said CNN reporter Kevin Liptak, “but no one thought to check whether Trump had raised Taliban bounties or election interference with Putin (‘I was not on that call.’)”

For many people in the U.S., getting tested for COVID-19 is a struggle. In Arizona, testing sites have seen lines of hundreds of cars stretching over a mile. In Texas and Florida, some people were waiting for five hours for free testing.
The inconvenience of these long waits alone discourages many people from getting tested. With the surge in cases, many public testing sites have been reaching maximum capacity within hours of opening, leaving many people unable to get tested for days. Those that do get tested often face a week-long wait to get their test results.
Every person who isn’t tested could be spreading COVID-19 unknowingly. These overstretched testing programs are a weak link in the U.S. pandemic response.
I study public health policy to combat infectious disease epidemics. The key to overcoming this pandemic is to slow transmission of the virus by preventing contagious people from infecting others. A widespread quarantine would accomplish this, but is economically and socially burdensome. Testing offers a way to identify contagious people so they can be isolated to prevent the spread of the disease. This is especially important for COVID-19 because an estimated 40% or more of all people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have few or no symptoms so testing is the only way to identify them.
Some states are doing much better than others. But as a whole, the U.S. is falling far short of the amount of testing needed to control the pandemic. What are the challenges the U.S. is facing? And what is the way forward?
Testing should be free, easy, fast and accurate
The ultimate goal of testing is for everyone, regardless of symptoms, to know at all times whether they are infected with the coronavirus. To achieve this level of testing, tests should be free, very easy to perform and provide accurate results quickly.
Ideally, free COVID-19 tests would be delivered to everyone directly. The tests would be simple to perform – like a saliva test – and would give a perfectly accurate result within minutes. Everyone could test themselves weekly or anytime they were going to be in close contact with other people.
In this ideal scenario, most, if not all, contagious people would be detected before they could spread the virus to others. And because of the rapid results, there would be no burden of quarantining between doing the test and getting the result.
Researchers are working on better-quality tests, but access is a problem of infrastructure, not science. Right now, nowhere in the U.S. comes close to meeting surging demand for testing.
One of the worst cases: Texas
The difficulty of getting a COVID-19 test varies by state, but currently, people in Texas face some of the biggest obstacles, which results in far fewer tests being done than is needed to control the pandemic.
First, Houston – which is experiencing a surge in cases – and many testing sites across the state recommend or offer testing only to people who have symptoms, were exposed to a COVID-19 case or are a member of a high-risk group.
Even people recommended for testing still face challenges. It is possible to request an appointment for a free COVID-19 test, but testing facilities can handle only so many patients a day and testing slots fill up quickly. Even if someone gets an appointment, they may face an hours-long wait at the testing site.
Finally, public health experts recommend that people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 should quarantine at home for 14 days or until they receive a negative test result. In Texas, patients are supposed to get results through an online portal in three to five days, but many labs have been taking seven to nine days to return results. These long delays mean people face a much higher burden of quarantining while waiting for results.
All of these challenges make it clear that Texas is simply not testing enough people to keep the spread of COVID-19 in check.
To gauge the success of COVID-19 testing programs, epidemiologists use a measure called test positivity. This is simply the percentage of tests that come back positive. The lower the test positivity, the better, because that means very few cases are going undetected. A high test-positivity rate is usually a sign that only the sickest people are getting tested and many cases are being missed.
The World Health Organization guidelines say that if more than 1 out of 20 COVID-19 tests comes back positive – a test positivity of more than 5% – this is an indication that a lot of cases are not diagnosed and the epidemic is not under control. Texas currently has a test-positivity of around 16%, which means that a lot of infected people are not getting tested and may be unknowingly spreading the disease.
One of the best cases: New Mexico
In stark contrast to Texas is New Mexico, which has one of the strongest testing programs in the U.S.
First, public health officials there encourage everyone to get tested for COVID-19 regardless of symptoms or exposure. The state has also prohibited health providers from charging patients for tests. People seeking a test have the option to walk in or to make an appointment ahead of time, whichever is more convenient.
All of this relatively good access to testing has resulted in one of the highest per capita testing rates in the country, at over 20,000 tests per 100,000 people, and a test-positivity rate of around 4%. New Mexico’s testing program is diagnosing a relatively high proportion of cases despite the state experiencing a recent surge.
New Mexico still has room for improvement. Long lines, wait times and limited capacity are becoming more common as cases surge, but the foundation of a strong testing program has helped the state cope with the increase in cases.
The big-picture problems
The pre-pandemic infectious disease testing capabilities in the U.S. are clearly unable to meet the current demand. A nationwide response is needed, and there are three things that Congress, the federal government and local governments can do to help ensure COVID-19 tests will be easy to get, fast and accurate.
First, Congress can provide funding to stimulate the testing supply chain, scale up existing testing programs and promote innovation in test development. Second, governments can improve the management and coordination of testing programs to more efficiently use existing resources. And third, innovative testing methods that reduce the need for lab capacity – like paper-strip tests and pooled testing – need be approved and implemented more quickly.
Every little improvement in testing capabilities means more COVID-19 cases can be caught before the virus is transmitted. And slowing the spread of the virus is the key to overcoming the pandemic.

0,2020-07-24T20:29:56+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-why-everyone-is-suddenly-talking-about-karen-bass-as-bidens-potential-vp/,Here’s why everyone is suddenly talking about Karen Bass as Biden’s potential VP,"The Democratic women who have often been mentioned as a possible running mate for former Vice President Joe Biden include Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Rep. Val Demings and Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House of Representatives minority leader who narrowly lost a gubernatorial campaign to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2018. In Politico, reporters Christopher Cadelago and Natasha Korecki on Friday analyzed another possibility that is suddenly receiving a lot of attention: Rep. Karen Bass of California.
“In many ways, Karen Bass is the anti-Kamala Harris,” Cadelago and Korecki write. “And yet, the Californians have ended up in a similar spot: on Joe Biden’s vice presidential shortlist.”
The Politico reporters explain what they mean by calling the 66-year-old Bass “the anti-Kamala Harris.” Bass, they observe, is “content to let others grab headlines” — and “her personal qualities starkly contrast with Harris” because she is “persuasive but not flashy.”
Nonetheless, they note, Bass (who, in 2018, was chosen to chair the Congressional Black Caucus) “has seen her profile rise of late amid the twin crises of the coronavirus pandemic and national reckoning with racism. Her standing in the VP search has improved based on private assessments shared with Biden’s team.”
Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa weighed in on Bass’ appeal, telling Politico: “The reason she’s gone from a name bandied about to a serious contender is because the more you look at her, the more you realize what a perfect choice for the time she is.”
The most important issue facing America right now is a pandemic that has killed 144,000 Americans and the economic free-fall that has transpired because of it.
It’s time to end the nightmare this country has endured for the past three and a half years.
— Karen Bass (@KarenBassTweets) July 24, 2020
According to Cadelago and Korecki, Bass has “already undergone intense scrutiny from the campaign — including a half-day interview with Biden representatives that a friend described as ‘invasive’ — and has advanced deep into the vice presidential process, according to three people familiar with the vetting.”
Upon seeing Politico’s article, Bass disagreed with being called “the anti-Kamala Harris” and tweeted:
Senator Kamala Harris has spent her entire life fighting for the people. I would never want to be labeled the “anti-Kamala Harris.” We’re fortunate to have had her as Attorney General and now as Senator. She would be an excellent VP and the same goes for anyone else on the list. https://t.co/CA4nuTaOia
— Karen Bass (@KarenBassTweets) July 24, 2020
Despite the attention Bass is receiving from Biden’s campaign, Cadelago and Korecki explain that she “would still have to overcome long odds: the extent of her personal rapport with Biden, whom she didn’t know well at the onset of the process, remains unclear. As does how she would handle the scrutiny and pressures of the role. She is a virtual unknown in most of the country, and unlike Harris, hasn’t been vetted or gone through the rigors of a national campaign.”
The liberal Bass has drawn praise from some conservatives, including Washington Post columnist George Will — who has spoken highly of her calm demeanor — and Jim Brulte, former chairman of the California Republican Party.
But she has also won the praise of progressives within the Democratic Party. In a recent letter to Biden, a group of California delegates for Sen. Bernie Sanders cited Bass as a strong potential VP, along with former Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner and Rep. Barbara Lee of California.
“There are a lot of people in politics who are well liked, and there are a lot of people in politics who are well respected,” Brulte told Politico. “But there aren’t a lot of people who are well liked and well respected. Karen is one of them.”

“Today the nation’s top counterintelligence officials said that Russia is one of three countries that is actively working to interfere in our election. Did the president bring up election interference on the call with the Russian president yesterday?” asked CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins.
“Again, I wasn’t on the call, but the president — I was not on the call, the president — the president has taken more actions for election security than his predecessor, who gave a stand-down order when he learned about election interference, Susan Rice gave that stand-down order,” McEnany replied.
“By contrast, we have given a ton of funding to election security, we take our elections seriously and we believe in election integrity,” she added.
“My question is did President Trump bring it up on the call?” Collins asked, but McEnany refused to answer.
“Justin? Justin?” McEnany said. “I was not on the call, Kaitlan, stop filibustering.”
“You didn’t answer my question,” Collins shot back.
“Justin? Justin? Okay, Justin no longer has a question. Anyone else?” McEnany said, moving on.

John McCain of Arizona. But when the president’s niece, Mary Trump, appeared on “The View” this week, McCain was critical of her new tell-all book, “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man” — which is the top-selling book on Amazon and sold 1.35 million copies during its first week, according to publisher Simon & Schuster.
In a tense interview, the 55-year-old author pushed back against McCain’s insinuation that she was motivated by a desire for some type of “revenge” and to get rich.
“I think I’ve made it clear to your publishers: I don’t like books like this,” McCain told Mary Trump. “I don’t like family tell-all books, especially when it comes to families with fame and power, because they’re told from the one side — and often, the subjects are villainized to the point that I don’t actually end up believing the stuff written. There’ve been books written about my family which are complete and total garbage, told from a skewed perspective. And at the end of the day, you get a really good paycheck out of it. But I don’t think it’s that legitimate. What do you say to people like me who think this is just a really good way for you to get a paycheck right now?”
.@MeghanMcCain to Mary Trump: “What do you say to people like me who think this is just a great way for you to get a paycheck right now?”
Trump: “If I had wanted to cash in… I would have done this ten years ago… and I would not have been taking the risks that I’m taking.” pic.twitter.com/grPPGHYcHt
— The View (@TheView) July 23, 2020
Trump’s response to McCain was calm and matter-of-fact, not angry to overly defensive, when she explained, “I think if you read the book, you see that I bring to the story my very deep experience within the family. I’m not some stranger writing it; I’m his niece.”
Mary Trump is the daughter of the late Fred Trump, Jr., one of President Trump’s brothers and the son of family patriarch, Fred Trump, Sr. In her book, she describes Fred Trump, Sr. as a highly domineering man who was furious with her father for pursuing a career in aviation rather than working in the family’s real estate business — and she alleges that some of President Trump’s worst qualities came from his desire to please his father.
The author described her book as a “narrative…. about my family and how Donald became the person that he is,” telling McCain, “If I had wanted some measure of revenge — if I had wanted to cash in, as you say, I would have done this ten years ago when Donald was still a very public figure and I would not have been taking the risks that I’m taking. We’ve all seen how whistleblowers fare in this administration. So, I would have much preferred not to do this, but I felt it was extremely important that the American people have all of the information they need in order to make an informed decision.”
McCain, however, questioned how many insights Mary Trump really has about her family since she isn’t close to her cousins, Donald Trump, Jr. and Ivanka Trump Kushner. And the author responded that her relationship with her cousins is irrelevant to the subject matter in her book.
Trump told McCain, “I’m not entirely sure why you’re so focused on my cousins, who, again, are so much younger than I am….. I think to focus on these things is to take away from the actually important things I write about in the book.”
See some responses to the interview below:
There is a 20 year age gap between Mary & her cousins. They wouldn’t be super tight. Just like the age gap between John McCains kids from his 1st family and #MeghanMcCain. Johns first family has said they aren’t tight with Megan. #theview

Can you please hire a conservative who is not entitled. I don’t mind the challenges but the ‘me, me, me’ of ME-ghan McCain is exhausting to watch. I am really ready to stop watching if you don’t start limiting her time and making it more equal. I don’t tune in to watch her.
— Kristine Spencer (@HRH_KRS) July 23, 2020
the interview was almost a failure. @MeghanMcCain as always attacking and talking about me me me. The only one who asked interesting questions was @JoyVBehar. Mary Trump is very intelligent. Apparently if the person they interview is smart, they struggle with the interview.
— Regina Garza (@gina7491) July 23, 2020
I figured Meghan wouldn’t have read the book but try to tear her down. READ THE BOOK. There is nothing surprising in it, but it does explain a lot. Anyone who has empathy can feel for the little boy @realDonaldTrump was, but there is no excuse for the monster @POTUS has become.
— Crystal (@Crstl_M_Romero) July 23, 2020
Why is she allowed to speak to people like that, she puts herself in the position of expert. She rude and obnoxious how dare she speak to this woman this way. She owes her a public apology.
— coleen carr (@coleencarr11) July 23, 2020
What a condescending little brat. I just finished Mary’s book, Meghan should read it too. It explains so much about the dynamic of the family and why DJT is the way he is. She was so disrespectful to Mary, but she handled herself so well. Bravo Mary!!

Doctor: There’s good news and bad news.
Patient: What’s the bad news?
Doctor: We amputated the wrong leg.
Patient: Oh my god! What’s the good news?
Doctor: The other one’s getting better.
Trump is trying to sell us a little bit of dubious good news here and there while distracting us from the bad, especially the non-stop multitude of unenforced fatal errors made by this president and his Republican pals, in particular the governors of now disease-ridden red states who did his bidding and opened their states too early.
He’s covering up bad news like the fact that on Tuesday, for the first time since May, the United States recorded more than 1000 coronavirus deaths for the day. Or that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the number of infections probably is two to thirteen times higher than we officially know. Or eighteen straight weeks of more than a million Americans filing unemployment claims as a result of the shutdown.
Instead, he’s pushing his usual snake oil—“My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable!”—exaggerating the truth, spinning the statistics and downright lying while still claiming the virus “will disappear.” Which makes it all the more peculiar to hear the media talking afterwards about Donald Trump’s “change of tone.” All he’s done is perform his usual dreary read off the teleprompter, avoiding disastrous ad libs and sounding for all the world like the kid forced to recite in front of the grownups before he can have cake.

Granted, he did admit for the first time that the pandemic “will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better.” And he does now express his support for wearing a mask, claiming that he carries one with him and wears it—although I can think of only two instances when he was seen with one on his face and on Monday night, video showed him cavorting around without a mask or social distancing at a fundraiser in his DC hotel. Nonetheless, wearing it, he says, is about patriotism. Bless our Yankee Doodle Dunce.
So change of tone? Not really. For one, you just know he’ll be back to his usual maniacal stand-up act any minute now. For another, he’s clearly not just satisfying his craven lust for airtime but responding to polls showing a majority of the country disapprove his handling of COVID-19 and distrust anything he says about the virus. He’s also trying to win back his eroding support among seniors, not only by singling out the importance of their medical care in the briefings—“high risk, wonderful people” (!)—but by trying to scare them with bogus reports of anarchists flooding the streets and criminals on the rampage assaulting little old ladies if Joe Biden’s elected.
What’s more, Trump seems to know that his bungling of coronavirus is creating cracks in his support among his GOP stalwarts. According to Sunday’s New York Times, “Once-reticent Republican governors are now issuing orders on mask-wearing and business restrictions that run counter to Mr. Trump’s demands. Some of those governors have been holding late-night phone calls among themselves to trade ideas and grievances; they have sought out partners in the administration other than the president, including Vice President Mike Pence, who, despite echoing Mr. Trump in public, is seen by governors as far more attentive to the continuing disaster.”
An advisor to Texas Governor Greg Abbott told the paper that Trump “got bored” with the virus and was doing nothing. So some Republican senators have been telling the president to at least resume the COVID briefings—albeit wanting him to do so with his medical advisors and not solo, as he has been doing this week.
It also should come as no surprise that Trump has resumed the briefings because he so desperately wants to distract from and cover up his immoral, ineffective and corrupt conduct throughout this crisis.  Recent expert reporting by both The New York  Times and The Washington Post make his spectacular blundering even clearer.
The reviews are in: A Post investigative team wrote, “The fumbling of the virus was not a fluke: The American coronavirus fiasco has exposed the country’s incoherent leadership, self-defeating political polarization, a lack of investment in public health, and persistent socioeconomic and racial inequities that have left millions of people vulnerable to disease and death…
While other countries endured some of the same setbacks, few have suffered from all of them simultaneously and catastrophically. If there was a mistake to be made in this pandemic, America has made it.
The Times team reported, “Mr. Trump’s bet that the crisis would fade away proved wrong. But… the approach he embraced was not just a misjudgment. Instead, it was a deliberate strategy that he would stick doggedly to as evidence mounted that, in the absence of strong leadership from the White House, the virus would continue to infect and kill large numbers of Americans…
The real-world consequences of Mr. Trump’s abdication of responsibility rippled across the country…. Other nations had moved aggressively to employ an array of techniques that Mr. Trump never mobilized on a federal level, including national testing strategies and contact tracing to track down and isolate people who had interacted with newly diagnosed patients…
By early June, it was clear that the White House had gotten it wrong.
James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association, told The Post, “You look at the Great Depression and how Roosevelt made a concerted effort to unite the country—the fireside chats, the New Deal. That is the instinctive reaction of almost every president in crisis. Even if you don’t succeed, you try to convince people that they’re all in this together. This presidency is the exception and anomaly.”
Exception, anomaly, catastrophe. He is, of course, doing his favorite thing (besides talking about himself)—shifting blame, even implying on Wednesday that the increase in cases—now more than four million, the most in the world—is in part due to the Black Lives Matter protests and Mexico. Thank goodness for that barely existent wall! And on Thursday, not only did he announce the cancellation of his big nominating shindig next month in Jacksonville but that, “The country is in very good shape, other than if you look South and West. Some problems. It’ll all work out.”
Sure thing, Mr. President sir. It’s the same old song—the self-deception that believes the lie. So here’s my good news/bad news story. Bad news: he’s still the president, still a disaster. Good news: November is coming.

0,2020-07-24T18:51:54+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/republicans-get-raked-over-the-coals-for-leaving-town-as-fiscal-cliff-looms-going-to-lead-to-desperation-for-millions/,Republicans get raked over the coals for leaving town as fiscal cliff looms: ‘Going to lead to desperation for millions’,"Sen. Ron Wyden excoriated his Republican colleagues in a floor speech Thursday as they prepared to skip town for the weekend without finalizing a plan to extend the $600-per-week boost in unemployment benefits set to expire in just two days, leaving 30 million Americans without a key financial lifeline.
“Here’s the message that I think the folks who are walking on an economic tightrope this weekend need to hear: On this side of the aisle, we’ve been ready to go for weeks, essentially months,” Wyden said, referring to Senate Democrats. “As of this afternoon, with benefits expiring in two days, the other side of the aisle has no piece of legislation on offer.”
“They write lots of bills to help multinational corporations, lots of bills to help the powerful and the special interests,” said the Oregon Democrat. “But as of this afternoon, there is not a bill to help those folks who this weekend are going to be saying, ‘We’re not going to be able to make rent in a few days, we’re not going to be able to feed our families, not going to be able to pay for the car insurance.'”
Wyden, one of the architects of the $600-per-week unemployment insurance boost, introduced legislation with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on July 1 to extend the enhanced payments until a state’s average unemployment rate falls below 11% over a period of three months. The benefit would then be reduced by $100 for every percentage point the unemployment rate falls until it dips below 6%.
Instead of negotiating with Senate Democrats over the unemployment benefits in the weeks before expiration of the $600 weekly payments, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) “actively gave short shrift to the needs of the unemployed,” said Wyden.
As Common Dreams reported Wednesday, McConnell laughed off the possibility of passing coronavirus relief legislation by the end of next week. The last unemployment check with the $600 boost is set to go out on Saturday in 49 states and Sunday in New York.
“The pain that working families have this weekend didn’t have to happen,” the Oregon Democrat said. “The lapse that is being forced on this country right now is because Senate Republicans would not step up… The lapse is going to lead to evictions, it’s going to lead to hunger, it’s going to lead to desperation for millions of Americans.”
Watch:
Senate Republicans were expected to release their coronavirus stimulus package Thursday but were forced to delay the bill until Monday amid intraparty disagreements over key issues, including what to do about the enhanced unemployment benefits.
“Mnuchin and President Trump have said publicly that they want to have the new payments replace roughly ’70 percent’ of a worker’s prior income,” the Washington Post reported Friday. “Republican lawmakers have discussed extending the flat payment at about $200-per-week instead of $600 to give the states time to adjust to the new formula and system as part of this plan.”
Josh Bivens, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, estimated in a blog post Friday that “reducing the enhanced unemployment payments would strip away enough aggregate demand from the economy to slow growth in gross domestic product (GDP) by 3.7% over the next year.”
“This slower growth would result in 5.1 million fewer jobs created over the next year,” Bivens warned. “The big constraint on economic growth right now is the spread of the coronavirus. If we allow the $600 supplement to lapse, another huge constraint on growth will be imposed—collapsing incomes for the tens of millions of U.S. families that had to rely on these benefits in recent months.”

0,2020-07-24T18:35:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-very-stable-genius-plan-to-win-re-election-will-be-a-total-flop/,Trump’s very-stable-genius plan to win re-election will be a total flop,"In 2018, Donald Trump’s very-stable-genius plan to win the midterm elections for Republicans was to hype the hell out of a so-called caravan of Central American refugees who were crossing Mexico in hopes of seeking asylum in the United States. About 7,000 people, mostly consisting of families with children, were indeed making the 2,500-mile trek to escape poverty and gang violence, but Trump and his Republican sycophants tried to convince American voters that they were coming to the U.S. to kill white people and burn down the suburbs. Through his preferred media of Twitter and Fox News, Trump endlessly hyped the “invasion” of these migrants, and suggesting they might be terrorists, and were coming to create gang warfare, not escape it.
The nonstop fear-mongering about the caravan did work its magic on the ever-gullible mainstream news media. A Media Matters study published two weeks before the election showed a precipitous rise in cable news coverage of what would have otherwise been a minor story, as similar caravans had been in previous years.
But if Trump and his minions succeeded in hijacking the news cycle with their racist hysterics, they failed in their goal of winning the 2018 midterm elections. While Republicans certainly leveraged their unfair electoral advantages to maintain a wildly disproportionate share of power, Democrats racked up historic wins, retaking the House of Representatives with a 40-seat pickup, as well as winning seven governorships and hundreds of state legislature seats.
While the news media let Trump’s racist hype machine around the caravan drive their coverage, the actual voters were worried about an issue that had fallen out of the headlines 15 months prior: Health care, by far the biggest concern cited by voters in 2018 exit polls.
Trump and the Republicans had tried to repeal the Affordable Health Care in the summer of 2017, failing only at the last minute when Sen. John McCain voted against the effort. But while McCain may have blunted the impact slightly, Democrats were still able to run a bunch of ads and hold numerous events highlighting the fact that Trump wanted to take away people’s health insurance. The strategy worked not only to win that election, but to keep the health care issue central to voters’ concerns, no matter how much Trump was hyping racist fears.
Now it’s time for another, even more important election and Trump, never one to believe that he was wrong just because he failed, is pulling out the same playbook. He’s replaced “caravan” with phrases like “professional anarchists, violent mobs or arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, antifa,” all terms he uses to describe the largely peaceful protesters who have been demonstrating against police brutality and racism since May.
It’s essentially the same trick: Taking a group of people who are both peaceful and in fact genuinely opposed to violence  — refugees who are fleeing violence, protesters who object to police brutality — and portraying them as a threat to life and limb (and most importantly, to property) of “real” Americans, defined as people who are sure Jesus was white.
Naturally, Fox News and other Republican camp followers are echoing the message in maximally hyperbolic terms, with Fox prime-time host Laura Ingraham declaring that if Joe Biden defeats Trump in November, “You will become the target for criminals, for radicals, and the cancel culture” who will destroy “our families, our kids, our churches, our schools, our whole way of life.”
To bolster this message, Trump is sending federal police, outfitted to look like invading troops, into American cities to arrest people without cause, tear-gas groups of protesters and beat people, all to generate images of violence and chaos he can use to scare what he imagines to be a “silent majority”  of scared white people cowering in their suburban homes. With his usual lack of subtlety, Trump even tweeted Thursday that the “Suburban Housewives of America” should believe that “Biden will destroy your neighborhood.” (He appears unaware that most women with children under 18 at home work outside the home.)
But there is no reason to believe this strategy will work for him. As I wrote on Thursday, all the polling so far suggests that voters accurately perceive that Trump’s crackdowns are the source of violence, not the protesters themselves. As Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times pointed out on Friday, there is “a silent majority in this country,” but it opposes Trump’s racism and fear-mongering.
Perhaps more importantly, however, that silent majority cares a lot about protecting access to health care. They cared in 2018, when those concerns secured massive wins for Democrats in the midterms. They cared in 2019, when Democrat Andy Beshear won the gubernatorial race in Kentucky — a state Trump won by 30 percentage points — in large part because the previous Republican governor, Matt Bevin, kept finding ways to take away people’s Medicaid.
While there hasn’t been much polling in recent months to gauge the highest-priority issues, it’s a safe bet that these health care-sensitive voters aren’t particularly pleased with the way that Trump and the Republicans have let the coronavirus wash over our country, infecting more than 4 million Americans and killing 144,000 as of Friday morning — with both infection rates and death rates sharply on the rise once again.
Moreover, largely because Trump and the Senate Republicans have mishandled this crisis so badly, more than 5 million Americans have lost their health insurance since the pandemic hit. Many of these people are, or should have been, eligible for Medicaid coverage, but the refusal to expand Medicaid in 14 states, combined with massive Trump-era cuts to education and outreach programs have kept many Americans off the rolls.
Trump’s surprise victory in 2016 left many progressives wondering if he was some kind of political genius, even as he seems to think it’s a brag-worthy event to pass a cognitive test used to determine if someone has debilitating dementia. But that election was a fluke in many ways, a true black swan event. Thanks to his pathological narcissism, Trump cannot imagine what it would like to worry about losing health care access, and also can’t believe that other people might not be as racist as he is. So he’s running a campaign strategy, if you can even call it that, reflecting the “concerns” of a pampered racist poisoned by Fox News, instead of the things American voters are actually worried about. So long as Democrats stay out of the Trumpian media morass and continue to advertise their superior policies on real issues people, they have nothing to fear from Trump’s “anarchists and looters” strategy.

David Nather, in Axios, reports that Republican governors in four Sun Belt states are now suffering from low approval of their handling of the crisis — whereas in California, another state that is being hit hard by the surge, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is still popular.
Citing polling data that Axios received from Survey Monkey, Nather notes that residents of Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas were asked whether or not they approved of the way in which their governors have handed the coronavirus crisis — and the Republican governors of those four states all fared badly, including Florida’s Ron DeSantis, Texas’ Greg Abbott, Arizona’s Doug Ducey and Georgia’s Brian Kemp. Disapproval ranged from 62% for Ducey and 58% for DeSantis to 55% for Kemp and Abbott.
“In all four states,” Nather explains, “there were sharp increases between May and July in how many people knew someone with the coronavirus. In Florida, for example, just 33% knew someone with the virus in (a) May 11-17 survey. By the July 13-19 (survey), that share had jumped to 55%. In Texas, the numbers for those weeks jumped from 32% to 62%.”
In contrast, Nather notes, Newsom “still has 60% support for his handling of the virus even though cases have exploded” in California. Jon Cohen, chief research officer for Survey Monkey, told Axios that Newsom fares especially well among Democratic voters. That 60% approval takes into account California voters in general — Democrats, Republicans or otherwise — but among Democrats or those who lean Democrat, Newsom enjoys 82% approval over his handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
One Republican governor who, according to Survey Monkey data given to Axios, enjoys more approval than disapproval over his handling of coronavirus is Ohio’s Mike DeWine. Although some far-right extremists have attacked the conservative governor over social distancing restrictions in the Buckeye State, Survey Money found that 68% of Ohio residents approve of the way DeWine has handled the crisis.
DeWine, it should be noted, is among the GOP governors who has received a lot of favorable coverage in the mainstream media over his response to COVID-19. While many pundits at MSNBC and CNN have been quite critical of DeSantis and Kemp, they have applauded DeWine, Maryland’s Larry Hogan and Massachusetts’ Charlie Baker as three examples of Republican governors who aggressively encouraged social distancing in their states.
“The political damage from the coronavirus won’t just be a factor in the presidential election,” Nather writes. “It’s going to affect the political standing — and the legacies — of the governors in the hardest-hit states too.”

In May, he criticized CBS News reporters Paula Reid and Weijia Jiang for not being more like the stay-at-home mom Donna Reed portrayed on her sitcom, “The Donna Reed Show,” from 1958-1966 — and in a tweet posted on Thursday, Trump warned the “suburban housewives of America” that former Vice President Joe Biden, if elected, will destroy their way of life. Conservative opinion writer Jennifer Rubin slams Trump’s tweet in her new Washington Post column, arguing that it was “condescending” and underscores his problems with female voters.
In his tweet, Trump told “suburban housewives” that if Biden defeats him in November, he “will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I will preserve it, and make it even better!” Rubin notes that the tweet has been “widely mocked” and shows that “neither he nor anyone on his campaign knows much about suburban women.”
The Suburban Housewives of America must read this article. Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American Dream. I will preserve it, and make it even better! https://t.co/1NzbR57Oe6
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2020
The conservative columnist stresses, “‘Housewife’ may have been a popular term in the 1950s — which, it seems, is approximately when Trump imagines America was at its greatest: pre-civil rights, pre-women’s rights, pre-globalization — but for decades, it has been a condescending term that denigrates women who choose not to leave the house for work. I’m old enough to remember when Republicans used to claim Democrats did not respect women who did not work outside the home.”
Rubin goes on to say that in addition to expressing a “condescending” view of stay-at-home moms, Trump’s tweet used “racist” language.
“Trump’s screeching tone comically attempts to scare women, imagining they are easily frightened and susceptible to crude political manipulation and racist dog whistles,” Rubin explains. “‘Destroy neighborhoods’ is code for bringing the ‘wrong people’ into the neighborhood.”
Moreover, Rubin adds, Trump is failing to address issues that suburban female voters care about.
“Nothing in Trump’s appeal remotely addresses what does alarm women: the unchecked spread of coronavirus, an economic collapse, Trump bullying them to send kids back to school during a pandemic, Trump-directed clashes between police and demonstrators, and Trump’s constant attempts to inflame racial animosity,” Rubin writes. “It is not former Vice President Joe Biden who inspires fear and dread; it is Trump who raises their blood pressure and creates havoc in their lives.”
Rubin notes that Trump posted his “suburban housewives” tweet on the same day as the release of a video in which Biden and former President Barack Obama have a conversation about the issues the U.S. is facing this election year. Seeing Trump’s tweet and the Biden/Obama video side by side, Rubin argues, gives suburban women a compelling argument for choosing Biden over Trump in November.
“White women, college-educated women, suburban women, non-college-educated women — really any cross section of women you come up with — like Trump less than their male counterparts,” Rubin writes. “As a whole, Trump’s support among women has cratered since 2016, especially but not exclusively among white, college-educated women….. Female voters are vastly more savvy than Trump’s campaign believes; look for the gender gap to be among the largest in presidential history.”

0,2020-07-24T17:34:27+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-cdc-has-fallen-so-far-new-guidelines-show-the-white-house-has-corrupted-the-top-us-health-agency/,The CDC ‘has fallen so far’: New guidelines show the White House has corrupted the top US health agency,"The once non-partisan, science-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released new, updated guidance on re-opening schools. The title: “The Importance of Reopening America’s Schools this Fall.”
It includes statements that very closely echo what President Donald Trump and White House aides have said about re-opening schools. For example:
Death rates among school-aged children are much lower than among adults.  At the same time, the harms attributed to closed schools on the social, emotional, and behavioral health, economic well-being, and academic achievement of children, in both the short- and long-term, are well-known and significant.
Earlier this month President Trump insisted the original CDC guidelines, released July 8, for re-opening schools were “too tough.” They included basic coronavirus prevention strategies like keeping students six feet apart. That recommendation does not exist in the CDC’s new guidance.
The science hasn’t changed. Social distancing is still an important component to slowing the spread of the coronavirus. So are masks. If anything, in recent weeks scientists have learned that children do contract the virus, and do die from it. Children, once thought less likely to spread the virus, it turns out, once they reach ten years of age – generally fifth graders – they spread coronavirus as much as adults.
What changed in the CDC’s new guidance is who wrote it.
“On Thursday the CDC released several new documents that emphasize the benefits of school, in line with Trump’s messaging. Some of the guidance was written by White House officials rather than experts at the CDC,” The Washington Post reports.
Just ten days ago Vice President Mike Pence declared, “We don’t want CDC guidance to be a reason why people don’t reopen their schools.”
Two days later, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany echoed those remarks:
The White House announced the CDC would be re-issuing new guidelines after Trump called them too “tough.” CDC Administrator Robert Redfield, whose own actions crippled the U.S. response to the virus, said his agency would not revise the guidelines.
Less than two weeks later, the CDC published the new guidelines, designed to force the re-opening of schools, penned in part by the Trump White House.
On Wednesday, after announcing the GOP convention in Florida would be scrapped because of the coronavirus, President Trump declared schools “have to open.”
Former acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Andy Slavitt, who has been warning about the poor handling of the pandemic since February, weighed in on the new CDC guidelines.

0,2020-07-24T17:18:28+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/this-is-child-abuse-ice-held-migrant-kids-as-young-as-age-1-at-hotels-before-deportation/,‘This is child abuse’: ICE held migrant kids as young as age 1 at hotels before deportation,"The Trump administration has used a private contractor with an already sketchy history to detain migrant children who came to the U.S. by themselves at several locations of a popular hotel chain before quickly deporting them under an inhumane Stephen Miller-led policy that’s currently being challenged in court, the Associated Press reports.
Roberto Lopez of the Texas Civil Rights Project told the AP that he saw several unmarked vans parked outside the Texas location of the Hampton Inn & Suites chain, with adults and children inside. “He walked through the hotel Friday, spotting a small child holding on to a gate in a doorway as an adult on the other side played with him,” the report said. “Lopez said he could hear the cries of at least one child in the hallway.”
Normally, children who come to the U.S. alone are sent to Health and Human Services (HHS) custody until they can be placed with a sponsor, usually a relative already here. But in using the novel coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to quickly deport these kids in violation of their rights, the administration appears to be bypassing this, reportedly using private contractor MVM Inc. to detain kids as young as 1 at several of Hampton Inn & Suites’ Arizona and Texas locations.
“Federal anti-trafficking laws and a two-decade-old court settlement that governs the treatment of migrant children require that most kids be sent to the shelters for eventual placement with family sponsors,” the AP report said. “Lawyers and advocates say housing unaccompanied migrant children in hotels exposes them to the risk of trauma as they’re detained in places not designed to hold them and cared for by contractors with unclear credentials.”
The report said that “[a]t least two 1-year-olds were held for three days. But some young children, including 3- to 5-year-olds, were detained for two weeks or longer. One 5-year-old was detained for 19 days in the McAllen hotel.” It’s unclear how some of the babies and other very young children arrived here, but there have been numerous reports that desperate parents forced to wait out their asylum cases in Mexico under another cruel administration policy have sent their kids alone back into the U.S..
The AP reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) wouldn’t comment if the contractors are “licensed child care professionals or have received FBI background checks,” which would only require a simple “yes” if they were. And, if reported contractor MVM Inc. sounds familiar to you, that’s because another blockbuster investigation from 2018 found the company had also held migrant children in an office building for days at a time. Without access to showers, kids had to clean themselves at the sink. At night, they slept on mats on the floor.
“MVM had a contract with ICE for ‘transportation services’ extended for $49 million on March 31, according to federal contracting data,” the AP reported. “The company declined to answer questions.” Meanwhile, Hampton Inn owner Hilton told the AP the hotels that were used to jail the kids “were franchises and it believed rooms were booked directly with those owners. Hilton wouldn’t say how many rooms had been used to detain children or how much the rooms cost.” Nor would this be the first time a hospitality chain has despicably played a role in deportation efforts.
Last month, CBS News reported that just 39 children of the 1,001 children who arrived to the southern border alone in May were allowed to remain in the U.S. to pursue their asylum claims. The rest were quickly kicked out under the Miller policy and sent back to whatever unimaginable danger they fled from in the first place. We do know that one child that the Trump administration wanted to deport fled here after witnessing a gang murder in Honduras. U.S. officials tried to send him back, but a Trump-appointed judge blocked that deportation as litigation around the policy continues.
But, other children are still getting sent back—and during that cruel and unjust process are being mistreated. “This is child abuse,” tweeted Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. National Center for Youth Law attorney Leecia Welch tells the AP: “They’ve created a shadow system in which there’s no accountability for expelling very young children. There really aren’t enough words to describe what a disgraceful example of sacrificing children this is to advance heartless immigration policies.”

0,2020-07-24T16:44:06+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-gops-dam-is-breaking-and-it-could-face-previously-unimaginable-losses/,The GOP’s dam is breaking — and it could face previously unimaginable losses,"There are a few odd but interesting things in Nate Cohn’s analysis of recent polls. For example, Joe Biden is now close to erasing the Republicans’ traditional advantage with white voters, but he’s underperforming with Black and Hispanic people compared to Hillary Clinton. While it’s been widely reported that Biden is winning with voters over 65, ordinarily the GOP’s strongest demographic, he actually hasn’t made any new ground with them since May. His recent gains are coming from improvement with younger voters.
This last point doesn’t surprise me and I predicted that young supporters of Bernie Sanders would get over their hurt feelings well before November. They are still more reluctant than older voters to give Biden positive favorable numbers, but that should also continue to improve. As for the over 65 crowd, it could be that Biden just maxed out. If I have a possible explanation for why Biden isn’t doing as well with minorities, it might be that polls show they simply aren’t as engaged or “paying attention” at the same rate as white people. As Election Day nears, everyone will be engaged, and it’s likely that undecided Black and Hispanic people will solidify behind the former vice-president.
What appears to be the most consequential change is Republicans’ dwindling advantage with white voters. As Cohn points out, this could lead to previously unimaginable losses for the GOP in congressional and Senate races. It could turn states like Texas, Kansas, and Alaska blue. But I also think it’s part of the reason we’re seeing a mood change on white supremacy in general. It helps explain why Confederate statues are coming down and Congress just passed a defense spending bill mandating that Confederate names are removed from military bases and ships. It helps explain why police unions are suddenly on the defensive against demands for reform. And, I think, it’s also behind a lot of folks feeling that they’re being “canceled.”
David Brooks is whining in the New York Times that people like Andrew Sullivan are suddenly unemployable, but this isn’t an example of the left suddenly becoming intolerant of diverse viewpoints. That’s like arguing that police chokeholds are being banned because the left suddenly discovered that they kill people. What actually happened is that public opinion finally tipped in the left’s direction, and a practice that was formerly tolerated because white people supported it is no longer tolerated because they changed their mind. The same can be said for publishing people who argue for the inherent superiority of whites. The same can be said for naming your sports team the “Redskins” or having a racist mascot like the Cleveland Indians’ Chief Wahoo.
These things were “normal” and accepted only so long as whites accepted them in large numbers. Trump’s excesses have jolted enough white people to not only lose him support, but to lose support for many of the structurally racist things that have gone unexamined outside of leftist circles.
The change can manifest in simple ways, like people losing jobs they previously would have kept after saying or doing racist things. But the overall impact is complex and hard to predict. What we’re seeing is a lot of people who were previously safe and comfortable now getting called out for holding certain beliefs. It’s not a surprise that they howl like a scalded cat when they suddenly get burned.
This change in public opinion is going to reshape the country. The base and sports name changes are a precursor for the political realignment that’s coming in the election. Once political power resides on the left, we’ll see more transformation, and a lot more howling.

0,2020-07-24T16:21:35+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/warning-republicans-are-plotting-to-raid-social-security/,Warning: Republicans are plotting to raid Social Security,"Donald Trump is obsessed with defunding Social Security. In the midst of a catastrophic pandemic, millions of Americans are facing eviction and hunger if Congress doesn’t act now to extend unemployment benefits. Essential workers are in desperate need of testing and protective equipment.
But Trump doesn’t care. He has threatened to veto any COVID aid package that doesn’t include a cut to the “payroll tax”—Social Security’s dedicated revenue. On Monday, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) announced that Congressional Republicans are on board with Trump’s plan to defund our earned benefits.
As a response to the economic crisis, with 40 million unemployed in just the last few months, cutting Social Security contributions (which are only paid by people who are employed) makes no sense. They are a poor economic stimulus. The money is paid out slowly over many months and fails to get cash into the pockets of those who need it most and will spend it immediately. Those shortcomings defeat the purpose of stimulus—creating needed economic activity. The only reason to support this policy over better targeted, more efficient measures is if your true goal is to undermine Social Security.
When reporters asked Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for his thoughts on the Republican proposal, his response was refreshingly honest. Grassley worried that it “might create political problems” because “Social Security people think we’re raiding the Social Security fund. And we are raiding it…”
Grassley should be commended for his candor. Also, for his political acumen. The American people want their Social Security contributions to be used for their dedicated purpose—paying Social Security’s earned benefits and the associated administrative costs. Working families do not want their contributions raided.
Americans overwhelmingly oppose cutting Social Security. Raiding its dedicated revenue is the first step to cutting those earned benefits. Republican activist Grover Norquist once famously stated that he wants to reduce government to the size where he can “drown it in the bathtub.” That’s exactly what Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans want to do to our Social Security system.
The Republican tactic to reduce government is to “starve the beast” with tax cuts. Thanks to that tactic, government revenue continues to be cut, most recently by a tax giveaway to the wealthy right before the 2018 election. The starvation diet has caused Congress to cut domestic spending to the bone. Now, Republicans want to employ the same scheme against another “beast,” Social Security. “Starving” Social Security of its dedicated revenue, they hope, will force cuts.
Grassley went on to say “…but we have always put in general fund revenue in it so it is made whole.” On this point, Grassley is singing from the Republican hymnal. In reality, substituting general revenue for dedicated revenue will not make Social Security whole.
Indeed, substituting general revenue for Social Security’s dedicated funning is what Republicans have proposed starting all the way back to the presidential campaign of 1936, just a year after Social Security was enacted. General revenue is in no way equivalent to Social Security’s dedicated funding.
Unlike the general fund, Social Security cannot run a deficit. If it does not have sufficient revenue to cover every penny of costs, full and timely benefits will stop. It cannot borrow the needed money, because it has no borrowing authority. Consequently, Social Security does not add a penny to the deficit. Indeed, according to the latest Trustees Report, Social Security has a $2.9 trillion reserve.
Trump and his allies know that they cannot succeed by attacking Social Security directly. It is too popular. Instead, they profess their support for Social Security, all while undermining the program’s funding so they can demand cuts down the road.
For years, Republicans have tried to claim that Social Security is in crisis, going bankrupt, and that they are simply trying to “save” it. They also claim that Social Security is a driver of the deficit and so must be cut. This is oxymoronic, because Social Security cannot be both. If it is a driver of the deficit, it cannot be in crisis, any more than the Defense Department is. If it is in crisis, it cannot add to the deficit.
Unfortunately for the Republicans, Social Security is neither in crisis nor a driver of the deficit. Republicans are desperate to change those facts so that they line up with their anti-Social Security rhetoric. That is the apparent thinking behind the obsession with cutting Social Security’s dedicated revenue.
If Republicans simply cut Social Security’s dedicated funding, they will cause a crisis. If they substitute general revenue, they will, like the criminal who murders his parents and asks the court for leniency because he is an orphan, claim that Social Security adds to the deficit.
President Franklin Roosevelt carefully designed Social Security as an earned benefit. He astutely recognized that contributions by workers “give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect” Social Security. He predicted that those Social Security contributions, dedicated and able to be used only for payment of benefits and associated costs meant that “no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.”
We must organize to ensure that today’s “damn politicians” do not succeed in their attacks on Social Security. In addition to worrying that the Republican proposal would cause political problems, Grassley also recognized that, “it creates a public relations problem.” That’s an understatement.
If 2020 payroll contributions to Social Security and Medicare are cut, Grassley will save $11,341.70. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, will together save $22,934.25.
Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), who wants to cut Social Security behind closed doors, will benefit to the tune of $11,057.40, as would Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and every other Senate Republican.
Though the salaries of Donald Trump, Jr. and his brother Eric are not publicly reported, they will likely save hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, if their father gets his way.
In stark contrast, the 30 million workers who are unemployed will get $0. One-quarter of state and local employees—including forty percent of public school teachers and over two-thirds of firefighters, police officers, and other first responders, not covered by Social Security, will save around $700 in Medicare contributions.
That self-dealing on the part of our elected officials and their families is on top of self-dealing from the Payroll Protection Program. That program was designed to help struggling small businesses and their employees survive the economic collapse. It is just starting to come out who was first at the trough: Almost $14 million of that assistance went directly—and apparently quickly—to members of Congress and their families.
It is bad enough that Donald Trump and his Republican cronies in Congress are seeking to destroy our Social Security. It is insult on top of injury that they profit so royally as they do so.
In November, when we decide whether Donald Trump will retain the presidency and whether Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Graham, Ernst, Collins, Cory Gardner (R-CO), David Perdue (R-GA), Steve Daines (R-MT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), John Cornyn (R-TX), and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) retain their Senate seats, we should remember the money they are pocketing.
Donald Trump was right to say we should drain the swamp. What he failed to tell us is that he and his Republican allies are the swamp creatures.
Nancy J. Altman is president of Social Security Works and chair of the Strengthen Social Security coalition. She has a 40-year background in the areas of Social Security and private pensions. Her latest book is The Truth About Social Security. She is also the author of The Battle for Social Security and co-author of Social Security Works!

0,2020-07-24T15:53:25+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-magical-thinking-has-been-getting-one-reality-check-after-another-conservative/,Trump’s ‘magical thinking’ has been getting one reality check after another: conservative,"After months of insisting that the Republican Party would hold a massive convention despite the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump delivered a bombshell announcement during his Thursday, July 23 White House press briefing: the Jacksonville event has been canceled. The president, Never Trump conservative Amanda Carpenter stresses in a July 24 article for The Bulwark, got a reality check. According to Carpenter (former communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and now a CNN contributor), reality is something Trump has often tried to ignore during the coronavirus pandemic — but reality is still there whether he likes it or not.
“President Trump is making history again — not the kind of monumental, glorified achievements he envisions, though,” Carpenter writes. “This time, he’s become the first president in modern history to foul up not one, but two, of his own conventions. In the same summer. That’s gotta be a record.”
The two GOP conventions that Carpenter is referring to are the one that was to be held in North Carolina and the one that was later planned for Jacksonville, Florida.
“You may also recall that in early June, Trump pulled the Republican convention out of North Carolina because the governor (Roy Cooper) would not guarantee that the event could be held at full capacity because of the need for social distancing in the midst of a pandemic,” Carpenter recalls. “Trump did not like this. Not one bit…. And you may finally recall that Trump then took his convention to Jacksonville.”
Both times, Carpenter stresses, Trump’s “magical thinking” got a reality check.
“I mean, really, who could have possibly known that packing thousands of people indoors — not just in an arena, but in restaurants, hotels and taxis — was never going to work?,” Carpenter says with biting sarcasm. “Our great president may understand the science behind the coronavirus better than anyone, but he’s not a fortune teller.”
Carpenter goes on to say that Trump has spent months being totally unrealistic during the pandemic. At a White House press briefing on March 24, for example, he predicted that the U.S. would “reopen” by Easter.
“The country was never going to ‘reopen’ by Easter any more than someone was going to host a massive political convention this summer,” Carpenter stresses. “But this is what Trump does. He and his enablers in the media used the ridiculous Easter miracle prediction as a cudgel to beat on people who were trying to take public health seriously and stop the spread of the virus — right up until the moment that reality positively forced them to concede that they were being fatuous.”
Carpenter recalls that in an April 6 tweet, Trump “mocked” former Vice President Joe Biden for wanting the 2020 Democratic National Convention to be held online — and now, he has come around to Biden’s way of thinking and realizes that the GOP’s convention will have to be an online event.
“When Trump and his people construct their alternate realities, it’s other people who always end up footing the bill,” Carpenter writes. “With the coronavirus, we’re closing in on 145,000 Americans who paid for Trump’s magical thinking with their lives. In regards to the two aborted conventions, thankfully, the price has been less steep: just the planning costs and debts incurred by local municipalities and businesses to hold events that everyone knew — or should have known — were never going to happen.”

0,2020-07-24T14:29:29+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/politico-reporter-lays-out-8-disturbing-reasons-why-election-day-2020-could-be-a-total-nightmare/,Politico reporter lays out 8 disturbing reasons why Election Day 2020 could be a total ‘nightmare’,"From the coronavirus pandemic to the George Floyd protests to double-digit unemployment, 2020 has been an incredibly tempestuous year — and all of those things could affect the outcome of what is sure to be a divisive, often ugly presidential election. Journalist Garrett M. Graff, in a listicle for Politico published on July 24, lays out eight things that could go wrong on Election Day 2020.
“Anxious Democrats are already fretting about nightmare scenarios in which Trump uses emergency powers to cancel the election, calls in the military to ‘oversee’ voting, or even refuses to vacate the White House,” Graff explains. “But conversations with more than a dozen campaign strategists, security officials and election administrators make clear that the most likely picture this fall is something less theatrical — and every bit as destabilizing. November 3, even if it proceeds as scheduled, is likely to bring bureaucratic snafus and foreseeable chaos unfolding on 100 different fronts at once.”
The problems that could plague Election Day 2020, according to Graff, range from “foreign attacks” to “dislocated voters” to “misinformation and disinformation.” Another is “an uncontrolled pandemic.”
“Americans have never voted at a moment when it felt so unsafe just to stand in a group,” Graff writes. “No vaccine for the novel coronavirus will be widely available by November, and the health environment could well be riskier than it is now, as the spread of COVID-19 widens and collides with the traditional flu season…. The virus strikes old people hardest, and most U.S. poll workers are elderly volunteers.”
Other things that could make Election Day 2020 so “chaotic,” Graff writes, range from “a whirlwind of new technology and new processes” to “a drought of funding, causing a flood of delays” to “a famine of voter protections.” The journalist also warns of “declining voter protections, increasing lawsuits and no watchdog.”
“America’s two political parties are now in open warfare over the basic question of who gets to vote and how their rights are supposed to be protected,” Graff notes. “Beyond the Supreme Court’s 2013 rollback of a key part of the Voting Rights Act, the careful legislation that had protected the right to vote since the civil rights movement, this fall also marks the first presidential election since 1980 for which the Republican National Committee will not be bound by a federal consent decree that prohibits its controversial ‘ballot security’ efforts to challenge voters’ credentials…. The Supreme Court’s certainly not going to step in to save voting rights; it sided against easing voting restrictions in four rulings in a row this term.”
#8 on Graff’s listicle is the “unpredictable volcano in the oval office” —that “volcano” being, of course, President Donald Trump.
Graff observes, “In recent months, the president has been tweeting wildly to undermine the very legitimacy of the vote-by-mail procedures being instituted across the country. The president’s campaign against mail-in ballots has been fierce, regular and vociferous; in one tweet, he even suggested, without evidence, that foreign countries would print ‘millions’ of mail-in ballots.”
All things considered, Graff emphasizes, there are many reasons to expect a lot of chaos in November.
“Democrats and Republicans alike are openly wondering now: what happens if Trump refuses to concede?,” Graff warns. “Taken together, experts are anticipating an election in which it’s harder to vote, harder to count the votes, less clear who’s won, and more unpredictable than any election Americans have lived through…. It’s a certainty that voters will complain about lost ballots and whether their votes were ever counted; they’ll hear stories about or endure long lines, unusable machines and literal health risks on Election Day. And even on the smoothest national election days, there are power outages, thunderstorms, fires and random mishaps that could be seized upon in bad faith or by the more conspiratorial to condemn the overall result as unfair or rigged.”

While these things may be partially true, there is a far more important, overriding factor: his inability to hold ongoing rallies.
His loss of continual exposure to the public has meant his supporters would separate enough to see reality for themselves. This is a phenomenon mental health experts have spoken about in The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: how his continual exposure through the presidency would make him uncontainable, and we issued a “Prescription for Survival” in March 2020, to highlight how his removal or, if not, at least removal of influence was necessary for our collective health.
Mental disease could be more contagious than other forms of infection since it does not require physical exposure but only emotional bonds.
There are many medically unjustifiable misconceptions we have about mental disease, but none is perhaps as consequential as the denial that it can be contagious. Indeed, its contagion could be more efficient than other forms of infection since it does not require physical exposure but only emotional bonds. We noted at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic that the more important pandemic to gain control over was “the mental health pandemic.”
Weakened hosts, an environment that facilitates transmission, and our lack of consideration even of the possibility—even among some psychiatrists wedded to an atomistic view of people—has made Americans more vulnerable. In addition, poor mental health contributes to denial, and therefore those who are the most affected are the least likely to admit that anything is wrong. Bioterrorism is frightening, but psychological warfare even more so, for it hijacks the very mind that is capable of protecting itself.
My focus as a preventive psychiatrist has been the ecology surrounding individuals. Contagion of mental symptoms is common in public hospital and prison settings, where there are high concentrations of untreated, severe mental disturbances. Severe symptoms can spread among family members, criminal co-conspirators, gangs, and other tight-knit groups. A colleague and collaborator at the World Health Organization, Dr. Gary Slutkin, has long advocated that we consider violence and other behavior an infectious disease whose spread we can interrupt. International terrorism and suicide are known to be contagious, for example. Effective prevention, therefore, requires population-level interventions and application of psychiatric principles to systems, institutions, and cultures. The last course I designed for students at Yale Law School was one of translating law into social policies that prevent violence and further societal health.
Three conditions are necessary for the spread of mental symptoms:
1 Severe pathology in an influential figure
The transmission of mental symptoms has been given different names: induced delusional disorder, shared psychosis, folie à deux, trois, quatre,…, or millions—depending on the number affected—or mass hysteria when affecting a whole population. All describe the same phenomenon, but none are satisfactory. The latest, induced delusional disorder, focuses on the most commonly transmitted symptom, delusions, but does not cover other possible symptoms, such as mood. Shared psychosis captures the syndrome-like severity, but is a misnomer because it often does not involve actual psychosis. Folie à deux, or “madness in two,” is perhaps the most preferred but a foreign phrase. Finally, “mass hysteria” describes well the frenzied quality that arises from the sharing of symptoms among crowds, but often does not actually involve symptoms of “hysteria”, or histrionics. The important feature is that mental symptoms are not confined to the person; they take hold and spread across interpersonal boundaries, just as they initially take over one portion, and then eventually the whole of the mind of an individual.
Severe psychopathology in an influential figure, therefore, transmits to others or a group, until the exposed persons or groups come to feel, think, and behave as if they had the same disorder as the primary person. Unlike normal social dynamics, where enthusiasm, common purpose, or even outrage can be “infectious” but individuals retain their uniqueness, the spread of pathology is especially efficient and deleterious, taking over the personalities of those involved.
Transmission happens more readily in vulnerable persons, but those who succumb are not necessarily of unsound mind to start. Delusions of persecution or general paranoia are the most common to transmit, but even bizarre beliefs, such as the primary person being of divine origin, are not rare. Exposure to actual delusions is unlike exposure to strategic lies or simple misinformation; they are more infectious because the primary person is genuinely convinced of them and the emotional pressures for others also to believe them is stronger. For example, when an influential figure holds the paranoid belief that a serious viral pandemic is a “hoax”, orchestrated by one’s enemies to bring down one’s presidency, it can be more emotionally persuasive than any reality and is difficult to correct.
2 Group members with high emotional investment
Another condition for the spread of mental disease is emotional investment. Folie à deux describes shared madness within a pair, but here we will focus on folie à groupe, or the spread of mental symptoms in a group. The group can be a household (folie à famille), a prison dormitory or cell-block, a religious or other highly emotionally-bonded group, a community, or a nation. Members may have high emotional investment in the primary person because of family relations, gang affiliation, cultic programming, or similar symptoms to start. Pathology in the primary individual facilitates transmission: a compulsive drive to “tweet”, a desire to deny reality coupled with propaganda, intolerance of uncertainty leading to pressures of conformity, and an insatiable need for adulation driving addiction-inducing, hypnotic rallies. These symptoms create the ideal conditions for additional transmission of symptoms.
As symptoms spread, cognitive distortions, delusions, and other manifestations take on an emotional power that are difficult to match with normal responses. Induced delusions function like primary delusions, wherein resistance is too great for evidence or truth to gain traction. Those who try to maintain their grounding in reality experience stress, anxiety, ostracism and exhaustion and may eventually submit. When it originates in disease, it is different from culture but is more aptly called a “cultural disorder.”
3 An environment that fosters contagion
Conditions of isolation, either physically or through filtered information, especially when they “immunize” against alternative viewpoints through phrases such as “fake news” or “the enemy of the people,” combined with constant, high levels of exposure to the symptomatic primary individual, is the formula for shared delusions. The environment, therefore, is very important.
Many have remarked on the cult-like quality of the leader-follower arrangement we see with the president and his supporters. The dynamic alarmed my colleagues in the mental health profession enough to write entire volumes. Existing arrangements of “viral” social media, profit-driven news programs that rely on ratings, and rallies that reinforce herd mentality and conformity, all contribute to the spread of symptoms.
How is the recognition of shared psychosis, or folie à groupe, helpful? We know from the scientific literature that, when contact with the inducing individual is removed, the shared symptoms usually subside just as dramatically as they have appeared. If removal is not possible, we know that reducing exposure can be helpful. We can prevent epidemics from occurring in the first place by screening for mental impairment before individuals take positions of influence. Further, we can take steps to protect ourselves in the future by promoting public mental health and education about mental disease, as well as reducing environmental “toxins” that include propaganda, brainwashing, and filtered information. Knowing that mental compromise can contribute to physical demise, and recognizing the distinct, characteristic patterns of disease, we can better avoid mistaking it for a normal choice or just another ideology that excites people.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont or someone else — James Carville was sounding quite pessimistic and feared that President Donald Trump had a good chance of being reelected. But Biden is now the presumptive nominee, and Carville is very bullish on his campaign. Appearing on MSNBC’s “The 11th Hour” on Thursday night, July 23, the veteran Democratic strategist not only predicted a landslide victory for Biden in November — he also stressed that the 2020 election underscores the dysfunction of the Republican Party in general.
The 75-year-old Carville told host Brian Williams, “The situation is deteriorating by the day…. The Republicans are attacking AOC (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) and (Rep.) Liz Cheney at the same time. It makes no sense….. I have never seen anything even remotely like this…. They’re seeing the whole thing collapsing around them.”
Williams noted that during the Summer of 1988, there were polls showing former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis defeating Vice President George H.W. Bush in that year’s presidential election — which Bush went on to win decisively in November 1988. And Williams asked Carville is he thought that any of Trump’s lines of attack against Biden might ultimately work — for example, claiming that Biden is anti-police. But Carville maintained that Trump has too many things working against him, including “cutting health care during a pandemic.”
Carville told Williams, “It’s not like Biden isn’t a known entity” and added that Republicans are “in a tough spot.” The Democratic strategist argued, “I think the Democrats are looking very strong in Alaska — in states they never thought about before….. There’s a real crisis coming in the Republican Party.”

0,2020-07-24T12:29:40+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/democrats-now-favored-to-retake-the-us-senate-cook-political-report/,Democrats now favored to retake the US Senate: Cook Political Report,"If November brings the type of major blue wave that Democratic strategists are hoping for, it would include not only former Vice President Joe Biden defeating President Donald Trump, but also, Democrats achieving a majority in the U.S. Senate, increasing their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and enjoying victories in an abundance of state races. And the Cook Political Report is saying that according to its analysis, Democrats are now favored to retake the U.S. Senate.
Cook’s Jessica Taylor reports, “With just over 100 days until Election Day, the political climate appears dire for Republicans across the board. President Trump is the decided underdog against former Vice President Joe Biden in our Electoral College ratings, and Democrats could end up expanding their House majority. That leaves the Senate as Republicans’ firewall — the final barrier to unified control for Democrats in 2021.”
But that “firewall,” Taylor reports, could disappear because “as of now, Democrats are a slight favorite to win the Senate majority.”
A Republican pollster, quoted anonymously, told Cook, “Something remarkable would have to happen for Republicans to still have control of the Senate after November. It’s grim. There’s just so many places where Democrats either have the upper hand or are competitive in states that six months ago, we wouldn’t have considered at risk.” And a GOP strategist was equally pessimistic, telling Cook, “If you’re an incumbent in a bad environment sitting at 44%, you should be pretty damn scared. The expanding map has made it really hard, and there’s just a lot of Democratic momentum right now.”
Taylor cited Iowa’s Joni Ernst and Arizona’s Martha McSally as some of the incumbent GOP senators who are vulnerable — McSally more so than Ernst. According to Cook’s analysis, the Arizona Senate race now falls into the “leans Democrat” category, while the race in Iowa is a “toss up.”

Maxwell has been charged with recruiting and grooming girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and other rich and powerful men to sexually abuse, and the anti-Trump conservative group’s new ad shows the president’s longstanding ties to each of them.
“It’s despicable to hear the president express sympathy for an accused child sex trafficker,” said Tara Setmayer, senior advisor to The Lincoln Project. “While the country continues to grieve unspeakable loss from the Trump administration’s failed COVID-19 response, the president wishes an alleged pedophile pimp well from the White House podium. Shameful.”

Lie, of course","Thousands of lives have been lost as the novel coronavirus continues to spread across the country, yet our government and its officials still refuse to acknowledge the severity of this pandemic. As of this report, data compiled by The New York Times has found that more than 4 million people in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID-19 and 143,700 have died. Among them have been some who once called the virus a “hoax,” the families of these individuals, and others who have experienced the loss of loved ones as a result of COVID-19. They are sharing their stories to shed light on the horrific reality of this pandemic and the importance of following health recommendations.
In an interview with Mother Jones, David Glosser, the uncle of xenophobic white supremacist Stephen Miller shared his mother’s story (Miller’s maternal grandmother), who he says died from COVID-19. Glosser not only shared that he was “angry” at Miller, but added that he blames the Trump administration in part for his mother’s death. “With the death of my mother, I’m angry and outraged at [Miller] directly and the administration he has devoted his energy to supporting,” he told Mother Jones.
In a Facebook post on July 4, Glosser said: “This morning my mother, Ruth Glosser, died of the late effects of COVID-19 like so many thousands of other people; both young and old. She survived the acute infection but was left with lung and neurological damage that destroyed her will to eat and her ability to breathe well enough to sustain arousal and consciousness. Over an 8-week period she gradually slipped away and died peacefully this morning.”
When asked for a comment from Miller, a White House spokesperson provided Mother Jones with the following statement: “This is categorically false, and a disgusting use of so-called journalism when the family deserves privacy to mourn the loss of a loved one. His grandmother did not pass away from COVID. She was diagnosed with COVID in March and passed away in July so that timeline does not add up at all. His grandmother died peacefully in her sleep from old age. I would hope that you would choose not to go down this road.”
After being informed that the death certificate Glosser shared with Mother Jones identified Ruth Glosser’s cause of death as “respiratory arrest” as a result of COVID-19, the spokesperson again denied allegations Ruth Glosser could have died from coronavirus. “Again, this is categorically false. She had a mile [sic] case of COVID-19 in March. She was never hospitalized and made a full and quick recovery.”
Glosser, a retired neuropsychologist, has repeatedly spoken up against Donald Trump and his administration’s lack of response towards handling the novel coronavirus. In addition to partially blaming the Trump administration for his mother’s death, he said Trump’s “initial response to the epidemic was denial, distraction, misinformation, propaganda and lies.”
This isn’t the first time Glosser has spoken against Miller publicly. In 2016, he wrote a letter criticizing Miller for his anti-immigrant agenda. He then wrote a piece for Politico in 2018 expressing his feelings of “increasing horror” towards his nephew’s policies. The piece, entitled “Stephen Miller is an Immigration Hypocrite. I Know Because I’m His Uncle,” shared Glosser’s opposing views and gave insight into Miller’s own family’s immigrant history. “I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, an educated man who is well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country. I shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers had the same policies Stephen so coolly espouses—the travel ban, the radical decrease in refugees, the separation of children from their parents, and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrants—been in effect when Wolf-Leib [Glosser] made his desperate bid for freedom.”
Sharing the story of his mother’s death, Glosser highlighted the work of immigrant health aid nurses and doctors who cared for her and others experiencing illness. “I wanted to make it clear the best I can that the message the Trump administration pumps out—that immigrants who come here spread death, destruction, disease, and murder—is wrong. We were those people not too long ago. That’s the story of America.”
Responding to the White House’s statement, he said: “Keeping the tragic facts about COVID deaths of our countrymen and women, young and old, from the American public serves no purpose other than to obscure the need for a coherent national, scientifically based, public health response to save others from this disease. My mother led a long, satisfying, productive life of family and community service. She had nothing to be ashamed of, and concealing her cause of death to offer ‘privacy’ to me, our family, her hundreds of relatives and friends, does nothing to assuage our regret at her loss.”
Like many other victims of COVID-19, Ruth Glosser was unable to see her family before her death. She was living in an assisted living facility, which Glosser said was low on personal protective equipment and tests. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities nationwide have been hit hard by the virus. In addition to residents being elderly and potentially having underlying health concerns, a lack of supplies, insufficient health care, and inability in some of these facilities to properly social distance has led these places to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks. The administration has failed to adequately address this concern, with Miller being at the forefront of ignoring the severity of this virus and using it to advance an anti-immigration agenda.

0,2020-07-24T11:44:53+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/what-people-who-live-in-mostly-white-towns-need-to-know-about-history/,What people who live in mostly white towns need to know about history,"Last week, we hosted an online discussion many of you may have joined about the Black Lives Matter movements in small towns, and specifically in Anna, Illinois, a sundown town I’ve reported on. We talked with Jessica Moore and Takiyah Coleman, two organizers of the first Black Lives Matter protest in Anna, as well as James Loewen, a sociologist and author of the book “Sundown Towns.”
We received many more questions from our audience (of more than 500 people!) than we had time to answer, so I will be answering some more of them here. For a recording of the event conversation, check out the video on YouTube.
I’ve lightly edited a few of the questions for clarity.
Many of the landmarks in Anna and other towns focus on the architecture, history or events of white people. Do you see it as a priority to recognize that these were places of exclusion? How can [people] help to elevate places/stories of people of color?
— Frank
Yes, as I’ve reported in Anna, I’ve been aware of how the town, like many others, chooses to commemorate its history. As a sundown town, Anna’s history has been told by white people. In my first story about the town, I wrote about how the neighboring community of Jonesboro, which shares a border with Anna, was home to the third Lincoln-Douglas debate. There are plaques and statues at the location of this important event, but what’s striking is what that material does — and doesn’t — say. The signage commemorates the fact that the debate happened but not what was said and why. Many mainstream (white) newspapers of the time wrote about this debate as a loss for Lincoln, who had very little support in Anna and Jonesboro during his 1858 U.S. Senate campaign. However, one would not know this from reading the signage and markers about the debate.
Similarly, the Union County Historical Society and Museum has not exhibited any material based on the county’s history of exclusion, though museum officials told me they are aware of that history and sometimes get asked about it.
To your question: Yes. Many sundown towns have been afforded the privilege to tell their own stories about themselves, and this story is often told across the landscape, in addition to within local institutions such as museums and schools. Of note in Anna, though, are signs placed recently near the city limits in honor of a young Black man and former Anna-Jonesboro high school student who won the state’s 2018 wrestling championship in his weight class. However, the efforts of ordinary people to change how a place tells the story about itself matters. To elevate stories of people of color in mostly white places with histories of racial exclusion, I think it’s important for white people to follow the lead of people of color. Perhaps also talking with directors of local history museums and societies, as well as local librarians and educators, is a good place to start.
I grew up in Watseka, Illinois, in the 1960s-’70s, a rural town of similar size and demographics [to Anna]. Without exposure to African Americans living in our town, we adopted explicit racist attitudes from reading Chicago newspapers. While small towns should reflect on racist policies that have excluded and harmed African Americans, how can residents of small towns help to address structural racism that exists in both small and large communities with larger populations of African Americans?
— Kris
I do not know whether Watseka can be considered a sundown town, but from my perspective, questioning the reasons why any town or city looks the way it does is important. The vast majority of Watseka is white, according to the U.S. census. You can ask your parents, relatives, neighbors, etc. what drew them to the area. To your question about addressing structural racism in a small town such as Watseka, you could take note of who has power in the community: business owners, members of the City Council, county board, school board and police district, to start. Are they all white? What policies and practices have they adopted in relation to zoning, hiring and recruitment, housing and more?
Structural racism is kept intact in part because of a desire to keep outsiders — people of color — out. Individuals like you can begin to poke holes in the perceived value of living in a homogenous community.
I’m a reporter in New Hampshire thinking about whether to try to tell a story about the state’s racist history — a story that would puncture white myths about how welcoming New England is. But I’m worried that’s a story made for a white audience, in that it will be obvious to BIPOC that New Hampshire isn’t always welcoming. Should that stop me from pursuing the story? Is there a better framing I should use?
— Jason
No! It should absolutely not stop you from pursuing the story. I believe it should actually motivate you to pursue the story. The specificity of the audience when writing and reporting about sundown towns is important. Chances are, as you point out, people of color in your state already know about this but perhaps white people don’t. That is the challenge: to demystify and explicitly point out the highly racialized (white) environment many communities exist in, even if white individuals do not perceive race as a current or pressing issue. Keep going!
Some tips for anyone interested in researching sundown towns: Look through online collections of archived newspapers. Try the Library of Congress’ Chronicling America collection. Look through historic census data to see when and whether the community had a non-white population at one point in time, and then perhaps did not years later. Loewen has compiled some of that information on his sundown towns website (click on the map database). I’d also suggest contacting local historians, researchers and even genealogists who may be able and interested in helping you with research.
What can be done to help? Can state reps be pressured to address these towns? Are there businesses with corporate offices that can be contacted and forced to make changes?
— Mary
As Loewen pointed out during the event, only a few sundown towns in the country have formally acknowledged their pasts, including Goshen, Indiana, and La Crosse, Wisconsin. Every town is different, of course, which may require different paths. But citizens like you can make change. Here is one route Loewen suggests:
I think every sundown town in America needs to take three steps. First, they need to admit it: “Yes, we did this.” … Second of all: “We did this and it was wrong. And we’re sorry.” In other words, apologize. And third, “We don’t do it anymore.” And that needs some actual steps like, we are hiring black teachers. We are hiring black policemen, like garbage collectors, and we’re trying to house them in Anna-Jonesboro or in Kenilworth, or whatever sundown town we’re talking about. And once you’ve taken those three steps, then you are no longer a sundown town. Then, you’ve made some real progress.
Thank you again for showing up to the event. I hope we keep this conversation going. As always, if you have questions about sundown towns, please write to me at logan.jaffe@propublica.org.
Until next week,

As we did in 2018, we’d be working with UNITE-HERE, the hospitality industry union, only this time on the campaign to drive Donald Trump from office.
Now, however, we’re not so sure we ought to go. According to information prepared for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Nevada is among the states in the “red zone” when it comes to both confirmed cases of, and positive tests for, Covid-19. I’m 68. My partner’s five years older, with a history of pneumonia. We’re both active and fit (when I’m not tripping over curbs), but our ages make us more likely, if we catch the coronavirus, to get seriously ill or even die. That gives a person pause.
Then there’s the fact that Joe Biden seems to have a double-digit lead over Trump nationally and at least an eight-point lead in Nevada, according to the latest polls. If things looked closer, I would cheerfully take some serious risks to dislodge that man in the White House. But does it make sense to do so if Biden is already likely to win there? Or, to put it in coronavirus-speak, would our work be essential to dumping Trump?
Essential Work?
This minor personal conundrum got me thinking about how the pandemic has exposed certain deep and unexamined assumptions about the nature and value of work in the United States.
In the ethics classes I teach undergraduates at a college here in San Francisco, we often talk about work. Ethics is, after all, about how we ought to live our lives — and work, paid or unpaid, constitutes a big part of most of those lives. Inevitably, the conversation comes around to compensation: How much do people deserve for different kinds of work? Students tend to measure fair compensation on two scales. How many years of training and/or dollars of tuition did a worker have to invest to become “qualified” for the job? And how important is that worker’s labor to the rest of society?
Even before the coronavirus hit, students would often settle on medical doctors as belonging at the top of either scale. Physicians’ work is the most important, they’d argue, because they keep us alive. “Hmm…” I’d say. “How many of you went to the doctor today?” Usually not a hand would be raised. “How many of you ate something today?” All hands would go up, as students looked around the room at one another. “Maybe,” I’d suggest, “a functioning society depends more on the farmworkers who plant and harvest food than on the doctors you normally might see for a checkup once a year. Not to mention the people who process and pack what we eat.”
I’d also point out that the workers who pick or process our food are not really unskilled. Their work, like a surgeon’s, depends on deft, quick hand movements, honed through years of practice.
Sometimes, in these discussions, I’d propose a different metric for compensation: maybe we should reserve the highest pay for people whose jobs are both essential and dangerous. Before the pandemic, that category would not have included many healthcare workers and certainly not most doctors. Even then, however, it would have encompassed farmworkers and people laboring in meat processing plants. As we’ve seen, in these months it is precisely such people — often immigrants, documented or otherwise — who have also borne some of the worst risks of virus exposure at work.
By the end of April, when it was already clear that meatpacking plants were major sites of Covid-19 infection, the president invoked the Defense Production Act to keep them open anyway. This not only meant that workers afraid to enter them could not file for unemployment payments, but that even if the owners of such dangerous workplaces wanted to shut them down, they were forbidden to do so. By mid-June, more than 24,000 meatpackers had tested positive for the virus. And just how much do these essential and deeply endangered workers earn? According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about $28,450 a year — better than minimum wage, that is, but hardly living high on the hog (even when that’s what they’re handling).
You might think that farmworkers would be more protected from the virus than meatpackers, perhaps because they work outdoors. But as the New York Times has reported: “Fruit and vegetable pickers toil close to each other in fields, ride buses shoulder-to-shoulder, and sleep in cramped apartments or trailers with other laborers or several generations of their families.”
Not surprisingly, then, the coronavirus has, as the Times report puts it, “ravaged” migrant farm worker communities in Florida and is starting to do the same across the country all the way to eastern Oregon. Those workers, who risk their lives through exposure not only to a pandemic but to more ordinary dangers like herbicides and pesticides so we can eat, make even less than meatpackers: on average, under $26,000 a year.
When the president uses the Defense Production Act to ensure that food workers remain in their jobs, it reveals just how important their labor truly is to the rest of us. Similarly, as shutdown orders have kept home those who can afford to stay in, or who have no choice because they no longer have jobs to go to, the pandemic has revealed the crucial nature of the labor of a large group of workers already at home (or in other people’s homes or eldercare facilities): those who care for children and those who look after older people and people with disabilities who need the assistance of health aides.
This work, historically done by women, has generally been unpaid when the worker is a family member and poorly paid when done by a professional. Childcare workers, for example, earn less than $24,000 a year on average; home healthcare aides, just over that amount.
Women’s Work
Speaking of women’s work, I suspect that the coronavirus and the attendant economic crisis are likely to affect women’s lives in ways that will last at least a generation, if not beyond.
Middle-class feminists of the 1970s came of age in a United States where it was expected that they would marry and spend their days caring for a house, a husband, and their children. Men were the makers. Women were the “homemakers.” Their work was considered — even by Marxist economists — “non-productive,” because it did not seem to contribute to the real economy, the place where myriad widgets are produced, transported, and sold. It was seldom recognized how essential this unpaid labor in the realm of social reproduction was to a functioning economy. Without it, paid workers would not have been fed, cared for, and emotionally repaired so that they could return to another day of widget-making. Future workers would not be socialized for a life of production or reproduction, as their gender dictated.
Today, with so many women in the paid workforce, much of this work of social reproduction has been outsourced by those who can afford it to nannies, day-care workers, healthcare aides, house cleaners, or the workers who measure and pack the ingredients for meal kits to be prepared by other working women when they get home.
We didn’t know it at the time, but the post-World War II period, when boomers like me grew up, was unique in U.S. history. For a brief quarter-century, even working-class families could aspire to an arrangement in which men went to work and women kept house. A combination of strong unions, a post-war economic boom, and a so-called breadwinner minimum wage kept salaries high enough to support families with only one adult in the paid labor force. Returning soldiers went to college and bought houses through the 1944 Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, also known as the G.I. Bill. New Deal programs like social security and unemployment insurance helped pad out home economies.
By the mid-1970s, however, this golden age for men, if not women, was fading. (Of course, for many African Americans and other marginalized groups, it had always only been an age of fool’s gold.) Real wages stagnated and began their long, steady decline. Today’s federal minimum wage, at $7.25 per hour, has remained unchanged since 2009 (something that can hardly be said about the wealth of the 1%). Far from supporting a family of four, in most parts of the country, it won’t even keep a single person afloat.
Elected president in 1980, Ronald Reagan announced in his first inaugural address, “Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.” He then set about dismantling President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty programs, attacking the unions that had been the underpinning for white working-class prosperity, and generally starving the beast of government. We’re still living with the legacies of that credo in, for example, the housing crisis he first touched off by deregulating savings and loan institutions and disempowering the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
It’s no accident that, just as real wages were falling, presidential administrations of both parties began touting the virtues of paid work for women — at least if those women had children and no husband. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (“welfare”) was another New Deal program, originally designed to provide cash assistance to widowed women raising kids on their own at a time when little paid employment was available to white women.
In the 1960s, groups like the National Welfare Rights Organization began advocating that similar benefits be extended to Black women raising children. (As a welfare rights advocate once asked me, “Why is it fine for a woman to look to a man to help her children, but not to The Man?”) Not surprisingly, it wasn’t until Black and Latina women began receiving the same entitlements as their white sisters that welfare became a “problem” in need of “reform.”
By the mid-1990s, the fact that some Black women were receiving money from the government while not doing paid labor for an employer had been successfully reframed as a national crisis. Under Democratic President Bill Clinton, Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Reconciliation Act of 1996, a bill that then was called “welfare reform.” After that, if women wanted help from The Man, they had to work for it – not by taking care of their own children, but by taking care of their children and holding down minimum-wage jobs.
Are the Kids All Right?
It’s more than a little ironic, then, that the granddaughters of feminists who argued that women should have a choice about whether or not to pursue a career came to confront an economy in which women, at least ones not from wealthy families, had little choice about working for pay.
The pandemic may change that, however — and not in a good way. One of the unfulfilled demands of liberal 1970s feminism was universal free childcare. An impossible dream, right? How could any country afford such a thing?
Wait a minute, though. What about Sweden? They have universal free childcare. That’s why a Swedish friend of mine, a human rights lawyer, and her American husband who had a rare tenure track university job in San Francisco, chose to take their two children back to Sweden. Raising children is so much easier there. In the early days of second-wave feminism, some big employers even built daycare centers for their employees with children. Those days, sadly, are long gone.
Now, in the Covid-19 moment, employers are beginning to recognize the non-pandemic benefits of having employees work at home. (Why not make workers provide their own office furniture? It’s a lot easier to justify if they’re working at home. And why pay rent on all that real estate when so many fewer people are in the office?) While companies will profit from reduced infrastructure costs and in some cases possibly even reduced pay for employees who relocate to cheaper areas, workers with children are going to face a dilemma. With no childcare available in the foreseeable future and school re-openings dicey propositions (no matter what the president threatens), someone is going to have to watch the kids. Someone — probably in the case of heterosexual couples, the person who is already earning less — is going to be under pressure to reduce or give up paid labor to do the age-old unpaid (but essential) work of raising the next generation. I wonder who that someone is going to be and, without those paychecks, I also wonder how much families are going to suffer economically in increasingly tough times.
Grateful to Have a Job?
Recently, in yet another Zoom meeting, a fellow university instructor (who’d just been interrupted to help a child find a crucial toy) was discussing the administration’s efforts to squeeze concessions out of faculty and staff. I was startled to hear her add, “Of course, I’m grateful they gave me the job.” This got me thinking about jobs and gratitude — and which direction thankfulness ought to flow. It seems to me that the pandemic and the epidemic of unemployment following in its wake have reinforced a common but false belief shared by many workers: the idea that we should be grateful to our employers for giving us jobs.
We’re so often told that corporations and the great men behind them are Job Creators. From the fountain of their beneficence flows the dignity of work and all the benefits a job confers. Indeed, as this fairy tale goes, businesses don’t primarily produce widgets or apps or even returns for shareholders. Their real product is jobs. Like many of capitalism’s lies, the idea that workers should thank their employers reverses the real story: without workers, there would be no apps, no widgets, no shareholder returns. It’s our effort, our skill, our diligence that gives work its dignity. It may be an old saying, but no less true for that: labor creates all wealth. Wealth does not create anything — neither widgets, nor jobs.
I’m grateful to the universe that I have work that allows me to talk with young people about their deepest values at a moment in their lives when they’re just figuring out what they value, but I am not grateful to my university employer for my underpaid, undervalued job. The gratitude should run in the other direction. Without faculty, staff, and students there would be no university. It’s our labor that creates wealth, in this case a (minor) wealth of knowledge.
As of July 16th, in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis, 32 million Americans are receiving some kind of unemployment benefit. That number doesn’t even reflect the people involuntarily working reduced hours, or those who haven’t been able to apply for benefits. One thing is easy enough to predict: employers will take advantage of people’s desperate need for money to demand ever more labor for ever less pay. Until an effective vaccine for the coronavirus becomes available, expect to see the emergence of a three-tier system of worker immiseration: low-paid essential workers who must leave home to do their jobs, putting themselves in significant danger in the process, while we all depend on them for sustenance; better paid people who toil at home, but whose employers will expect their hours of availability to expand to fill the waking day; and low-paid or unpaid domestic laborers, most of them women, who keep everyone else fed, clothed, and comforted.
Even when the pandemic finally ends, there’s a danger that some modified version of this new system of labor exploitation might prove too profitable for employers to abandon. On the other hand, hitting the national pause button, however painfully, could give the rest of us a chance to rethink a lot of things, including the place of work, paid and unpaid, in our lives.
So, will my partner and I head for Reno in a couple of weeks? Certainly, the job of ousting Donald Trump is essential. I’m just not sure that a couple of old white ladies are essential workers in the time of Covid-19.

0,2020-07-24T01:30:50+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-republicans-are-on-a-sinking-ship-and-theyre-tearing-each-other-apart/,The Republicans are on a sinking ship — and they’re tearing each other apart,"Even if November’s electoral tsunami is still just a rumor on the horizon, that big blue wave already is rocking Republican boats. We can sense something different in the distance, not only because the polls say so but because political journalism has departed from its banal narrative.
Instead of the repetitious dullness of “Democrats in disarray,” there is the freshly entertaining spectacle of “Republican civil war.”
Indeed, the Democratic Party appears exceptionally united, following a primary season that threatened to erupt in division over its own ethnic, gender, geographic and ideological diversity. Instead of the angry and sometimes ugly recriminations that marred the aftermath of the 2016 primaries, which contributed heavily to Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the Electoral College, the 2020 competition concluded with affirmations of common purpose. And unlike 2016, the followers of Bernie Sanders seem ready to fall in behind the nominee, as their candidate promptly and fervently urged them to do. Very few Sanders supporters are telling pollsters that they will vote for anyone except Joe Biden.
In this cycle, the Republican Party is tearing itself apart from within rather than marching in their normal obedient lockstep. The prospect of doom rarely unites any political constituency, particularly when that group is motivated by power rather than principle or patriotism. What was once the Grand Old Party is now merely Grifters on Parade — and as President Donald Trump’s approval ratings decline, GOP elected officials are looking for someone to blame. This time they’re aiming at each other.
Within the House Republican Conference, the ultra-right Trump cultists revolted this week, aiming to oust Rep. Liz Cheney, R-W.Y., the only woman in their leadership. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, among others, accused Cheney of insufficient loyalty to the president and demanded that she step down. Although Cheney actually votes more reliably with Trump than either Gaetz or Jordan, she had the temerity to suggest that Republicans follow the advice of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s chief epidemiologist, since the coronavirus pandemic is now raging out of control across the red states.
Using science to stem a disease that has taken nearly 150,000 lives in four months is now Republican heresy.
On the other side of the Capitol, Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., are furious with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other members of their caucus for considering another round of economic assistance for families, states and municipalities. Confronted with the bankruptcy of fiscal “conservatism,” the senators can’t agree on whether to pass a new COVID-19 relief bill. Evidently, Cruz and Paul would let families and cities starve, while Cotton — and perhaps Trump — fears the political consequences of that cruel and destructive attitude.
So unemployment benefits are due to expire at the end of July, leaving tens of millions of Americans in potential destitution because the Senate Republicans fumbled this responsibility.
If the election were held today, the Republicans would risk losing the White House, the Senate majority and even more House seats. The peril to their party expands every day, as this president continues to fail in dealing with the pandemic and the economic ruin it has wrought. As public confidence in Trump vanishes, his most devoted followers in the House and the Senate only become more obsequious. But the brighter Republican officials are starting to realize that this disastrous presidency may destroy their party, and that obsessive loyalty to Trump may become a suicide pact.
The strife now erupting among Republicans is a product of Trump’s incompetence and corruption, none of which disturbed his party until they noticed that their own hides might be in danger. For months and years, they have let him and his ruinous administration run wild, either too cowardly or too cynical to utter a word of dissent.
Now the waters are getting rough; the ship of state is starting to founder; and soon the rats will be leaping over the gunwales. Trump is perfectly cast as the mad and selfish commander of a sinking vessel.
If the fate of the nation weren’t at stake, this would be highly entertaining. Bring popcorn anyway.

0,2020-07-24T01:06:58+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/mitch-mcconnells-plan-to-suppress-the-vote/,Mitch McConnell’s plan to suppress the vote,"Progressives are accusing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump of pulling out all the stops to suppress the vote in November after new details of the Republican coronavirus stimulus plan revealed it does not propose a single dollar in election assistance funding.
A summary (pdf) of the Republican plan obtained by the New York Times Thursday doesn’t mention election funding directly, but it does note that the GOP relief package will propose “no additional money for state/local governments.”
The draft adds in a parenthetical, “Certainly expect to get some [funding] added in negotiations with the Dems.”
“It is outrageous that this proposal contains not one penny to help states conduct safe elections during a global pandemic,” Sean Eldridge, founder and president of Stand Up America, said in a statement. “Policymakers should be doing everything they can to ensure voters are not forced to risk their health to cast their ballot.”
“Instead,” Eldridge said, “it seems Mitch McConnell is doing everything he can to suppress the vote by putting voters in danger.”
Stand Up America and other voting rights groups are demanding that Congress approve $3.6 billion in election assistance funding—a fraction of the $21.3 billion the GOP plan proposes handing to the Pentagon on top of the agency’s likely $740.5 billion budget for fiscal year 2021.
The Republican plan, which is being crafted in McConnell’s office in partnership with the Trump White House, has not yet been finalized and the details could still change.
Voting rights advocates say the election assistance money is necessary to help states expand vote-by-mail and ensure that in-person polling places are adequately equipped and prepared to safely hold a general election amid a pandemic.
Failing to approve election funding, progressives warn, could drive down turnout in November by limiting voters’ ballot options in an environment where it is potentially dangerous to vote in person.
Trump’s repeated and baseless attacks on mail-in voting as well as his refusal to commit to accepting the results of the 2020 election have added urgency to progressive efforts to ensure a safe and fair contest. On Thursday, Stand Up America and Indivisible announced that 30 new advocacy groups have joined the grassroots campaign preparing to mobilize should Trump refuse to leave office.
“Together, we will ensure that every vote is counted and that we protect our democracy,” said Cristina Jimenez, executive director and co-founder of United We Dream Action, an immigrant rights group.
In May, House Democrats passed legislation that would provide more than $1 trillion in funding for state and local governments—including billions in election assistance money—as they face pandemic-induced budgetary crises.
Eldridge said Democratic lawmakers must do everything in their power to ensure that adequate election assistance funding is included in the stimulus package that eventually makes its way through Congress.
“Democrats in both chambers cannot allow Republicans to threaten the foundation of our democracy—and they must use every piece of available leverage to ensure election funding is included in a final brokered deal,” said Eldridge. “Nothing less than our democracy is at stake.”

0,2020-07-24T00:52:33+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/stephen-millers-uncle-is-furious-at-the-trump-administration-after-his-mother-died-of-covid-19/,Stephen Miller’s uncle is furious at the Trump administration after his mother died of COVID-19,"Thousands of lives have been lost as the novel coronavirus continues to spread across the country, yet our government and its officials still refuse to acknowledge the severity of this pandemic. As of this report, data compiled by The New York Times has found that more than 4 million people in the U.S. have tested positive for COVID-19 and 143,700 have died. Among them have been some who once called the virus a “hoax,” the families of these individuals, and others who have experienced the loss of loved ones as a result of COVID-19. They are sharing their stories to shed light on the horrific reality of this pandemic and the importance of following health recommendations.
In an interview with Mother Jones, David Glosser, the uncle of xenophobic white supremacist Stephen Miller shared his mother’s story (Miller’s maternal grandmother), who he says died from COVID-19. Glosser not only shared that he was “angry” at Miller, but added that he blames the Trump administration in part for his mother’s death. “With the death of my mother, I’m angry and outraged at [Miller] directly and the administration he has devoted his energy to supporting,” he told Mother Jones.
In a Facebook post on July 4, Glosser said: “This morning my mother, Ruth Glosser, died of the late effects of COVID-19 like so many thousands of other people; both young and old. She survived the acute infection but was left with lung and neurological damage that destroyed her will to eat and her ability to breathe well enough to sustain arousal and consciousness. Over an 8-week period she gradually slipped away and died peacefully this morning.”
When asked for a comment from Miller, a White House spokesperson provided Mother Jones with the following statement: “This is categorically false, and a disgusting use of so-called journalism when the family deserves privacy to mourn the loss of a loved one. His grandmother did not pass away from COVID. She was diagnosed with COVID in March and passed away in July so that timeline does not add up at all. His grandmother died peacefully in her sleep from old age. I would hope that you would choose not to go down this road.”
After being informed that the death certificate Glosser shared with Mother Jones identified Ruth Glosser’s cause of death as “respiratory arrest” as a result of COVID-19, the spokesperson again denied allegations Ruth Glosser could have died from coronavirus. “Again, this is categorically false. She had a mile [sic] case of COVID-19 in March. She was never hospitalized and made a full and quick recovery.”
Glosser, a retired neuropsychologist, has repeatedly spoken up against Donald Trump and his administration’s lack of response towards handling the novel coronavirus. In addition to partially blaming the Trump administration for his mother’s death, he said Trump’s “initial response to the epidemic was denial, distraction, misinformation, propaganda and lies.”
This isn’t the first time Glosser has spoken against Miller publicly. In 2016, he wrote a letter criticizing Miller for his anti-immigrant agenda. He then wrote a piece for Politico in 2018 expressing his feelings of “increasing horror” towards his nephew’s policies. The piece, entitled “Stephen Miller is an Immigration Hypocrite. I Know Because I’m His Uncle,” shared Glosser’s opposing views and gave insight into Miller’s own family’s immigrant history. “I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, an educated man who is well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country. I shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers had the same policies Stephen so coolly espouses—the travel ban, the radical decrease in refugees, the separation of children from their parents, and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrants—been in effect when Wolf-Leib [Glosser] made his desperate bid for freedom.”
Sharing the story of his mother’s death, Glosser highlighted the work of immigrant health aid nurses and doctors who cared for her and others experiencing illness. “I wanted to make it clear the best I can that the message the Trump administration pumps out—that immigrants who come here spread death, destruction, disease, and murder—is wrong. We were those people not too long ago. That’s the story of America.”
Responding to the White House’s statement, he said: “Keeping the tragic facts about COVID deaths of our countrymen and women, young and old, from the American public serves no purpose other than to obscure the need for a coherent national, scientifically based, public health response to save others from this disease. My mother led a long, satisfying, productive life of family and community service. She had nothing to be ashamed of, and concealing her cause of death to offer ‘privacy’ to me, our family, her hundreds of relatives and friends, does nothing to assuage our regret at her loss.”
Like many other victims of COVID-19, Ruth Glosser was unable to see her family before her death. She was living in an assisted living facility, which Glosser said was low on personal protective equipment and tests. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities nationwide have been hit hard by the virus. In addition to residents being elderly and potentially having underlying health concerns, a lack of supplies, insufficient health care, and inability in some of these facilities to properly social distance has led these places to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks. The administration has failed to adequately address this concern, with Miller being at the forefront of ignoring the severity of this virus and using it to advance an anti-immigration agenda.

0,2020-07-24T00:41:00+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/joe-are-the-russians-bad-here-are-5-revealing-details-from-new-records-of-trumps-intel-briefing/,"‘Joe, are the Russians bad?’: Here are 5 revealing details from new records of Trump’s intel briefing","A new document declassified by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence gives a new glimpse into Crossfire Hurricane, the investigation that was eventually taken over by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
It records the notes of an FBI briefer who discussed foreign intelligence threats with then-candidate Donald Trump, Chris Christie, and Michael Flynn in August of 2016. The nature of the briefing has previously drawn scrutiny. While it was largely conducted as a typical security briefing of a presidential candidate, it was also carried out by a briefer involved in the investigation of associates of Trump’s campaign — including Flynn. Though not illegal or against official rules, critics have objected that it was inappropriate for the FBI to use a security briefing for purposes that the candidate himself was not aware of.
DNI John Ratcliffe presumably declassified the document to further the aims of Trump’s allies who are seeking to discredit Crossfire Hurricane and the broader Russia investigation. It doesn’t really present much new ammunition on that front, though, since the basics of the briefing were already known.
But here are five revealing details that the records contain:
1. “Joe, are the Russians bad?”
When the briefer, Joe Pientka, informed Trump of the nature of the Chinese and Russian counterintelligence threats, the candidate responded with this seemingly naive question. He continued, referring to the fact that the Russians had comparatively more intelligence officers in the U.S.: “Because they have more numbers, are they worse than the Chinese?”
Pientka responded by saying they are both bad.
“The numbers of [intelligence officers] present in the U.S. is not an indicator of the severity of the threat,” he noted.
2. Trump was warned about what happening, despite his claims
In the midst of the Russia investigation during his presidency, Trump claimed that he was never warned by the FBI of the threat posed to his campaign and the election more broadly:
RUSH LIMBAUGH “If the FBI was so concerned, and if they weren’t targeting Trump, they should have told Trump. If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? Why not tell Trump? Because they were pushing this scam.”
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018
With Spies, or “Informants” as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or “Justice” contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2018
As the documents make clear, though, Trump was warned explicitly that the Russians would likely try to recruit his associates and potentially infiltrate his campaign:
In the classical sense, an [intelligence officer] will attempt to recruit an individual to tell him or her the things he or she wants to know. This is known as HUMINT. It is highly unlikely a Foreign Intelligence Service will attempt to recruit you, however, you need to be mindful of the people on your periphery: your staff, domestic help, business associates, friends, etc. Those individuals may present more vulnerabilities or be more susceptible to an approach. Those individuals will also be targeted for recruitment due to their access to you. That does not mean [intelligence officers] will not make a run at you. They will send their [intelligence officers] in diplomatic cover, businessperson NOCs, as well as sources they have developed around you to elicit information and gain assessment on you.
Given the voluminous contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russia, it’s likely this is exactly what happened.
It is true, though, that Trump was never specifically warned about the threats under consideration by the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.
3. Trump’s comments about Barron
In a moment revealing the shallowness of Trump’s understanding of cybersecurity, the candidate compared the threats from foreign intelligence to his youngest son:
Yes, I understand it’s a dark time. Nothing is safe on computers anymore. We used to lock things in a safe in a room. Now anyone can get in. My son is ten years old. He has a computer and we put a codeword on it. Within ten minutes he broke the codeword and we needed to put another one on the computer. Kids are genius.
4. Trump was given specific instructions about cybersecurity that he clearly never listened to.
Pientka told Trump:
You should be mindful of your use of landline telephones, cellular telephones, e-mail and computer networks. As you are aware, discussions regarding classified information should only be held in a facility certified for classified discussions. Therefore, a Foreign Intelligence Service would not necessarily target you technically to gain access to the classified information you were briefed on, but you will be targeted for sensitive and personal information about you.
…
[Pientka] followed up by stating, in addition, you should not only consider how you communicate but where you communicate sensitive or personal information. Foreign Intelligence Services will develop a pattern on where you hold private meetings or discussions. They will attempt to determine if the location is a meeting room, kitchen, bedroom, vehicle, etc. Once a pattern is established they will attempt to exploit that location technically.
Despite these specific instructions — and he has doubtless received similar and more elaborate guidance since then — Trump has repeatedly violated best practices for avoiding foreign surveillance.
5. “During the ODNI briefs, writer actively listened for topics or questions regarding the Russian Federation.”
The document was filed as a part of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, and Pientka noted that he was specifically conscious of mentions of Russia during the briefing. None of the comments from Trump’s side of the briefing seem particularly noteworthy with regard to the investigation.
However, as Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has argued, it was unwise to have someone involved in an investigation of individuals close to Trump conduct the candidate’s security briefing. This could prevent a conflict of interest, or at the very least, make candidates potentially suspicious of their briefers. For these reasons, Horowitz has recommended that the department specifically set guidelines restricting this sort of conduct.

0,2020-07-23T22:29:40+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trump-is-forced-into-a-humiliating-concession-on-the-gop-convention-after-throwing-a-fit/,Trump is forced into a humiliating concession on the GOP convention after throwing a fit,"On Thursday, President Donald Trump was finally forced to admit that the Republican National Convention he has been dreaming of simply can’t happen.
“I told my team it’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP convention,” he said. “We’ll be starting in North Carolina for the Monday, we were never taking that off, that’s remaining as it is. The delegates are going to get together, that’s where they do their nomination.”
He continued: “And we’re going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online the week that we’re discussing, which would be really good. I think we’re gonna do it well. And I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form. But we won’t do a big crowded convention, per se — it’s just not the time for that.”
It seems the president has finally come around to realize what many others have been screaming for months: There’s simply no way to responsibly hold a massive presidential nominating convention in person during a pandemic. Many key members of the president’s own party had already announced that they did not intend to attend the event because of risks.
But Trump was insistent. He repeatedly lambasted North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, who demanded that the convention would have to comply with the state’s coronavirus safety guidelines, which the president would not abide:
Trump lost the battle to impose his will on North Carolina, so he turned to Florida, which has a governor much more pliable to his whims. But many observers argued that the shift was unworkable. Not only would the pandemic make the situation dangerous, changing plans so late in the game was a logistical — and expensive — nightmare. Recent reports suggested that, to mitigate the spread of the virus in a region where cases are surging, parts of the convention would be held outside. In August. In Florida.
There was no way the convention was going to go smoothly as attendees fight off the virus, dehydration, and heatstroke all at once. When the Jacksonville mayor and sheriff came out this week to say that they were unable to provide security for the convention, it was just a matter of time before the president caved.
While these events have little impact on anyone who wasn’t planning on attending the convention, they’re indicative of the completely blinkered and haphazard approach the president had taken to the pandemic. He’s been driven entirely by his own misguided and egocentric instincts rather than any rational assessment of the circumstances. And he lashes out at those, like Cooper, who tell him hard truths. He’s the last person you should want in charge of an event like RNC — let alone the entire United States of America.

0,2020-07-23T21:01:52+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/this-is-how-we-deal-a-major-blow-to-trumpism/,This is how we deal a major blow to Trumpism,"When the Associated Press reported that former Governor John Kasich had been asked to endorse Biden in a speech at the Democratic Convention, a bit of a controversy broke out over whether that was a good idea. It then broadened into a discussion about the wisdom of welcoming the assistance of Never Trumpers in electing the former vice president.
Especially given the fact that the convention will be virtual, I don’t think it is all that important whether a Republican is given a platform to speak. But Charles Pearce made the case against doing so. He points out the policy differences between Kasich and the Democratic Party:
[H]is politics don’t belong within an area code of any Democratic convention. He’s radically anti-choice, radically anti-union, and a career-long adherent to the worst idea in American politics, the Balanced Budget Amendment. He opposed marriage equality; the Hodges in Obergefell v. Hodges was a Kasich appointee in Ohio. He’s a fan of private prisons, despite the customary problems.
Most of the critique of Never Trumpers, however, has focused on the Lincoln Project, a political action committee formed by George T. Conway III, Steve Schmidt, John Weaver and Rick Wilson. As I’ve pointed out before, they are hardly the only ones. Other groups of Republicans who have formed to defeat Trump include the Right Side PAC, 43 Alumni for Biden, and Republican Voters Against Trump. I suspect that the reason the Lincoln Project is being singled out is because the ads they have produced have gone viral on social media and the group has successfully lodged themselves in Trump’s head—which is actually one of their goals.
The criticism of the Lincoln Project has varied. It goes from a suggestion that the people involved are only in it for the money, to a claim that they are ineffective, to the fact that they have focused on negative ads, which are harmful to our politics. But perhaps the most important criticism to consider is the idea that the group will claim credit for electing Biden and then attempt to use that to influence his policies. That is the case made by Jeet Heer—specifically as it relates to militarism in foreign policy:
This suggests that these ads should be seen as an attempt to stake a claim in Joe Biden’s victory so that if he becomes president he’ll give hawkish Republicans a seat at the table. Biden already has a tropism toward bipartisanship, especially in foreign policy. He voted for the Iraq War and has been criticizing Trump from the right for not being sufficiently hard-line on Venezuela and China.
Heer’s assumptions about Biden are not born out by the fact that the former vice president’s “support” for the Iraq War was complicated and that in every case where the Obama administration considered military action, Biden was the voice against doing so.
The suggestion that the founders of the Lincoln Project will attempt to influence a Democratic president raises the question of what motivates the Never Trumpers and what their vision is for the future of the Republican Party. I suspect that varies from person to person. One thing to keep in mind about the Lincoln Project is that Trump isn’t the only target of their ire. I would remind you that they are the ones that produced this video:
What that ad suggests is that they aren’t just working to elect Joe Biden, they are attempting to ensure that he has a solid majority in the Senate—which is where the real battle will be over a Democratic agenda.
It is worth reading Greg Sargent’s summary of his conversation with John Weaver about the Lincoln Project. When it comes to their vision of the future of the Republican Party, this is the crux of the matter:
But will the Lincoln Project remain committed to concrete expansions of voting rights after Trump is gone? Weaver said yes, noting it will keep advocating for automatic voter registration and a restored Voting Rights Act, and continue fighting efforts to “make it difficult for black people or poor people to vote.”
“No more of that,” Weaver said.
But for the Lincoln Project, this is also a means of rescuing the GOP from itself. This will force it to “actually compete for votes,” Weaver told me, adding that the GOP will be a “better party for the country if everyone participates.”
If not, Weaver said, “it will die.”
If Weaver is to be trusted, that is a hint that he recognizes that the Republican Party’s embrace of anti-democratic strategies — designed to allow a minority party to stay in power — must be rejected. In order to take the next step, Weaver would have to articulate an actual agenda that didn’t rely on post-truth politics and instead, actually competes for votes in the arena of ideas.
No one in this group has been more clear about the need for that than Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant who has been affiliated with the Lincoln Project. Another Never Trumper, Max Boot, gives us some idea of what Stevens says in his book, It Was All a Lie: How the Republican Party Became Donald Trump:
He calls the GOP “a white grievance party,” and writes that “there is an ugly history of code words and dog whistles in the party.” The rest of the Republican platform he dismisses as a convenient fiction: “How do you abandon deeply held beliefs about character, personal responsibility, foreign policy, and the national debt in a matter of months? You don’t. The obvious answer is those beliefs weren’t deeply held.… [I]t had always been about power. The rest? The principles? The values? It was all a lie.”
As a reminder that, no matter what these Never Trumpers do in the future, there are deep policy differences that exist between their positions and those of the Democratic Party, Bill Kristol recently tweeted this:
Actually, the most meaningful way to address the Iranian threat is to reinstate the agreement negotiated by the Obama administration and our allies that stopped Iran’s development of nuclear weapons—which Biden has promised to do.
While Democrats should welcome a broad coalition to defeat both Donald Trump and his congressional enablers, there will be plenty of room for disagreement once that goal is accomplished. As Adam Gopnik wrote, right now there is a need to distinguish between honest opponents and toxic enemies:
What’s needed against Trump now is … not an ideologically narrow, politically focussed opposition but the widest possible coalition of people who genuinely value the tenets of democracy, meaning no more than the passionate desire to settle differences by debate and argument, rather than by power and cruelty and clan.
It is possible that Democrats could sway enough independents to beat Trump in November. But to ensure that things like voter suppression and foreign interference aren’t enough to question the results — and to deal a major blow to Trumpism — we’ll need that broad coalition to protect the tenets of our democracy. Once that is done, if Never Trumpers can actually present as “honest opponents,” then we can talk.

These federal officials have arrested and detained protesters over the objections from local leaders, stirring national outrage.
However, journalist Ken Klippenstein reports that according to a CBP document obtained by The Nation, its “support to local law enforcement” has “extended far beyond its controversial Portland deployment.”
The CBP document, Klippenstein reports in The Nation, is a “draft of the agency’s answers to questions posed to them by Sen. Kamala Harris on June 5, 2020” and “details the assets CBP deployed in response to requests for assistance from local law enforcement agencies across the country.” According to Klippenstein, CBP’s support to local law enforcement “includes not just thousands of personnel, but also, drones and dozens of other aircraft.”
“So many local law enforcement agencies requested support that, according to the document, CBP was not aware of any state or local entities that explicitly declined assistance,” Klippenstein explains. “The assistance includes a broad array of services like aerial surveillance, crowd control, unmarked vehicles and plain-clothes surveillance. Several requests involve specialized tactical units like CBP’s amphibious Riverine Force.”
The document, according to Klippenstein, shows requests from police departments in major U.S. cities that include New York, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Diego, and Washington, D.C.
“It is unclear when CBP intends to provide the information to Sen. Harris,” Klippenstein notes. “According to the document, between May 20 and June 10, these requests resulted in 326.4 hours of aviation assets deployments as well as 2174 personnel.”
The CBP document states, “The policies require the use of identifiable agency uniforms with badging and name tapes on the outermost garment: e.g., jacket, body armor.” And according to Klippenstein, CBP “appears hesitant to answer Sen. Harris’ questions” in parts of the document.
The Nation has published a copy of the document with Klippenstein’s article. One of Harris’ questions is: “Have your agencies deployed personnel or equipment to any jurisdictions that did not request assistance?” — to which CBP responds, “No. CBP has only deployed assets and resources as requested.”
Another question is: “Have any state or local entities requested that you not deploy personnel or equipment in response to the demonstrations?” And CBP responds, “Not that we are aware of, no.”

0,2020-07-23T20:18:26+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trump-sticks-his-foot-in-his-mouth-with-a-desperate-appeal-to-female-voters/,Trump sticks his foot in his mouth with a desperate appeal to female voters,"Almost nothing President Donald Trump ever does is subtle. When he tries to appeal to specific voting demographics, he often lacks the finesse to communicate the essential idea that he doesn’t just care about them for their votes — he actually shares their values.
That’s why he can easily espouse bigoted ideas even when trying to court specific groups of voters, such as when he told African-Americans that they are “living in hell in the inner cities” or when he told Jewish voters that supporting Democrats demonstrates “either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.”
So it was little surprise that, when Trump tried on Thursday to reach out to suburban women voters, he botched it:
Trump’s use of the word “housewives” was notable because the article he linked to didn’t actually use the word it all. It merely referred to “women” in the suburbs.
The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman noted the oddity of Trump’s phrasing:
The fact that Trump seems to immediately think of housewives when he hears “suburban women” speaks to his simplistic and stereotypical understanding of the electorate. As Vox’s Matt Yglesias pointed out, being a “housewife” — a woman who primarily cares for a family and doesn’t work outside of the home — is not the experience of even the majority of mothers:
There is, of course, a reason Trump and his defenders are focused on this demographic. Extensive polling shows that Trump’s support among women in the suburbs has cratered and created a massive vulnerability in the 2020 election for him. The Daily Beast recently reported:
President Donald Trump has been warned by his political advisers in recent weeks that his perilously low standing with suburban female voters could be worsening amid the lingering coronavirus crisis, imperiling his chances for re-election.
Five sources on the Trump campaign or in the administration told The Daily Beast that they fear the global pandemic and resulting U.S. economic downturn are potentially feeding frustration with the president among this demographic, which the campaign’s own polling sees as crucial in 2020. Two of the sources said the issue of suburban women has been raised in direct conversations with Trump in the past four weeks.
And CNN’s Harry Enten explained:
In the average of all the polls, Biden’s ahead by more than 15 points with suburban voters. This is a historic margin, if it holds.
The fact that Biden is doing so well in the suburbs shouldn’t be a surprise. The suburbs are a bellwether vote of sorts in our current political environment. That is, the suburban vote mirrors the national vote closer than the urban or rural vote.
Biden’s lead in the suburbs is reflective of him doing significantly better than Hillary Clinton. Four years ago at this time, Trump was beating Clinton by a 45% to 35% margin in the ABC/Washington Post poll among suburban voters.
In other words, we’re looking at nearly a 20-point improvement for Biden versus where Clinton was at this point in the 2016 campaign.
Winning this group back to Trump’s side, though, will probably take a lot more than hamfisted tweets urging them to read articles based on outdated stereotypes. He’ll need to show he can actually govern the country effectively and begin the work fighting the pandemic and recession that would actually improve the living standards for the majority of Americans.

In one moment from The Mooch’s event, Nielsen, who signed family separation into place, yet again lied and claimed there was no family separation policy. In a second moment, Nielsen claimed “it’s so past time” to give permanent status to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. But actions speak louder: Nielsen supported the decision to rescind DACA.
Maggie Haberman of The New York Times gave Nielsen some great unpaid PR help by tweeting this gem of a quote from that conference this week without any context:
Of course, the context being that Nielsen’s support for deporting DACA recipients was official. Like, as official as it gets:
Just in case there was any doubt left in the air, Nielsen’s DHS added some touches to let you know the distain was clear. “When a DREAM Act deal seemed possible,” tweeted immigration attorney Aaron Hall, “Nielsen’s Department of Homeland Security’s press shop started a concentrated campaign to sink it, including saying that the bi-partisan deal ‘ignores the lessons of 9/11.’ Not feeling this rehab tour.”
Neither are we, especially as her appearance in the conference made it clear she remains unrepentant about her cruelest act in office, as a main architect of the family separation policy:
Nielsen lied about the policy numerous times while in office, to legislators, to the press, and to us. In a timeline on the policy, reporter Jack Herrera wrote that in May 2018, “California Senator Kamala Harris grilled Nielsen in a Senate hearing,” where “Nielsen falsely denied that administration had a policy of separating children from their parents.”
He writes that the next month Nielsen again lied and falsely claimed during a White House press conference that “[t]his administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border.” She also tweeted the same lie from her official government account:
We wrote about that memo Soboroff is referencing here back in 2018. It exists. It’s there. She signed it, yet lied about it and is still lying about.
“We have the secretary of Homeland Security absolutely denying all of this, under oath, to Congress,” a frustrated Jeff Merkley of Oregon told CNN’s John Berman last year in calling on the FBI to open an investigation into perjury. “I am just sick and tired of this administration lying to the American people, lying to Congress, doing it under oath, and it’s time for real accountability.”
A count from late last year said that nearly 5,500 children were stolen by the Trump administration since 2017, 1,556 of those kids in the months before any policy was officially implemented the following spring. The administration is still trying to separate more families:
Nielsen doesn’t care about what she helped carry out, so she has nothing to move on from. But the children kidnapped under the policy haven’t moved on, and neither should we about what our government did to them, and is trying to do to them right now, in our name.

Liberal economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman discusses the bad economic news in a Twitter thread, lambasting Senate Republicans for wanting to cut unemployment benefits at a time when so many Americans are out of work.
“The unemployment claims number was terrible by any normal standard, although it’s kind of the new normal,” Krugman tweets. “It’s one of various indicators suggesting a stall in the economic recovery.”
In February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. had an unemployment rate of only 3.5%. But U.S. unemployment greatly increased as the coronavirus crisis accelerated and many brick-and-mortar businesses found themselves facing stay-at-home orders, social distancing restrictions, and a population \ terrified of the pandemic. U.S. unemployment, the BLS reported, reached 14.7% in April and decreased to 13.3% in May and 11.1% in June. But now, as the number of new coronavirus infections surges in many states, the Labor Department is reporting an increase in unemployment claims.
And according to Krugman, there is no way to sugarcoat the fact that the U.S. continues to cope with double-digit unemployment.
In his thread, Krugman explains, “We really don’t know whether the next official employment number, which will be for ‘July’ but actually a snapshot of the 2nd week, will be a small positive or negative. Politically that may matter; the reality is that either way, we’re stuck deep in a hole.”
In light of that “reality,” Krugman adds, the last thing Senate Republicans should be doing is slashing unemployment aid.
“It’s a really terrible time to be cutting off aid to 30 million unemployed Americans,” Krugman warns. “But that’s what Rs in the Senate are doing, apparently believing that restaurant workers etc. are living the good life on the dole and need to be forced back into their petri dishes.”

But according to liberal Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent, Trump’s effort to win back older voters by terrifying them isn’t working.
“Here’s President Trump’s new reelection strategy in a nutshell: convince vulnerable seniors who rightly fear getting killed by the pandemic that Trump let rampage out of control that they should instead fear getting killed by criminals who would supposedly rampage out of control in a future post-police dystopia that is entirely invented,” Sargent explains in a column this week.  “Trump just announced a plan to dispatch more federal law enforcement into Democratic cities without the assent of local officials — while offering numerous lurid exaggerations about urban crime and the supposed ‘radical movement’ to ‘dissolve’ police departments.”
Sargent goes on to describe how extreme and over-the-top of Trump’s recent anti-Biden ads have been. Trump, the columnist observes, “is running a new spot that depicts an elderly woman calling the police in terror as a marauder circles her house like a vulture, only to find that in ‘Joe Biden’s America,’ the police are no longer there. In recent weeks, Trump’s campaign has spent $20 million on the ad and others like it. But that ad is based on a lie: it falsely claims Biden would defund the police.”
The Post columnist continues,: “The fear of death hovers over that ad. It’s no accident that this comes as Trump is bleeding support among seniors, very likely due to his catastrophic mishandling of the virus, because they have the most to fear from it…. But here’s a funny thing: recent polling suggests Trump may be losing the argument over both coronavirus and law and order — even among elderly people.”
Sargent cites some recent polls showing what U.S. seniors are thinking about Trump —for example, a Washington Post/ABC News poll showing that seniors “trust Biden more on the coronavirus, 52% to 39%, and they trust Biden more on crime and safety, by 51% to 44%.” And a Yahoo News/YouGov poll, Sargent notes, “finds that seniors think Biden will do a better job than Trump on the coronavirus by 44% to 39%.”
“Trump is trying to frighten them even more with images of a fictional police-free future, but older Americans grant no presumption to Trump nonetheless,” Sargent writes. “Meanwhile, Biden is winning the debate over the coronavirus, the clear and present danger in the real world.”

As David Shipler wrote, we should all “beware of a cornered Trump” because “the closer defeat looms, the more deranged his administration will become.”
On a more rational level, however, none of this should surprise us. The benefit of 20/20 hindsight tells us that we knew all we needed to know about Donald Trump before he was elected (via the Electoral College). While not an exhaustive list, here are some examples.
Trump is a racist.
There was a lot of evidence pointing to this one. But suffice it to say that Trump launched himself onto the national political stage by claiming that this country’s first African American president wasn’t a citizen.
Trump is a serial sexual abuser.
Frankly, I’ve lost count of how many women accused Trump of sexual assault prior to the election. But in addition to his crude machinations on Howard Stern’s radio show, we all heard the tape of him bragging about being able to “grab p*ssy.” Nuff said.
Trump is a xenophobe.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by saying that Mexican immigrants are “drug dealers, criminals, and rapists.” During the campaign, he talked about instituting a Muslim ban on entry into the United States.
Trump welcomes foreign interference in U.S. elections.
Even after we all knew that Russia handed their hacked emails over the Wikileaks in order to make them public, Trump praised the organization over 141 times on the campaign trail.
Trump consistently abuses people who work for him. 
During the 2016 Republican primary, USA Today published a thorough report on the fact that over three decades, Trump was involved in over 4,095 lawsuits. Most of them involved his habit of stiffing contractors he hired to work on his properties.
Trump has no concept of justice.
Before the Central Park Five had ever stepped foot in a courtroom, Trump placed full-page ads calling for their execution in several newspapers. They were eventually exonerated, but during the 2016 campaign, Trump refused to acknowledge their innocence or apologize for his rush to condemn them with zero evidence.
Trump is an ignorant narcissist.
In July 2016, Jane Mayer published a mea culpa from Trump’s ghostwriter Tony Schwartz.
“Trump has been written about a thousand ways from Sunday, but this fundamental aspect of who he is doesn’t seem to be fully understood,” Schwartz told me. “It’s implicit in a lot of what people write, but it’s never explicit—or, at least, I haven’t seen it. And that is that it’s impossible to keep him focussed on any topic, other than his own self-aggrandizement, for more than a few minutes, and even then . . . ” Schwartz trailed off, shaking his head in amazement. He regards Trump’s inability to concentrate as alarming in a Presidential candidate. “If he had to be briefed on a crisis in the Situation Room, it’s impossible to imagine him paying attention over a long period of time,” he said…
But Schwartz believes that Trump’s short attention span has left him with “a stunning level of superficial knowledge and plain ignorance.” He said, “That’s why he so prefers TV as his first news source—information comes in easily digestible sound bites.” He added, “I seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.” During the eighteen months that he observed Trump, Schwartz said, he never saw a book on Trump’s desk, or elsewhere in his office, or in his apartment.
Trump is a bully.
Anyone who doesn’t demonstrate total loyalty to Trump is viewed as an enemy and attacked mercilessly. There were numerous examples of this on the campaign trail, but most prominent were his attacks on Senator John McCain, a Muslim Gold Star family, and a disabled reporter.
Trump is a serial liar.
During just one debate with Hillary Clinton, David Leonardt documented that Trump told 26 lies. Here is how Glenn Kessler summarized some of the biggest whoppers Trump told during the campaign.
Trump repeatedly made claims that boggled the imagination. He said the unemployment rate was 42 percent when it was actually 5 percent. He claimed there were 92 million “jobless Americans,” which included everyone who did not want to work, such as retirees and students. He even claimed that he could save $300 billion a year from a Medicare prescription drug program that only costs $78 billion.
Trump incites violence against protesters.
This video captures what Trump said at campaign rallies better than any verbal description.
I’m sure there are more things we learned about Trump during the 2016 campaign, but the point I want to make is that anyone who actually paid attention shouldn’t be shocked by what we are witnessing these days from the president. What is shocking is that 63 million Americans voted for him anyway.
It now looks like we’re stuck with Trump for another six months no matter what he does because our founders only gave us three options for how to get rid of a president.
Impeachment in the House followed by a trial in the Senate,
The 25th amendment, whereby a president can be removed from office by his Cabinet and Congress because he is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” and
An election every four years.
Because Trump’s enablers in Congress and the Cabinet have been unwilling to exercise their authority in the first and second option, it will be up to voters to do so in November. The one thing we should all take from this nightmare is to let it be a resounding affirmation of the fact that elections matter. And as Maya Angelou might say, “When a candidate tells you who they are the first time, believe them.”

0,2020-07-23T18:16:53+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/how-conservative-ideology-is-twisting-the-republicans-in-knots/,How conservative ideology is twisting the Republicans in knots,"With the 2020 elections only a little more than three months away, now is not the time to be giving the Republican Party advice, but I am willing to question their judgment in one respect. With 30-40 million Americans out of work, why are they obsessed with the idea that someone might get paid more to stay at home than to take a job?
Let me put it this way. If someone has a job to offer, that job is going to get filled in half a second. If the government wants people to work, they should create their own jobs. That’s what FDR did when unemployment was through the roof and the private sector was on its knees.
Instead, we get this, as reported by the Washington Post:
Republicans have continually argued that the enhanced benefits create a disincentive for people to return to work, because many can make more on unemployment. Mnuchin said Thursday that the GOP plan would include 70 percent wage replacement, which could reduce the $600-per-week payment to closer to $200 per week, although the precise details were unclear.
“We’re not going to continue in its current form because we’re not going to pay people more money to stay at home than work,” Mnuchin said on CNBC. “We want to make sure that the people out there who can’t find jobs do get a reasonable wage replacement — so it will be based on approximately 70 percent wage replacement.”
The issue here is the expiration at the end of July of a $600 federal enhancement of notoriously stingy state unemployment benefits. The Republicans wanted to scrap this payment completely, but now they’re coalescing around a reduced benefit closer to $200. People are going to notice that change and it’s not going to make them more likely to vote for a Republican.
It’s true that there are some people who have a little more money in their pockets right now than they would have had if there had never been a global pandemic. That said, a few stray rays of sunshine are better than unrelenting misfortune. If this is such in intolerable injustice, then why are the Republicans for sending out another round of stimulus checks? According to the Post:
In recent days, Trump had insisted that he might not sign an eventual bill if it did not include the payroll tax cut, but the plan was extremely unpopular with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNBC on Thursday morning that the White House still liked the idea and could pursue it in potential future legislation — although McConnell has repeatedly indicated that the legislation taking shape now will be Congress’s last major coronavirus relief bill.
“It won’t be in the base bill,” Mnuchin conceded.
He said the decision was made to instead focus on sending another round of stimulus checks to Americans, because that approach would put money in people’s pockets more quickly.
“Let me be clear: We think the payroll tax cut is a very good pro-growth policy, but the president’s focus is he wants to get money into people’s pockets now,” Mnuchin said.
The payroll tax cut was a moronic idea on every level, and especially because you need a job in order to see any benefit. Just writing everyone a check regardless of need is the bluntest of instruments, but it’s way more progressive and stimulative than cutting taxes. It also has the advantage that people will notice. This approach is better policy and it’s smarter politics. But it doesn’t do away with the problem of some folks having more money while they’re unemployed than they had when they were working.
This whole debate is a good example of the way ideology twists the Republican Party in knots. They wind up worried that they’re disincentivizing work when no one can find work. Then they settle on paying people for nothing because they prefer that to creating a government job.

0,2020-07-23T18:16:13+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/yale-philosopher-explains-why-trumps-performative-fascism-is-worrisome-enough/,Yale philosopher explains why Trump’s ‘performative fascism’ is ‘worrisome enough’,"Jason Stanley, author of the 2018 book, “How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them,” has done a fine job explaining what fascism is and isn’t and outlining its specific traits. During an interview with Business Insider, the author discussed President Donald Trump’s use of federal law enforcement against protesters in Portland, Oregon and his promise to do the same thing in other U.S. cities — and according to Stanley, the president is “performing fascism.”
“I’m not saying that Trump is a fascist,” Stanley told Business Insider. “Trump is certainly performing fascism — it’s performative fascism that we’re seeing. It’s the tropes of fascism, and I think that’s worrisome enough.”
During the interview, Stanley noted some of the characteristics of fascism — which include an “ultra-nationalism” and an “us/them” mentality. “Ultra-nationalism,” Stanley stressed, is crucial to fascism.
“There’s a famous story…. perhaps apocryphal, where a Spanish fascist was asked to speak at an international fascism conference in the early ‘30s,” Stanley explained. “And he said, ‘I’m not a fascist, I’m Spanish.’ Fascism, because it’s based on nationalism, is always going to take the most sort of crude and tense form of the nation’s traditional tropes.”
In the U.S., according to Stanley, fascism “would be wrapped in a Confederate flag. It would be wrapped in the vestiges of American ultra-nationalism, which is white nationalism.” And an emphasis on nationalism, Stanley stressed, is one of Trump’s characteristics.
According to Stanley the “us/them” mentality is asserting itself with Trump’s willingness to use his “militia” to “explicitly target Democratic cities” such as Portland and “create a sense that there’s lawlessness in Democratic-led cities and therefore, you need a strong leader to protect you.” But Stanley emphasized that a discussion of fascism shouldn’t focus on Trump specifically.
Stanley told Business Insider, “No, it’s not all about Trump…. What Trump is doing is: he’s pushing already existing fascist forces further. Does that mean that he himself is a fascist? It’s not really helpful to talk that way; it’s an emphasis on the wrong locus. What we need to do is remove the fascist forces. We need to address our prison system, address our over-policing problem, address our inequality, cut down the insider dealing between corporate elites and the government.”
The author went on to say, “My worry is less with Trump and more with the Republican Party that enables all kinds of behavior. My concern is with members of the Republican Party that care more about the Republican Party than they care about a multi-party democracy.”

0,2020-07-23T17:17:34+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trumps-war-on-cities-is-one-giant-photo-op-created-for-fox-news-and-campaign-ads/,Trump’s war on cities is one giant photo-op — created for Fox News and campaign ads,"On June 1, Donald Trump, the failed businessman who became president by pretending to be a successful businessman on reality TV, decided to tear-gas peaceful protesters in search of a photo op. With no apparent provocation, federal police assaulted a crowd of people staging a nonviolent protest in Lafayette Park, adjacent to the White House, unleashing tear gas on the crowd and laying into them with batons and rubber bullets. Soon it became clear why this was happening: Trump wanted his picture taken in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, and wanted a clear path to walk across the park.
But it was more than that: Trump also wanted images of people fleeing from paramilitary cops to air directly opposite the speech he gave just before his stroll, one in which the president claimed that “our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs or arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, antifa and others” and that he was “mobilizing all federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting.”
In other words, Trump and his aides apparently believed that chaotic images of cops crushing a peaceful protest would look, at least on TV, like proof of Trump’s characterization of the largely peaceful protests as “riots” being run by dangerous “anarchists.”
This gambit grossly backfired. Reporters on the scene saw with their own eyes that the protest had been peaceful, and the only people who could legitimately said to be “rioting” were the cops. Trump wanted to look tough but wound up looking weak and cowardly, a man so afraid of being heckled he hides behind a phalanx of RoboCops. Even the photo-op went sideways: Trump looked especially awkward with a Bible perched precipitously on his stubby fingers, in a manner suggesting he’d never seen or held a book before.
But Trump, never one to admit a mistake, has not given up on his belief that unleashing military-style assaults on peaceful protesters is just the thing needed to reinvigorate his campaign. He’s sent federal police — armed to the hilt and clad in camo, to maximize the appearance of being in invading army — into Portland, Oregon, to terrorize and assault people gathered peacefully in the streets. (Even the mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, got tear-gassed while doing nothing more sinister than standing in a peaceful crowd, chatting with protesters.) Now Trump has said he’ll send more federal goons to Chicago and Alburquerque, New Mexico, all against the express wishes of local and state leaders, who point out that  federal police, not protesters, are staging confrontations that become violent. He has suggested he may expand this domestic invasion to other cities across the country.
In a press conference on Wednesday, Trump tried to justify all this by claiming we’re witnessing “a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence.”
Like most things Trump says, this is an outright lie. FBI crime statistics show that overall crime is down by 5.3% since last year. It’s true that murder rates have ticked upward in many places from the historic lows of the last few years. Experts interviewed by the New York Times suggest that the protests have nothing to do with it, and that it’s a result of the enormous disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which has heightened stress, leading both to increased domestic violence and more heated disputes within the illegal drug trade.
As usual, Trump is lying about more than just the statistics. He’s also lying about his intentions. He isn’t doing any of this to keep people safe. If he cared one whit about the safety of Americans, he would focus his energy on fighting the coronavirus, not on staging violent confrontations with largely peaceful protesters. If he cared about reducing violence, he wouldn’t be causing more of it by sending cops to attack demonstrators. If he really cared about “law and order,” he wouldn’t be deliberately inducing chaos in the streets.
No, all this is about one thing and one thing only: The reality-TV president wants to create a spectacle for the cameras, one he thinks will get him re-elected.
That’s why Trump went to Tulsa to hold a rally near the site of one of worst racial pogroms in American history, on a weekend usually known for celebrating Black people’s emancipation from slavery: He hoped the provocation would lead to a violent clash between protesters and police. (It didn’t.)
Trump is playing the role of the world’s worst TV director, one who is using taxpayer money to inflict real pain and suffering on people who didn’t consent to play a part in his BDSM-themed cable drama aimed at viewers with a tear-gas kink. All for the purpose of generating B-roll footage of flash-bangs and clouds of gas and armored police and black-clad protesters to be featured in heavy rotation on Fox News and in campaign ads.
As Oregon Gov. Kate Brown explained on MSNBC, when Chad Wolf, the acting Homeland Security secretary, visited Portland recently, “he brought a Fox News team with him for a photo opportunity.” Unsurprisingly, that network is playing the role of Trump’s eager editor, presenting the Portland footage in misleading ways, and amplifying his lies about the protesters.
The one sticky problem for Trump’s artistic vision is that everyone outside the Fox News bubble can see that the protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful, and that the president who’s sending in poorly trained, amped-up federal cops is the one stoking violence and chaos. Trump is doing all this to get images of “violent” protests, but what he’s mostly getting is images of cops attacking a row of middle-aged women who are singing lullabies (that’s no exaggeration). As with the Lafayette Park incident back in early June, it’s obvious who the real instigator of violence is.
Trump’s campaign is so desperate for images of street violence that it literally borrowed a photo of protesters attacking a uniformed soldier — a photo taken in Ukraine in 2014 — and tried to pass it off as an image from recent American protests.
Trump’s gut-level certainty that (white) Americans yearn for more images of cops beating or attacking protesters is, like most things Trump feels sure about, entirely wrong. The most recent polling data from earlier this month shows that 62% of Americans believe that Trump’s handling of the protests has made the situation worse. When it comes to non-Republicans, that figure rises to 8 in 10 Americans. Trump is wasting taxpayer money and unleashing harm on U.S. citizens solely for the purpose of activating the worst impulses of the most racist and paranoid members of his base — people who were already going to vote for him, no matter.
Of course, Fox News — whose hysterical coverage no doubt inspired Trump to ramp up his autocratic crackdown in the first place — is backing him to the hilt, as are many of the Republicans running for election down-ballot from this historically unpopular president. That seems like a dumb move, likely to alienate any voters who weren’t already on board, but then again, what else do they have? With the coronavirus pandemic raging out of control and the economy in the toilet, Republicans certainly can’t claim they’ve done a competent job and deserve to keep on doing it. Violence and racism may not be a winning message in this year of historic turmoil and change, but at this point, it’s all Trump and his party have left.

You cannot hide it’,"A private warning about rising coronavirus cases made to leaders in 11 cities by White House official Dr. Deborah Birx on Wednesday is the latest sign that the Trump administration must end the secrecy surrounding its response to the pandemic, an investigative journalism group said Wednesday.
In an exclusive report about Birx’s Wednesday phone call to city officials, the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) revealed that Baltimore, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis have all been identified this week as cities where immediate, “aggressive” action is needed to mitigate their coronavirus outbreaks.
All the cities are seeing increases in coronavirus test positivity rates. Birx told officials that as soon as even a slight climb in positivity rates is detected, city leaders must begin mitigation efforts such as contact tracing, closing restaurants, and urging residents to wear masks.
“If you wait another three or four or even five days, you’ll start to see a dramatic increase in cases,” Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, said on the call.
According to Vanderbilt University researchers, Nashville’s positivity rate has already been going up for several weeks.
Public health experts identified Birx’s private call, which was closed to the press, as the latest evidence that the White House is keeping key information about the pandemic from the public—a trend that could continue to weaken the nation’s ability to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.
“This is a pandemic. You cannot hide it under the carpet,” Bill Hanage, a Harvard epidemiologist, told CPI. “The best way to deal with a crisis or a natural disaster is to be straight with people, to earn their trust, and to give the information they need to make decisions for themselves and their communities.”
The call came less than a week after CPI reported on a list of 18 states which the White House had privately identified as being in the pandemic “red zone,” meaning they each had more than 100 new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the last week.
Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, wondered why information about “red zone” states is not being disseminated to the public on a regular basis, allowing people to make choices about the amount of contact they have with others while cases are going up.
“The fact that it’s not public makes no sense to me,” Jha told CPI. “Why are we hiding this information from the American people?”
Neil Ralston, a journalism professor in St. Louis, also asked on Twitter why the White House would want to keep secret the need for aggressive action in his city.
Not sure why the White House wants to keep secret the idea that St. Louis and 10 other cities need to take aggressive action, but . . . https://t.co/I2tlQVcCKZ
— Neil Ralston (@journostuff) July 23, 2020
CPI reported that while hundreds of emergency managers and political leaders from the states and cities in question were on the call, Baltimore’s health department was not informed of the call. In order to get vital public health information promptly to the public, one epidemiologist told CPI, the White House must look beyond communicating with elected officials.
“It’s not just people who are holding office who need to make decisions,” Caitlin Rivers of Johns Hopkins University said. “The more that we can provide information to people to keep themselves and their families safe, the better off we’ll be.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14) took to the House floor on Wednesday morning to respond to the vulgar, sexist encounter she had with Rep. Ted Yoho (FL-03) and Rep. Roger Williams (TX-25) on Monday. Ocasio-Cortez was on her way to vote, walking up the steps of the U.S. Capitol when the pair of Republican congressmen angrily confronted her. According to AOC, Yoho was angrily wagging his finger in her face and as he walked away, a reporter from The Hill overheard him exclaim “Fucking bitch.”
The reporter’s account of the encounter sparked a firestorm and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and others demanded Yoho apologize for his remarks, which seemed to be in violation of the House Ethics rules. So the first order of business on Tuesday was Yoho issuing an apology on the House floor. Except it wasn’t an apology at all. He denied using the vulgar slur and then used the fact he has a wife and daughter to deflect from his poor behavior. While many media outlets nationwide ran with “Yoho apologizes” headlines, AOC rightly pointed out that he never apologized. He never said her name. He never took responsibility for his language. He apologized for “their misunderstanding”, claiming the reporter’s misunderstood his comment. And then he had the gall to say he would not apologize for “his passion” or for “loving his God.” Nobody asked him to apologize for his religion, they asked him to apologize for being a sexist, violent jerk. And while he didn’t raise his hand to strike her, a much larger man getting in your face, angrily yelling and wagging his finger in front of your face is very much a physical aggression.
With that, AOC stood on the floor to address the controversy in one of her most passionate speeches to-date. She said she intended to let the fury die down and she would move on, but then Yoho refused to take responsibility for his actions and it upset her he brought his own wife and daughter into the controversy, using them as a shield for his behavior. She noted that she is two years younger than Ted Yoho’s youngest daughter and that “she is someone’s daughter too.” She began to choke up a bit as she pondered how her own father, who is deceased, might react to seeing the hateful treatment she is frequently on the receiving of, from just using the subway, to working as a bartender and now in the United States House of Representatives. She said she could not let this go because “this is not new. It is something women face every single day. It is a cultural.
Enough of the recap, watch this deeply powerful speech. It will no doubt resonate with women worldwide.

To the female readers of this website, you know how this feels. There is not likely a woman alive who hasn’t been called a bitch or a fucking bitch, most likely starting before you even finished high school. (H/T The American Independent for the transcript)
REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): About two days ago, I was walking up the steps of the Capitol, when Rep. Yoho suddenly turned a corner — and he was accompanied by Rep. Roger Williams — and accosted me on the steps right here in front of our nation’s Capitol. I was minding my own business, walking up the steps, and Rep. Yoho put his finger in my face. He called me disgusting. He called me crazy. He called me out of my mind. And he called me dangerous. And then he took a few more steps, and after I had recognized his comments as rude, he walked away and said, “I’m rude? You’re calling me rude?”
I took a few steps ahead, and I walked inside and cast my vote because my constituents send me here each and every day to fight for them and to make sure that they are able to keep a roof over their head, that they’re able to feed their families, and that they’re able to carry their lives with dignity.
  I walked back out and there were reporters in the front of the Capitol, and in front of reporters, Rep. Yoho called me — and I quote — “a fucking bitch.”
  These were the words that Rep. Yoho levied against a congresswoman, a congresswoman that not only represents New York’s 14th Congressional District but every congresswoman and every woman in this country. Because all of us have had to deal with this in some form, some way, some shape, at some point in our lives. And I want to be clear that Rep. Yoho’s comments were not deeply hurtful or piercing to me. Because I have worked a working-class job. I have waited tables in restaurants. I have ridden the subway. I have walked the streets in New York City. And this kind of language is not new. I have encountered words uttered by Mr. Yoho and men uttering the same words as Mr. Yoho while I was being harassed in restaurants. I have tossed men out of bars that have used language like Mr. Yoho’s. And I have encountered this type of harassment riding the subway in New York City.
  This is not new. And that is the problem.
  Mr. Yoho was not alone. He was walking shoulder to shoulder with Rep. Roger Williams. And that’s when we start to see that this issue is not about one incident. It is cultural. It is a culture of lack of impunity, of accepting of violence and violent language against women, and an entire structure of power that supports that. Because not only have I been spoken to disrespectfully, particularly by members of the Republican Party and elected officials in the Republican Party — not just here but the president of the United States last year told me to go home, to another country, with the implication that I don’t even belong in America.
The governor of Florida, Gov. DeSantis, before I even was sworn in, called me a “whatever that is.”
  Dehumanizing language is not new. And what we are seeing is that incidents like these are happening in a pattern. This is a pattern of an attitude towards women and dehumanization of others. So while I was not deeply hurt or offended by little comments that are made, when I was reflecting on this, I honestly thought that I was just going to pack it up and go home. It’s just another day, right?
  But then yesterday, Rep. Yoho decided to come to the floor of the House of Representatives and make excuses for his behavior. And that I could not let go. I could not allow my nieces, I could not allow the little girls that I go home to, I could not allow victims of verbal abuse and worse to see that, to see that excuse, and to see our Congress accept it as legitimate and accept it as an apology, and to accept silence as a form of acceptance. I could not allow that to stand.
  Which is why I’m rising today to raise this point of personal privilege.
  And I do not need Rep. Yoho to apologize to me. Clearly, he does not want to. Clearly, when given the opportunity, he will not. And I will not stay up late at night waiting for an apology from a man who has no remorse over calling women and using abusive language towards women. But what I do have issue with is using women, our wives and daughters, as shields and excuses for poor behavior. Mr. Yoho mentioned that he has a wife and two daughters. I am two years younger than Mr. Yoho’s youngest daughter. I am someone’s daughter too. My father, thankfully, is not alive to see how Mr. Yoho treated his daughter. My mother got to see Mr. Yoho’s disrespect on the floor of this House towards me on television. And I am here because I have to show my parents that I am their daughter and that they did not raise me to accept abuse from men.
  Now, what I am here to say is that this harm that Mr. Yoho levied — tried to levy — against me was not just an incident directed at me, but when you do that to any woman, what Mr. Yoho did was give permission to other men to do that to his daughters. In using that language in front of the press, he gave permission to use that language against his wife, his daughters, women in his community, and I am here to stand up to say that is not acceptable.
  I do not care what your views are. It does not matter how much I disagree or how much it incenses me or how much I feel that people are dehumanizing others. I will not do that myself. I will not allow people to change and create hatred in our hearts. And so what I believe is that having a daughter does not make a man decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man. And when a decent man messes up, as we all are bound to do, he tries his best and does apologize. Not to save face, not to win a vote. He apologizes genuinely to repair and acknowledge the harm done. So that we can all move on.
  Lastly, what I want to express to Mr. Yoho is gratitude. I want to thank him for showing the world that you can be a powerful man and accost women. You can have daughters and accost women without remorse. You can be married and accost women. You can take photos and project an image to the world of being a family man and accost women without remorse and with a sense of impunity. It happens every day in this country. It happened here on the steps of our nation’s Capitol. It happens when individuals who hold the highest office in this land admit — admit — hurting women and using this language against all of us.
  But once again I thank my colleagues for joining us today.

John Cornyn leading their matchup 47-38, but it nonetheless contains plenty of good news for Democrats, who are hoping to win their first Senate race in the Lone Star state since 1988.
For starters, Quinnipiac’s survey has Joe Biden edging out Donald Trump 45-44, a slight uptick from last month’s poll when Trump led 44-43. That suggests that undecided voters in the Senate race, contrary to what you’d usually find in a red state like Texas, lean toward Democrats, a conclusion buttressed by the crosstabs: While self-identified Republicans support Trump 89-6 and Cornyn 88-5—almost identical shares—Democrats back Biden 94-3 but Hegar just 82-6. If she can consolidate Democratic voters who support Biden behind her banner as well, she can start to close that gap.
Hegar is also far less well-known than Cornyn, who was first elected to the Senate in 2002. Cornyn has a 41-24 favorability rating while Hegar’s stands at 24-19, meaning fully 56% of voters don’t yet have an opinion of her compared to a third for the incumbent. That gives her space to improve her standing as long as she can get her name out. That’s always a difficult task in America’s second-largest state, but Hegar says she raised $1 million in the week since she secured her party’s nomination—a huge surge compared to the $1.7 million she brought in during the second quarter of the year.
Cornyn’s relatively low name recognition for someone who’s been in office for two decades also stands out, but that, too, likely reflects Texas’ vast size and fast-growing population. One notable thing, though, is that Cornyn hasn’t crossed 50% in a single poll all cycle long. That’s a contrast to his last race in 2014, which he won in a blowout and regularly polled above 50. Cornyn has always tied himself very closely to Trump, so if Biden does indeed carry Texas—as a number of other polls have also suggested he might—that could spell doom for the GOP’s hopes of keeping this seat.

The lawsuit (pdf), which also names the city of Portland, was filed on behalf of Savannah Guest, Christopher Wise, Christopher Durkee, and Michael Martinez, four volunteer medics who say they were assaulted by the Trump administration’s federal agents and Portland police during Black Lives Matter demonstrations this month.
“It was terrifying,” said Guest, who on July 12 was thrown to the ground by federal agents dressed in combat fatigues as she attempted to assist an incapacitated bystander. “Every human being deserves help, but the federal agents showed no humanity or concern.”
Guest’s assault was captured on video:
Here is my video from Portland last night.. I had to yank my medic from the FEDS, after throwing her off the curb, he then proceeded to smack her & the ground with a batton, how is this okay?!#booptroopeugene #PDXprotests #pdx pic.twitter.com/0hJNgrrIx4

Martinez, a graduate student at Oregon Health and Science University who was arrested in Portland on June 13 while packing up a medical tent, said he agreed to join the legal action “because many people in this country, such as George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, will never have their day in court.”
“I feel it’s all the more important to use whatever resources and power I have to confront this abhorrent system, which allows people in America, primarily Black people, to be beaten and killed by police without consequence,” said Martinez.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon as massive protests continued in Portland, seeks a court order barring federal agents and city police from targeting and attacking medics in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments.
Jann Carson, interim executive director of the ACLU of Oregon, said in a statement that “volunteer medics should be celebrated, not attacked or arrested.”
“Our clients are volunteering day and night to provide aid to the injured and to create a safer environment for protesters and bystanders. These attacks are unconscionable as well as unconstitutional. This lawlessness must end.”

Kate Brown to Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler to Sen. Ron Wyden has lambasted President Donald Trump for the use of federal Department of Homeland Security officers against protesters in Portland. And Wheeler himself has become a victim of the very thing he has been speaking out against: the Portland mayor, according to the Associated Press, was teargassed by federal agents on Wednesday night, July 22, while standing near a courthouse during another night of protests.
AP reports that Wheeler “said it was the first time he had been teargassed” and “appeared slightly dazed as he put on a pair of goggles someone had handed to him, coughed and drank water.” According to AP, “It was not immediately clear if the agents knew Wheeler was in the crowd when they used the teargas.”
Speaking during the protests on July 22, the Democratic mayor told protesters, “I want to thank the thousands of you who have come out to oppose the Trump Administration’s occupation of this city. The reason this is important is it is not just happening in Portland…. We’re on the frontline here in Portland.”
Wheeler has maintained that it is up to local law enforcement, not the DHS, to police demonstrations in his city. However, some fellow Democrats in Portland have criticized him for allowing the Portland police to use excessive force against demonstrators during the George Floyd protests.
AP notes that some members of the Portland City Council have “accused Wheeler of not reining in local police, who have used teargas multiple times before federal agents arrived early this month, in response to nearly two months of nightly protests since the killing of George Floyd.”
Oregon Attorney General Ellen F. Rosenblum has filed a lawsuit against several federal agencies — including DHS, the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Protection Service  — and accused them of arresting nonviolent demonstrators in Portland without probably cause.

CNN reports that former “Fox & Friends First” host Heather Childers has been let go by the network after she was benched for coming to work while sick back in March.
Per CNN, Childers “dismayed fellow staffers when she came to work while visibly sick” and she has not been on the air since.
Although she was seen coughing while on air back in March, the former Fox host says that she twice tested negative for COVID-19 and never posed a threat to her colleagues.
Shortly after her suspension, Childers even made pleas to President Donald Trump to help her get her job back.
“I’d love to go back to work @realDonaldTrump, but the antibody tests only show positive if you have had the virus,” she wrote in one tweet. “I’ve had TWO negative COVID19 tests results & no symptoms. Can I go back to work?’”

But Politico reporter Adam Cancryn, in an article published on July 22, wonders if perhaps there will be enough progress on a COVID-19 vaccine for Trump to enjoy an “October surprise” that saves his reelection campaign and helps him win a second term.
The World Health Organization’s Mike Ryan has said that although “good progress” is being made, it will probably be early 2021 before COVID-19 vaccines start to become available. And Cancryn notes that “Trump’s bet that a proven-effective coronavirus vaccine will be the October surprise to catapult him into a second term is facing increasingly long odds.” However, the Politico journalist notes, “that doesn’t mean he won’t find just enough reason to declare victory anyway.”
Cancryn explains, “While the race to find an effective vaccine for COVID-19 has crucial implications for nations around the world, it also carries political ramifications in the United States — with Trump banking heavily on finding a vaccine to quell both the pandemic and mounting unhappiness over his handling of the coronavirus response. Buoyed by a series of encouraging early trial results, the (Trump) Administration is laying the groundwork for a high-profile rollout of initial coronavirus vaccines in as little as three months. It’s a best-case timetable that also tracks with the final weeks before the November 3 election.”
According to Cancryn, the Trump White House’s Operation Warped Speed “has poured billions of dollars into developing a vaccine in record time, funding several efforts in parallel and buying up doses of the experimental shots in a wager that one will ultimately pay off.”
Cancryn reports that “several top vaccine experts” told Politico it could “take well into 2021 to produce and distribute the hundreds of millions of shots needed to inoculate the entire country.” However, the reporter wonders if early clinical trials could give Trump “the opportunity to seize on them as a potential game-changer.”
“While the Trump Administration has insisted that it won’t cut corners on safety — a vow the vaccine developers have taken as well — it’s left the door open to short-circuiting the process before those trials are complete,” Cancryn reports. “The (Food and Drug Administration) guidelines indicate the Administration could issue emergency authorizations as soon as it’s convinced a vaccine is safe and effective, clearing it for distribution to the public.”
John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, is among the medical experts who is worried that a COVID-19 vaccine will be rushed rather than adequately tested.
Moore told Politico, “That’s the concern — not that Trump might boost his poll ratings by a couple percent, but that we could make a catastrophic mistake. Anything in October is going to be politicized, and the last thing this pandemic needs is more politicization.”
Barry Bloom, an infectious disease expert at Harvard University, told Politico, “There is clearly a political goal for the president to say, ‘I’ve delivered a vaccine.’ But we will not know in three months, or six months — by January — how long the antibodies last.”

Not the one that involved correctly identifying a group of animals that were the supporting cast of Dumbo, or even in being able to count backward. It’s entirely possible Trump was capable of these tasks, just as he says … although the insistence with which he makes these claims is concerning. With Trump, the more often and more forcefully he says anything, the greater the odds it’s an absolute lie.
But where Trump really failed the test wasn’t in being able to repeat five words in order, or distinguish mammals with trunks from those with humps. Trump has failed his test, because he can’t identify the purpose of the test. Again and again, Trump has indicated he thinks this was a test is meant to measure some positive aspect of his brainpower, when that is absolutely not the case. And in his repeated failures to correctly identify the purpose of the test, Trump displays a fundamental failure—one that may be related to why he was given the test in the first place.
Of course, the superstar moment from Trump’s Wednesday appearance was this …
It’s not just that Trump insists on demonstrating his ability to repeat the list “person, woman, man, camera, TV”; it’s that he explicitly describes this as one of the “difficult” questions from the end of the test. It would be interesting to know what other questions Trump found difficult. Was it drawing a cube? Being able to arrange the numbers on a clock?
The whole point of a cognitive impairment test is that there should be no difficult questions. Yes, the average person may have to think a bit In counting backward by seven or nine, but repeating five words in order is not a challenge. If it seems like one, then that’s already a concern. There is no upside to this test. It either shows nothing, or it shows an issue. It cannot be “aced” because it doesn’t measure skill. It measures loss.
As The Washington Post makes clear, just the fact that Trump has been administered this test—more than once, if he is to be believed—is extremely concerning. The test, “is normally administered only if someone is concerned that they or their loved ones may be experiencing dementia or other cognitive decline.”
The timing of Trump’s claims about taking the exam suggest a connection to his mysterious Saturday night visit to Walter Reed Hospital. it seems altogether likely that some symptoms occurred—a momentary loss of consciousness, a period of aphasia, something—which made White House officials concerned that Trump had suffered some serious event. He was likely given the test to determine any lasting effects of … whatever happened.
But even if Trump is really the Bob Ross of drawing hands on a clock, the way he talks about the test itself shows a fundamental impairment; and one that is not limited to this test. Trump cannot process information that does not square with his initial impression of any circumstance. Whether it’s how Kim Jong Un is a great guy or hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness against COVID-19, once Trump has an idea fixed in his mind he cannot change it. This seems to be the case even when acknowledging new information would benefit Trump. That’s an aspect of cognitive flexibility, an executive function that is not well tested by the type of exam Trump was given.
There are ways to test this function … but they not really necessary. The plodding inflexibility of Trump’s mind is on display every day, and perhaps nowhere more clearly than in the way he cannot stop bragging about this test. By now, surely many people have tried to explain to Trump that the mere fact that he was administered the test is not a good thing. He can’t see past the idea that he got “extra points” for getting his five words in order.
Now, someone please change the nuclear codes. Because “person, woman, man, camera, TV” is going to be too obvious.

The president has claimed since the beginning that the pandemic was “under control,” despite his failures to boost testing, contact tracing and mask wearing, and now more than 145,000 have died in the COVID-19 pandemic.
“President Trump is incapable of handling the multiple crises we face,” said Reed Galen, co-founder of The Lincoln Project. “Because of his failures, America, a country with 5 percent of the world’s population, has 25 percent of the world’s new coronavirus cases.”
“We need a president who is ready and able to lead America,” he added.

And now, the Trump loyalist (who is the sister of former Blackwater mercenary Erik Prince) is the target of a lawsuit alleging that she illegally funneled coronavirus relief funds from the economically disadvantage public schools they were intended for to affluent private schools.
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. by the NAACP along with a coalition of public schools and parents. Law & Crime reporter Jerry Lambe notes that the lawsuit “claims that DeVos illegally issued a rule reallocating $13.2 billion in congressionally approved Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act funds to benefit private schools rather than public schools under a disputed aid formula.”
The complaint against DeVos states, “Contrary to the Act’s plain language, the Guidance Document directed (districts) to apportion CARES Act funds for private schools based on the total number of private school students residing in the district, as opposed to the number of low-income private-school students.” And the plaintiffs allege that because of DeVos’ actions, hundreds of millions of dollars were diverted from public schools to private schools — which, they argue, “is as immoral as it is illegal.”
According to the lawsuit, “In a moment of crisis — when public school districts are called upon to educate their students in unprecedented circumstances, to protect their students and staff from disease, and to feed families who have been plunged into poverty, all with decimated state and local revenues — it is unconscionable for defendants to siphon away the CARES Act’s desperately needed funds for the benefit of more affluent private-school students.”
DeVos, however, has claimed that there is nothing in the CARES Act saying that funds have to be allocated to economically disadvantage students attending public schools. The secretary of education recently told reporters, “The CARES Act is a special, pandemic-related appropriation to benefit all American students, teachers and families impacted by coronavirus. There is nothing in the law Congress passed that would allow districts to discriminate against children and teachers based on private school attendance and employment.”

0,2020-07-23T13:01:54+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/birx-pushes-back-on-report-that-she-tailored-coronavirus-data-to-suit-politics-im-a-data-person/,Birx pushes back on report that she tailored coronavirus data to suit politics: ‘I’m a data person’,"White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx defended herself Wednesday as “a data person” following a recent New York Times report painting her as someone who had sometimes tailored her analysis of the pandemic to better suit the politics of administration officials.
Fox News host Brett Baier framed the question by citing a key line from The Times article, which read: “Inside the White House, Dr. Birx was the chief evangelist for the idea that the threat from the virus was fading.”
“Did you read that piece?” he asked. “And what did you make of it?”
“I’m a data person, so I went back to that very specific day,” Birx replied. “I report out data every single day, so I went back to that day and looked at my report.”
“It said we’re seeing improvements in New York and New Jersey, but we’re seeing increasing concerns — and we’re not at peak in Boston and Chicago,” she said. “We have new concerns in Houston, and we have new hotspots developing in Washington, D.C. and across the south.”
“So, to me, that’s a very balanced report,” Birx continued. “That’s what epidemiologists and data people do: They just put the data out there as it exists.”
“I was surprised by the piece, because most people will tell you that I err on the other side — that I am too forceful and too direct often about the data and what it’s showing,” she added. “And I’ve never actually been called an optimist in that way before.”
The Times article focused on the pivotal month of April, at which time the severe outbreaks in New York and New Jersey had declined as others emerged elsewhere. According to the report, many of the most important decisions during that period did not fall with the official White House task force headed by Vice President Mike Pence but rather a shadow group which met every weekday morning in White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’ office.
“One of their goals: to justify declaring victory in the fight against the virus,” Michael Shear wrote for The Times. “In that effort they frequently sought validation from Dr. Deborah L. Birx, a highly regarded infectious disease expert, who was the chief evangelist in the West Wing for the idea that infections had peaked and the virus was fading quickly.”
That group was reportedly dedicated to churning out evidence in support of the administration’s decision to reopen the economy. Birx was the only public health expert present. If she indeed conferred legitimacy on their decisions, she stood in stark contrast to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert.
“As the pandemic worsened, Dr. Fauci’s darker view of the circumstances was countered by the reassurances ostensibly offered by Dr. Birx’s data,” the report added.
Since April, a raft of reports have claimed that the White House selectively sidelined Fauci. In an apparent effort to discredit the publicly popular Fauci, the Trump administration last week sent various news outlets a dump of documents described as “opposition research.”
However, Birx’s Wednesday defense raised the possibility that Fauci might not be the administration’s only apparent option for a potential scapegoat. The report documenting Brix’s performance drew from administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
In a separate Fox News interview Wednesday with network medical expert Dr. Marc Siegel, the president appeared to come to Birx’s defense.
“Dr. Birx is a big advisor of yours that isn’t getting enough attention,” Siegel said.
“She is responsible for all the incredible work that has taken place on AIDS in Africa,” Trump replied. “Millions of people are alive right now because of her.”
“She’s an unbelievable woman. A woman of tremendous substance and style, frankly,” he continued. “She has an amazing style. She walks into a room with a scarf and can do 15 things with it.”
But Trump did not allude to her work on the pandemic. And Birx did not join Trump at Tuesday’s coronavirus press briefing, a brief tradition which ended shortly after he waxed poetic on camera about the remedial effects of ingesting disinfectants.
In that moment, the president had turned to Birx to inquire about the medical virtues of what he characterized as “the heat and the light.”
“Deborah, have you ever heard of the heat and the light?” Trump asked. “Relative to certain viruses, yes. But relative to this virus?”
“Not as a treatment,” she replied, shifting in her seat. “I mean, certainly fever — is a good thing when you have a fever. It helps your body respond. But not — as I have not seen heat or light.”
Neither Fauci nor Birx accompanied the president at the podium Wednesday, though Trump said he had spoken with Fauci. Birx was apparently in the hallway.
“I just spoke to Dr. Fauci,” said the president. “Dr. Birx is right outside, and they’re giving me all of everything they know as of this point in time. And I’m giving the information to you, and I think it’s probably a very concise way of doing it.”
“It seems to be working out very well,” he added.

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
This year, President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign filed defamation lawsuits against three of the country’s most prominent news outlets: The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. Then it filed another suit against a somewhat lower-profile news organization: northern Wisconsin’s WJFW-TV, which serves the 134th-largest market in the country.
The Trump campaign sued the station over what it claims is a false and defamatory ad WJFW aired that showed Trump downplaying the threat of the coronavirus as a line tracking new COVID-19 infections ticks up and up on the screen.
Dozens of stations ran the ad. But the Trump campaign chose to sue just NBC-affiliate WJFW, which is owned by a relatively small company that only has two other local TV stations, both in Bangor, Maine. The campaign did not initially sue the political organization that produced the ad. That group later joined the case as a defendant.
The curious lawsuit is part of a larger, aggressive and exceedingly expensive legal operation by the Trump campaign that’s the focus of our latest “Trump, Inc.” podcast.
The campaign has spent over $16 million on litigation and other legal costs — more than any past presidential campaign and more than 10 times what presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has spent on legal services, according to disclosures.
Trump has long boasted about his penchant for filing lawsuits. The president and his businesses have reportedly filed over 2,000 lawsuits. After losing a 2006 defamation lawsuit against the journalist Tim O’Brien, Trump told the Post that he knew he couldn’t win, but he sued anyway. “I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more,” Trump said. “I did it to make his life miserable, which I’m happy about.”
As with other areas, Trump has taken his approach to running his personal life and business to the presidency.
Multiple media law experts told us that the suit against tiny WJFW has little chance of succeeding. Susan Seager, a media defense lawyer and adjunct professor at The University of California, Irvine, School of Law, said, “The courts are very deferential and very protective of opinions about public figures and political issues.”
So if Trump isn’t likely to win, what might he be trying to do? Matthew Sanderson, who served as counsel for Sens. John McCain and Mitt Romney, said he thinks the Trump campaign is “engaging in scare tactics.”
“The reason in my opinion that the Trump campaign is filing these types of lawsuits is not necessarily to punish the Wisconsin station — they’re not going to be successful,” Sanderson said. “The reason they’re doing this is to send a message to the rest of the stations to be careful” about running anti-Trump ads.
Unlike many other states, Wisconsin doesn’t have a law that makes complainants pay for defendants’ legal costs if a defamation suit ends up being dismissed as frivolous.
Seager estimates that fighting a defamation lawsuit brought by a high-profile group like the Trump campaign could cost anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000, just to go through the process of getting it dismissed.
We asked the Trump campaign and its lawyers about the suit and why they chose WJFW. They did not respond.
The TV station commented, through a lawyer, that “WJFW has no choice but to fight the Trump campaign’s attempt to bully a small-market broadcaster into surrendering its First Amendment rights. The public counts on local broadcasters, especially in an election year, to remain free to air criticisms of public officials.”
Of course, one critical difference between lawsuits Trump used to file in his business dealings and the ones his campaign is filing is that Trump no longer has to use his own money. His donors are picking up the tab.
Trump’s disclosures show his campaign has paid about $200,000 to the firm handling the Wisconsin case.
The campaign has also paid $3.3 million to the firm of attorney Charles Harder, who specializes in high-profile reputation defense lawsuits. Harder is representing the Trump campaign in the three other defamation suits against media organizations. Harder is perhaps best known as the lawyer who successfully sued Gawker into bankruptcy on Hulk Hogan’s behalf while being surreptitiously funded by venture capitalist Peter Thiel.
Another set of expenses in the disclosures is also interesting. It shows the Trump campaign spent $95,161 on “legal & IT consulting” paid to … “The Trump Corporation.” Neither the campaign nor Trump’s company responded to questions about those charges.

0,2020-07-23T12:23:18+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/maine-letter-carriers-allege-usps-leadership-willfully-delaying-mail-to-sabotage-postal-service-from-within/,Maine letter carriers allege USPS leadership ‘willfully delaying’ mail to sabotage postal service from within,"A formal complaint filed last week with the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General by a Portland, Maine letter carrier alleges that city Postmaster James Thornton is unlawfully mandating the delay of first-class mail in order to prioritize the delivery of Amazon packages.
The complaint, first reported Tuesday by the Portland Press Herald, comes weeks after Louis DeJoy took over as U.S. Postmaster General and wasted little time implementing “major operational changes” and cost-cutting measures at the agency that critics warned would slow mail delivery and leave USPS unable to compete with private-sector competitors.
Before he was unanimously appointed by the USPS Board of Governors in May, DeJoy was a major donor to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. The Board of Governors is controlled by Trump appointees.
Mark Seitz, the 16-year Postal Service veteran who lodged the Inspector General complaint on July 13, told the Press Herald that he suspects Thornton’s orders to prioritize the delivery of Amazon packages over first-class mail came in response to pressure from national USPS leadership.
“Thornton is willfully delaying thousands of first-class and priority parcels so that fourth-class Amazon parcels can go out for delivery instead,” reads Seitz’s complaint.
The Press Herald summarized the changes Thornton is imposing at the Portland Post Office:
Typically, letter carriers sort a small amount of mail in the morning before they begin their routes. If mail isn’t sorted by the time carriers leave, they return midday to collect it or an assistant carrier would step in and ensure that all the mail is delivered on time. Now, according to letter carriers inside the Portland post office, clerks are told to stop sorting by 8:30 am, an hour and a half before most carriers leave for their routes, and are then sent home to cut costs, leaving first-class parcels unsorted in the office overnight.
According to letter carriers in Portland, it’s medications, paychecks, and other first-class mail that’s getting left in the office overnight. They say Amazon packages are taking priority at the order of the postmaster and other supervisors in the building.
Seitz’s allegation, according to the Press Herald, “was corroborated by two other letter carriers who said they wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.”
The operational changes described by Portland mail carriers resemble a new initiative the USPS officially launched Wednesday titled “Expedited to Street/Afternoon Sortation (ESAS).”
Under the new program, according to a USPS document posted on Twitter by The Intercept‘s Ryan Grim, “city carriers will not sort any mail during the morning operation.”
“They will clock in, retrieve mail that was pulled down from the previous day,” the document reads. “Any unsorted First Class flats will go directly to the street with the carrier and be routed in delivery sequence while on the street. Upon return from the street delivery, carriers will sort all mail, as directed by management. During this time they will also handle any ancillary duties previously performed in the morning.”
In response to the new initiative, Grim tweeted that “we’re watching the deliberate destruction of the Post Office unfolding in front of us.”
Asked about the new directives, an unnamed mail carrier told HuffPost reporter Dave Jamieson that “these orders are immoral to me.”
“Is that our new motto? ‘If we don’t get it done today, we’ll get it done tomorrow?'” the mail carrier said.
The changes come as the USPS is in the midst of a financial crisis manufactured by Congress and made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused a sharp decline in mail volume. Congress approved $10 billion in emergency relief funds for USPS in March, but the Trump administration has refused to release the money as it seeks to force changes to the agency’s finances and operations.
In a message to the American Postal Workers Union’s 200,000 members Monday, the organization’s National Executive Board accused DeJoy of advancing the Trump administration’s privatization agenda by attempting to “undermine service to the point that the people no longer trust and support it.”
“Without consultation or input from any of the postal unions, postal customers, or mailing community, he has launched a series of actions that will undermine the Postal Service and are an insult to every postal worker, every postal craft, and every postal customer,” the board said.
“The American Postal Workers Union vehemently opposes any actions that slow down and undermine mail processing, delivery, and retail services and thus drives business and revenue away from the Postal Service,” the message continued. “United with each other and the people of the country we will defeat those who aim to dismantle and sell off the public Postal Service.”

Here are the criteria:
Powerful and continuing nationalism
Disdain for human rights
Identification of enemies as a unifying cause
Rampant sexism
Controlled mass media
Obsession with national security
Religion and government intertwined
Corporate power protected
Labor power suppressed
Disdain for intellectuals and the arts
Obsession with crime and punishment
Rampant cronyism and corruption
This in too many ways is America in the Age of Trump.
Trump and his regime are engaged in a white supremacist counterrevolution against the civil rights movement, in which the human rights of nonwhite people are being revoked. This includes a recent effort to circumvent the Constitution by deeming that undocumented immigrants (overwhelmingly Black and brown people) should be erased from the population for purposes of congressional representation.
Trump and his regime are criminalizing dissent. He has gone so far as to explicitly state that people who disagree with him are akin to Nazis and should be imprisoned or worse.
Trump and his regime have no respect for the rule of law, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights or democratic norms and principles more generally. Trump has repeatedly suggested that he will not respect the outcome of the 2020 election if he does not win.
Trump and his regime have unleashed a secret federal police force to gas, shoot, beat and illegally detain nonviolent protesters in Portland, Oregon, and potentially elsewhere.
In a predictable escalation, Trump — through Attorney General William Barr — has ordered that the regime’s thugs be deployed to other Democrat-led cities to enforce “law and order.” It is entirely plausible that Trump’s secret police will also be used to help him steal the presidential election.
Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, recently announced that the forces under his command may  “proactively” arrest people for crimes they have not yet committed. Such dystopian logic mixes George Orwell’s “1984” with Philip K. Dick’s “Minority Report.”
TrumpWorld also reflects the horrible surrealism of the film and novel “Children of Men” turned into a lived experience for America and the world. Writing at the New Statesman, Gavin Jacobson observes:
The way the film extrapolates from the here and now is the reason the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher thought “Children of Men” was unique. Writing in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Fisher understood the film as a true depiction of what he called “‘capitalist realism’: the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it.”
  “Children of Men” does not take place at the end of the world, which has already happened, but within its chilling coda, where, as Fisher writes, “internment camps and franchise coffee bars co-exist”. There is no desire to create alternate ways of living, or to make the end of times less awful. …
  The idea that we’re out of time is what makes “Children of Men” both a mirror and augur of the world, and the world to come. At the end of history, cut off from its past and pessimistic about the future, and facing slow death under rising tides, humanity has resigned itself to a somnambulant life. It is a life of finitude, routine and conformity; one without vision, spontaneity or surprise, where we no longer seek to live larger lives or even strive for our continued existence. We have become Nietzsche’s “last men”.
Facing the onslaught of neo-fascism, the American people remain stuck in a state of denial, learned helplessness and fear. Donald Trump and his movement have American democracy and civil society in a chokehold.
Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University and an expert in fascism and authoritarianism. She is the author of “Fascist Modernities: Italy 1922-1945” and “Italian Fascism’s Empire Cinema” and other books.
Her opinion essays and other writing have been featured by CNN, the Washington Post, The New Yorker and the Atlantic. Ben-Ghiat’s new book is “Strongmen: From Mussolini to the Present,” to be published in November.
In this conversation she warns that Trump’s threats of violence against the American people — including against leading Democrats like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton — are very real. Ben-Ghiat also explains that the American news media normalized Donald Trump because most journalists are unable to admit that the United States is a failing democracy.
Ben-Ghiat details how the American people (and America’s political elites) remain in denial about the realities of neo-fascism and autocracy, because to admit the truth would mean confronting the fact that they must take action against such forces — and have not done so.
You can also listen to my conversation with Ruth Ben-Ghiat on my podcast “The Truth Report” or through the player embedded below.
This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.
The mainstream news media is finally using the words “fascism” and “authoritarianism” to describe Donald Trump and his regime. I have been using such language since Trump’s campaign in 2015. You and other historians, political scientists, philosophers, mental health experts and others have also been sounding the alarm about Donald Trump and what he represents. We were largely ignored and branded as being hysterical. How does it feel to see the proper language finally being used to describe Trump and the threat he represents?
I’m divided. I’m disgusted with how bad things have become in this country. I remember the first time I saw the word “authoritarian” on a chyron for CNN. It was actually because Sen. Cory Booker, who’s been very smart about this crisis, was speaking and he used the word. CNN finally displayed the word on the screen, and I thought to myself, “Oh my God, the efforts of many of us are finally getting into the system.”
Historians and others have been trying to engage in civic education, to help the public and journalists understand that yes, it can happen here. Ultimately, to see CNN and other major media outlets finally use the word “authoritarianism” to describe Donald Trump and this administration means that things are really bad in America right now.
Unfortunately, those voices in the mainstream American news media who are finally describing the Trump regime in those terms then fail to engage in a substantive discussion of the implications.
I think it’s difficult for people to digest what that would mean, for a few reasons. One is that we are still operating with an old-fashioned idea of what authoritarian countries are like. That is one of the reasons I use the word “fascistic” as opposed to “fascism” to describe Donald Trump. When we use the word “fascism” most people think of an instant shutdown of democracy and brown shirts and other political thugs in the streets.
Many people will also rebut the claim that Trump is fascist by using superficial examples such as “There’s still a free press. People can still speak out.” The reality is that today’s authoritarianism works differently than it did in previous incarnations. Today’s version of fascism does not need one-party states, for example. In discussing Trump and fascism, it is more effective to talk about how it operates at present.
What would the narrative be if the American media were covering the events which are taking place under Donald Trump, but in another country?
What is going on corresponds to what I call the authoritarian playbook. Donald Trump is not interested in governing the United States.  He’s in office to enrich himself off public office, help his cronies and build his personality cult. Again, people are anchored to an old-fashioned understanding of what the presidency should be in a democratic country. It is very hard for the public to make the leap to how Trump is a fundamental break from American tradition.
Now, if we start explaining how America is in fact in an authoritarian situation with Donald Trump and his administration, then another question arises. One of the reasons so many people are scared is that to admit the truth about Trump and authoritarianism then means they have to do something about it. Many people do not want to take that leap.
Yes, there are protesters in the streets. But the American business elite also must make that leap by accepting the reality of the situation. History teaches us that it is conservatives who support authoritarians and their rise to power. The American business elites are going to have to change how they think. They are going to have to speak out against American authoritarianism and Trumpism. American business elites have to make a decision about where they stand relative to Trump and authoritarianism.
The American people are going to need to make decisions about where they stand as well. It is easier to not make a decision. It is easier to just flip the channel, shift the topic, and pretend Trump and American authoritarianism are not really happening.
There is this cadre of establishment journalists, analysts and other members of the chattering class whom I describe as “hope peddlers.” They are always trying to spin some happy story about a return to normalcy. They are also many of the same people who are stenographers of current events but not really speaking truth to power. We see this with much of the horse-race journalism regarding the 2020 election. They are operating from the wrong playbook for understanding authoritarianism and a failing democracy. One obvious example is the widespread assumption that there will even be a real election on Nov. 3.
Americans have no experience with authoritarianism and a failing democracy. America has never been invaded by a foreign power and occupied. Americans have never had a dictatorship. Of course, there is the obvious exception of black Americans and their experience with Jim Crow, slavery and oppression. But as a national lived experience for most Americans, the country has not experienced a dictatorship or anything like it.
White Americans are now discovering what people of color have long known, that we do not have a real democracy in this country. Many Americans are finding it very difficult to wake up from the stories they learned in school about this being the freest nation in the world and a successful democracy.
At what point is it to late to save a democracy that is falling into authoritarianism?
Historically, when there are people who have signed on to their roles within an authoritarian fascistic state it is very hard to dislodge such people. They cling to the status quo of the corrupt leader for dear life. This happens because of cronyism and corruption. Everyone involved with the regime is made complicit.
Of course, this is what happened in Putin’s Russia and other authoritarian states. The system is one of mutual complicity. That means not wanting to rock the boat because the whole system could come tumbling down. For example, if you think about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and how the public was waiting for them to start the impeachment against Donald Trump, there was a clear sense that they did not want to cause fundamental disruption. Why? Because the American political class is intertwined.
There was a sense earlier on with Trump that nobody wanted to rock the boat. I do think we as a country are in a different place now, given all that has happened with the Trump administration.
But the whole situation in America right now is still too upsetting and too uncertain for most people. The country’s elites and the people in their circle know they could lose their privileges. They will potentially lose their careers. They’ll have to make compromises. The hope-peddling which involves just staying the course is much more appealing. That is the reason why Nancy Pelosi recently said, “No, we’re not going to impeach Barr. We’re going to let the people speak through the election.” That is the mentality of the country’s political elites and a fear of rocking the boat too much.
Trump is very obvious. There is no subtlety in his threats of violence against the Democrats and his other “enemies,” which include any Americans who dare to disagree with him and his movement. Why is still there so much denial of this reality by the American people and political leaders?
Sometimes people simple do not know what to do. They feel powerless. They can become numb because Trump and his agents are flooding the zone with waste, as Steve Bannon said of his right-wing takeover strategy. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to react to any one single crisis.
The huge danger is that it is quite probable that Donald Trump will be elected again. Trump will in fact try to put Barack Obama on trial. Trump is obsessed with him. Trump’s obsession is not unlike that of other right-wing authoritarians with their predecessors.
Donald Trump is not kidding when he says he considers Barack Obama to be a traitor and wants to undo everything that Obama has done, to literally try to cancel Obama. Donald Trump is not kidding when he says he wants to put Obama in prison. It is important to take Trump’s threats seriously.
How do you locate Trump’s threats of violence — and the actual violence by his street thugs and other enforcers — relative to other examples in history?
This is why it’s important to have an up-to-date sense of how authoritarianism evolves. If we keep using the fascism of the Holocaust and World War II violence as the standard of judgment, then Donald Trump and leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan are always going to look good. For example, mass detention rather than mass killing is the way that many authoritarians today operate.
The conditions in some of Trump’s detention centers for migrants, refugees and other undocumented people have been labeled by outside observers as constituting torture. Many things that are happening right now in America under Trump resemble the security techniques that America used on other countries. One of the ironies of the Trump era is that all of that American military might that supported right-wing authoritarians abroad for decades is coming home to roost.
How did you interpret the rapid series of events with Trump’s response to the George Floyd protests, his retreat to the White House bunker, the military’s de facto refusal to follow Trump’s orders for martial law, and the attacks he ordered on protesters?
It is a compressed cycle of many things that happen when authoritarians start to fall from power. There is the fleeing into the bunker and the protests — which are not only about Trump, they’re about entrenched institutional racism. The protests continue because the American people know that there is an actual white supremacist in the White House. With the fleeing into the bunker there is also the retaliation, the barrage against the public from the leader. That is Trump’s order to use the military against the protesters in Washington.
There is also another dimension to this cycle, elite defections. Members of the government start to speak out. There are people who finally decide that the leader has gone too far.
There was a hint of this with Gen. James Mattis speaking out against Trump’s use of the military in the United States against the American people and his threats of martial law. Gen. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, publicly said, “I was wrong. I shouldn’t have been used for this photo-op.”
Trump’s photo-op, where he tried to look strong by walking to the church across the street from the White House after the attack on the protesters, was also right out of the authoritarian playbook. These events are very revealing as to how far Trump will go to stay in power — and the potential dissent and resistance from the highest levels of the United States military as well.
What is the role of death, masculinity and violence in a fascistic and/or authoritarian regime?
These leaders, including Trump, genuinely do not care if you live or die. They could not care less. You are just a tool to be used so they can stay in power and enrich themselves. That’s the premise. That is why they lead people into losing wars. They repress them. They do things that some people consider self-destructive — but in fact there is no greater power for the egocentric, narcissistic authoritarian than having people sacrifice themselves for him.
An example of this was Donald Trump daring people to go to his Tulsa rally with no masks on in the middle of a pandemic. This has not been stressed enough in terms of the public’s understanding of Donald Trump. Trump engages in male domination games with everyone. Trump even did it to Mike Pence when he announced that Pence would be his running mate in 2016.
What greater ego rush for Donald Trump than to have his supporters risk their lives for the joy of listening to him speak in person? Donald Trump will gladly send the American people to their deaths — his own supporters included — because they are just tools for him. Traditional understandings of what it means to be president in a democracy do not account for this. The public does not want to comprehend the behavior of Donald Trump.
Why are so many people willing to die for Donald Trump? For that matter, why are so many of his supporters willing to kill for him?
They are a death cult. During World War II, Germans killed themselves for Hitler. Trump shows how such things can happen even in a nominal democracy. The self-destruction for the leader makes it even more scary because it is voluntary. So many Republicans, Lindsey Graham for example, have prostituted themselves to Donald Trump. Of course such people have their own agendas and actually believe that they are using Donald Trump and not the other way around. No one is holding a death sentence over these people who have prostituted themselves to Donald Trump. It is not like one of the other authoritarian regimes where supporting the leader was and is a literal matter of life and death. Trump just fires people. In other countries a person who the leader was done with would be put in prison or killed.
If Putin is displeased with somebody, he finds a way to put them in prison, or sometimes poison them. The stakes in the United States with Trump are so much lower at present. What is going to happen to someone who stands up and does the right thing? They might not have as great of a career. They might not be asked to sit on boards of directors. They’ll lose out on some money. They might be shunned at their church. But overall, it is not a life and death situation. It is a very sad situation that more people from Trump’s administration and the United States government do not speak out. It is a spectacle of the cravenness of humanity that we are all seeing in the Trump era.
Let us assume that there is a presidential election in November and that Trump is defeated by Joe Biden. What happens next?
Authoritarian leaders do not experience defeat like other types of people. They are not normal people who would just give up the office and step down. Defeat is a form of psychological annihilation for a leader like Donald Trump. For men like Trump, authoritarians, their sense of self-worth is completely determined by adulation and having the power to bully people. It makes leaders such as Donald Trump feel good.
If authoritarian leaders feel that power is being taken away from them, they get very angry. They will do desperate things to prove to themselves that they are still loved. I would expect him to energize right-wing gun fanatics to create civil unrest because he wants to show the American people — his supporters — that without him being president the country will truly descend into anarchy. I would be very surprised that if Trump lost on Election Day to Joe Biden, he doesn’t do horrible things. It is the only way that he can show himself, in his own fantasy world, that he truly is the savior of the country.
What advice would you give to the American people about the next few months and how to prepare for what may happen with Trump and the election?

“I decided in probably January or February when I heard that the first case of coronavirus was in Venice, I said to everyone around me that if it’s in Venice, it’s in the United States. … the [Trump administration] didn’t take it seriously from the very beginning.”
She went on to chronicle Trump’s repeated downplaying of the virus — “All this B.S., that I knew at the time was B.S.,” she said, adding that Trump’s rhetoric on coronavirus has turned into “full blown delusions.”
“At that moment I decided that he no longer has my vote.”

Speaking to the Washington Post, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) confessed it’s because they don’t want to spend the money.
“There are some over here that think we benefit from doing nothing because people don’t want to spend any more money,” he said. “I’d say it’s gonna be tough.”
It was assumed that Republicans would be more willing to deal because it is an election year, and many are desperate to keep their seats in November. Yet, the unprecedented pandemic and national emergency didn’t seem as urgent as one might assume.
In a scathing piece, the Post editorial board blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for dragging his feet and not jumping to help a country in crisis. Democrats, by contrast, passed their next version of the stimulus in Congress in May. McConnell has let it sit for two months with no action.
“Cramer said he thought it was possible that even if they succeed in overcoming their internal differences, Republicans would be unable to bridge the ‘pretty big gap’ with Democrats, who have embraced a $3 trillion bill containing multiple priorities Republicans oppose, such as a large package of aid for cities and states, among other things,” the report said.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the GOP that if they didn’t act by the end of next week, millions of Americans would lose their unemployment benefits.

0,2020-07-23T11:17:44+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/dhs-employees-worry-that-portland-will-hurt-agencys-image-its-way-too-late-for-that/,DHS employees worry that Portland will hurt agency’s image. It’s way too late for that,"Nearly 20 anonymous Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees tell BuzzFeed News that they’re really worried about how the use of state-sanctioned kidnappings and other violent force against protesters in Portland, Oregon, looks for them, with one saying unleashing Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents and others on the city “absolutely hurts the reputation of the agency. Most people have no clue what we do, but now they will have this ham-fisted response in their mind as they think about CBP.”
Thanks for speaking up now, I guess. We also can’t help but notice the concerns come as agents are targeting people who aren’t migrants, because CBP has snatched mothers in front of their children before. CBP has tear-gassed other moms at the border. CBP has let migrant kids die on its watch. CBP has shot and killed an unarmed migrant, and then lied about it. If the agency is worried about reputation of all things, it should look in the mirror to see who’s to blame.
One “DHS employee said they’d never seen anything like what’s happening in Portland in their many years at the agency,” BuzzFeed News reported. “’We have a lot of work ahead in terms of repairing the public’s trust,’ the employee said.” But to anyone in the public who has been steadily watching and keeping track of the department’s abuses throughout the years, there’s been no trust in the first place. Just look at other recent developments in the past several days.
Following an internal investigation of a racist and vile Facebook group where members mocked the death of a migrant boy on U.S. watch, only four of the nearly 140 agents investigated for their participation in the group were fired. Heads should have rolled like a bowling alley, but an internal document released by a House committee shows the agency actually shielded some agents from harsher punishment. Unless I missed it, there was no outcry from anonymous DHS employees on that.
There’s real fears that the state attacks in Portland could become deadly, but CBP has already been deadly. Not only did a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report confirm that CBP disregarded a CDC recommendation to give detained people flu shots following the deaths of children in CBP custody in late 2018, a pediatrician recently told Congress and those children’s parents that they could have been saved.
“Unfortunately, the border patrol agents at the forward operating base where Jakelin was apprehended did not conduct sufficient screening to identify her illness before the first bus left for the border patrol station,” Pediatrician Fiona Danaher wrote to the father of Jakelin Ameí Rosmery Caal Maquin. “They also did not have adequate training to recognize how sick she was, and they did not call ahead to request that an ambulance meet your bus en route to the border patrol station.” She was only seven.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is no different in its callousness and cruelty. As it threatens to rip more children and parents apart rather than just release them together from migrant family jails hit by COVID-19, private prison executives contracted with ICE to jail immigrants for the federal government claimed to Congress earlier this month that they had no knowledge of guards using violent force against people protesting their ongoing detention amid the pandemic.
“In reality, people at CoreCivic facilities have been pepper-sprayed on at least four occasions,” a Mother Jones report recently said. “At LaSalle, it’s happened on at least five occasions. And at GEO Group detention centers, the total is also at least five. Hundreds of immigrants and asylum seekers have been exposed to pepper spray during those uses of force.” But why should private executives be worried about lying to Congress when unconfirmed DHS Sec. Chad Wolf lied to Congress about his role in family separation and is still somehow in his job?
In second statement to BuzzFeed News about DHS presence in Portland, another anonymous employee commented that they “did not sign up nor was I trained to be a street cop,” adding that “[c]ivil societies have immigration laws that need to be enforced, but that does not mean we should be used as this delusional president’s personal attack dog just because we happen to be available.” But agents have shown themselves to disregard laws and the rights of people they detain when it’s convenient for them.
“Every yr, approximately 250 CBP employees are arrested, many on suspicion of serious felonies; dozens have been jailed in recent yrs on corruption charges …
During the Obama yrs, critics decried a series of incidents in which Border Patrol agents shot civilians…” #DefundCBP
— Gabe Ortíz (@TUSK81) July 22, 2020
Advocates described CBP’s oversight system “as a black hole, a vortex in which serious complaints are ignored or lost, simple investigations drag on for yrs, and victims are barred from learning whether employees who’ve harmed them have been sanctioned in any way.” #DefundCBP
— Gabe Ortíz (@TUSK81) July 22, 2020
Agreed and if this sounds radical to you remember Britney Spears’ first three albums are all older than DHS https://t.co/5DZo8GTkHd
— Gabe Ortíz (@TUSK81) July 22, 2020
DHS has gotten away with these abuses for years, often in broad daylight. It’s long past time we say, enough. Defund ICE, defund CBP, hold agents and superiors accountable, and stop the abuses.

0,2020-07-23T11:15:19+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/sen-elizabeth-warren-asks-cdc-whether-they-will-use-federal-authority-to-curb-pandemic-spread/,Sen. Elizabeth Warren asks CDC whether they will use federal authority to curb pandemic spread,"As even Donald Trump himself warns that the United States’ COVID-19 pandemic is “going to get worse,” Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a few questions for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield. Broadly phrased, the questions boil down to 1.) what are you planning to do about it and 2.) no, really, is the CDC planning to do a damn thing about it?
In a letter to the CDC director, Warren notes that Redfield himself said that widespread mask usage would “bring this epidemic under control,” notes that the CDC has significant power to stop interstate pandemic spreads when states screw things up themselves, and therefore “Specifically, I would like you to provide me with information on whether the CDC has considered efforts to implement mask requirements, a limit on gatherings, and other measures that the CDC has recommended to stop the spread of the virus.”
Warren, who on Tuesday published her own recommendations for combating the pandemic, wants “information on the CDC’s existing legal authorities to implement and enforce public health measures under section 261 of the Public Health Service Act.” While Redfield’s CDC has issued advisories and guidelines on what actions states should take to curb the pandemic, the CDC and Trump administration have made none of them mandatory. Instead, the administration continues to be more interested in forcing the “mandatory” in-person reopening of schools by threatening to withhold federal funds to any that refuse.
“I would like to know whether the CDC will use its authorities to intervene in instances where state governors or other officials order the removal of restrictions or mask mandates,” Warren wrote.
The answer to this is almost assuredly no, for no better reason than Redfield has been ordered to take no action to prevent state reopenings and has already overseen past watering-down of CDC recommendations to avoid angering Donald Trump. But the letter will provide a jumping-off point for Redfield to attempt to explain his actions before the Senate next grills him on our country’s now-runaway pandemic spread.

John Hyten, thinks his boss is an “idiot,” and the First Lady is “smarter than the president.”
Col. Kathy Spletstoser, who retired from the Army in 2019 after serving for 27 years, “has accused Hyten of sexually assaulting her more than half a dozen times while she was under his command,” The Washington Post reports, “and then retaliating against her — accusations that he has vigorously denied during a military investigation and in front of the Senate.”
Spletstoser is trying to gain access to records she believes will help her case against Hyten. To support her point, she revealed to The Washington Post a conversation she says Hyten had with her, after he attended a dinner with the president and First Lady in October 2017.
“The president is an idiot,” Spletstoser says Hyten told her. “He is just a businessman without the basic understanding of national security. Everything is a business transaction for him and making money is winning to him and the only thing that matters.”
Those remarks should come as no surprise. Other top Trump administration officials have reportedly made similar remarks, including former chief of staff John Kelly, former chief of staff Reince Priebus, and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster. And Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Trump a “dope.”
Spletstoser went on to share the Joint Chiefs’ vice chair’s remarks about the First Lady, which are disturbing – not because of his remarks about her intelligence, but because of her remarks about what he allegedly told her.
“I also spent a lot of time talking to Melania Trump about the locations of all our intercontinental ballistic missile fields. She was more inquisitive and smarter than the president.”
Hyten declined to comment.

0,2020-07-23T10:50:13+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/gop-senate-candidate-pushes-vaccine-conspiracy-claims-masks-cause-more-problems-than-they-solve/,GOP Senate candidate pushes vaccine conspiracy — claims masks ’cause more problems than they solve’,"A New Hampshire Republican Senate candidate on Friday disputed medical experts calling for the use of masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus despite having no science or medical background.
Republican candidates across the country have echoed President Donald Trump’s skepticism about masks on the campaign trail. The president claimed in a recent interview that masks may make people more likely to contract the coronavirus, in addition to suggesting that they are worn as a sign of disapproval of him personally.
Amid sinking poll numbers, Trump on Monday reversed course on his anti-mask rhetoric to declare the wearing of masks “patriotic” Twitter. One day later, he publicly acknowledged in his first White House coronavirus briefing in months that masks “have an impact.” At the same time, the president has refused to wear one in public on all but one occasion or issue an executive order to mandate their use.
Retired Army Brig. General Don Bolduc, who is running in the Republican primary against businessman Corky Messner, himself a climate science denier who has stoked doubts about coronavirus vaccines, echoed Trump’s comments in an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio last week.
“I am unapologetically of the opinion that the masks cause more problems than they solve,” Bolduc declared. “I believe that they collect bacteria. I believe that that they get dirty. I believe that people use the same mask over, and over and over again — and they don’t change it. They don’t change it out. We’ve had a huge littering problem with masks and rubber gloves — and that’s creating a problem.”
Bolduc was pressed on whether issues such as littering “outweigh the scientific benefits” which have been widely discussed by medical experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
“Listen, I’d never get into a scientific argument with Dr. Fauci,” Bolduc replied. “But I listen to other people outside of Dr. Fauci.”
Bolduc argued that masks should be used in a “proper setting, like hospitals.”
“But outside of hospitals, I believe that they’re ineffective,” he said, citing no evidence. “They’re not made of the right material in many cases. They don’t breathe adequately there.”
A study published on the National Institutes of Health website found that the universal use of face masks are effective in preventing the transmission of the coronavirus, even if the masks are made of simple cloth. A study published in the Journal of American Medical Association and circulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that “cloth face coverings are a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19.”
“Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus – particularly when used universally within a community setting,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement last week. “All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families and their communities.”
Though masks are primarily recommended to prevent the spread of the virus to others, studies have also shown that they provide some protection against the virus to the wearer. A study by researchers at University of California – Davis found that face coverings reduce the risk of infection by about 65%. Masks have also been shown to reduce the severity of infection.
Bolduc made the comments to defend his opposition to a statewide mask requirement in New Hampshire. Republican governors in states like Alabama, Arkansas, Texas and West Virginia have issued mask mandates. Though New Hampshire has not seen the large spikes in infection plaguing other states, nearby states like Massachusetts and Maine have issued mask requirements.
Bolduc’s campaign did not respond to questions from Salon. Messner said in a statement that masks have been effective in combatting the spread, but he does “not support a statewide mask requirement.”
“Granite Staters have done an amazing job during this pandemic, demonstrating their willingness to voluntarily observe safe distancing, and when needed, use masks,” Messner said. “Our decreasing infection rate is evidence their efforts have been very effective in containing the spread of the virus here in New Hampshire.”
It is not the first time Bolduc has cited his own personal opinion to argue against public safety and science. Doctors called Bolduc out last month after he appeared to echo a widely-debunked conspiracy theory, also repeated by the right-wing commentators Diamond & Silk, that Microsoft founder Bill Gates wants to implant people with microchips via a coronavirus vaccine.
“This is Bill Gates saying we should put chips inside people now,” Bolduc said during an event in May. “That’s a dangerous violation of my constitutional right.”
“The only bracelets anyone is going to put on me are handcuffs, because I’m fighting for my individual rights, my constitutional rights,” he said at the time. “And the only chip that’s going in me is a Dorito.”
There is, obviously, no evidence that Gates wants to use a coronavirus vaccine, different versions of which are being developed by companies around the world, to implant microchips into anyone.
“I’ve never been involved any sort of microchip-type thing,” Gates told reporters last month. “It’s almost hard to deny this stuff, because it’s so stupid or strange.”
Bolduc said in a statement to NHPR that he was “not opposed to vaccinations” but opposed “increasing reliance on government to tell us what’s best for us.”
“Where there is risk, there must be choice,” he said. “We need to inform and educate parents about the benefits, and if warranted, the side effects of any medication. This is about empowering people to make good decisions.”
Messner has also raised questions over the efficacy and safety of any potential coronavirus vaccine.
“Like all Americans, I look forward to the discovery of a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine,” Messner said in a statement to Salon. “And like flu vaccines, it is up to individuals, in consultation with their doctors, to determine whether or not to be vaccinated.”
Bolduc has also echoed Trump’s baseless conspiracy theory that the coronavirus may have been engineered in a lab in Wuhan, China.
“They (China) started this shit and they weren’t transparent about it,” Bolduc said in a March interview. “And they probably created it in a lab. And now we’re stuck with it. And the whole world is stuck with it.”
He later doubled down in an interview with local news outlet WMUR, arguing that the virus was “probably a biological program they put together and it got beyond their ability to contain” and that it was designed to have a “a fatal effect on our older generation.”
The State Department recently released an internal cable that sparked speculation by the likes of Trump that the virus was created in a Wuhan lab in response to a lawsuit from The Washington Post. The cable showed no evidence to support the idea that the virus was released “deliberately or inadvertently,” the outlet reported.
“There are lots of data and lots of evidence, as well as previous examples of this coming from nature,” Kristian Anderson, a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research Institute who studied the origins of the virus said. “We have exactly zero evidence or data of this having any connection to a lab.”
A group of doctors led by state Rep. Dr. Gary Wood, a Democrat, called on both candidates last month to stop pushing “harmful conspiracy theories that could undermine the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The letter noted that Bolduc has also “claimed, without evidence, [vaccines] could somehow harm children.”
“While there is no vaccine yet, we know that widespread vaccination — meaning 60 to 80 percent of the world — would be necessary to achieve herd immunity and allow us to safely resume daily life without fear of contagion,” the doctors wrote. “With candidates like you two fear-mongering about vaccines and spreading false conspiracy theories, widespread vaccination in our communities becomes much less likely, endangering our most at-risk populations.”

0,2020-07-23T10:28:15+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/gop-floats-slashing-boosted-unemployment-payments-to-100-per-week-contempt-for-the-american-people/,GOP floats slashing boosted unemployment payments to $100 per week: ‘Contempt for the American people’,"With the final boosted unemployment check set to go out in just three days barring an unlikely last-minute extension by Congress, Senate Republicans are reportedly considering a proposal to slash the $600-per-week benefit boost to $100—a cut that would drastically reduce the incomes of 30 million Americans and potentially cause massive job loss.
First reported by CNBC, the Republican proposal comes as progressive advocacy groups, Democratic lawmakers, and economists are warning of the devastating consequences of letting the enhanced unemployment payments expire at the end of the month. The Republican plan would pay out the $100-per-week boost through the end of the year.
The $600 weekly benefit increase technically expires on July 31, a Friday, but because states pay unemployment benefits on Saturdays or Sundays, the last enhanced payments are set to go out on July 25 and 26. Talks over the next Covid-19 stimulus package are expected to stretch into August, meaning unemployment benefits will likely revert to pre-pandemic levels—which average around $333 per week nationwide—for at least one payment cycle.
Sparking warnings of a major housing crisis, expiration of the supercharged unemployment benefits is set to coincide with the end of an eviction moratorium shielding more than 12 million people who live in homes with federally backed mortgages.
Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said the $100-per-week proposal shows “Senate Republicans are wildly out of touch with reality.” If adopted, the GOP proposal would reduce the monthly payments to millions of out-of-work Americans from $2,400 to $400.
“Seriously, just $400 a month?” Beyer tweeted late Wednesday. “Cutting monthly income for 30 million families by $2,000 would cost the country millions of jobs. This wouldn’t just be horrible governance, it would show contempt for the American people.”
Economic Policy Institute research director Josh Bivens estimated that reducing the weekly unemployment insurance (UI) boost from $600 to $100 would cost the U.S. more than four million jobs over the next year.
“Both cruel and stupid,” Bivens said.
Negotiations over the next coronavirus stimulus package are still in flux as Republicans, Democrats, and the White House remain miles apart on key issues, including the unemployment benefit boost. According to the Associated Press, Senate Republicans appear to be leaning toward cutting the $600 weekly payment to $200—still a sharp income cut for tens of millions of people.
Politico reported late Wednesday that “many rank-and-file Democrats say they are willing to compromise on the extra $600 per week, saying they would be open to less money as long as there is no lapse in benefits. Others say they won’t back down on that number.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expected to roll out the GOP package on Thursday, two days after laughing off the possibility that any Covid-19 legislation will pass by the end of next week.
On Wednesday afternoon, protesters marched to McConnell’s home in Washington, D.C. demanding an extension of the $600-per-week UI boost.
“Without the $600, we would be in dire straits,” one protester told a local ABC affiliate. “With the kids being home during the pandemic, it helps an awful lot, because there’s always something needed, there’s always something that has to be done.”

Of course, this is a common tactic in President Donald Trump’s administration. As soon as it becomes convenient, abandon any allies and blame them for any mistakes.
But in this case, the attempt is so cynical and transparent to anyone with a long-term memory that it’s hard to believe it could work at all. Conway apparently wants us to forget Trump’s attitude toward the pandemic for the last three months. She made this clear as she blamed states for opening up too quickly and triggering a resurgence of the coronavirus, even though that’s exactly what Trump urged them to do.
“Some of these states blew through the phases, blew through our gated criteria, blew through our phases, and they opened up some of the industries a little too quickly, like bars,” she told a group of reporters. “Remember, the governors wanted complete latitude over when they would open their states. They pushed back heavily, handsomely, Republicans and Democrats, when it was falsely rumored that the president was going to be in charge of opening the states.”
“He encouraged them to open—” a reporter pointed out.
“But not everybody has,” she said. “And remember, he pushed back on the governor of Georgia, a Republican, who he frankly helped get elected, he pushed back on him early. And some people didn’t like that. But he did that, he said publicly to all of you: ‘I think it’s just a little too early. Why don’t we wait a little bit longer?’ So the president was already on the record doing that long before these other states decided whether they would open or not.”
In these remarks, Conway was trying to blatantly rewrite history. She’s right that on April 23, Trump told Gov. Brian Kemp he was moving to quickly to reopen Georgia. But that move was itself a reversal — Trump had been signaling in the days prior that he was eager to see states reopen.  Trump has already thrown his support behind anti-lockdown protesters, calling to “liberate” states from restrictive coronavirus countermeasures.
And while Trump did pump the brakes lightly that week, he soon aggressively jammed on the gas to reopen the country in contradiction of his administration’s own guidelines. The fact that the virus is now surging through the country and deaths from COVID-19 are rising for the third straight week in a row is a direct consequence of that recklessness.
It was clear at the time how reckless Trump was being, and experts across the country warned against it. But despite Conway’s denials, it was Trump himself who took the lead on reopening.
On April 28, Trump was already telling states to consider reopening schools.
On May 4, the Washington Post reported:
States across the country are moving swiftly to reopen their economies despite failing to achieve benchmarks laid out by the White House for when social distancing restrictions could be eased to ensure the public’s safety during the coronavirus pandemic.
These governors’ biggest cheerleader is President Trump.
A slew of states — such as Texas, Indiana, Colorado and Florida — have pushed forward with relaxing social distancing guidelines even as the number of people testing positive in many states has increased in recent weeks and testing continues to lag behind. White House recommendations released last month encouraged states to wait to see a decline in cases over a two-week period, as well as having robust testing in place for front-line workers before entering “Phase One” of a gradual comeback.
Texas and Florida are among the states that have since seen major spikes in cases and deaths.
And on May 22 — despite Conway claiming Trump cares about federalism and respecting states’ independence — Trump threatened to “override” any governor who did not permit religious services to return to their halls of worship. Experts have warned that such gatherings have many of the conditions most prone to allow rampant spread of the virus.
So there’s no getting away from it. However much Conway tries to lie and spin her way out of it, she admitted that the premature reopenings are to blame for the virus’s resurgence. And the blame for the push to reopen early — not to mention the failure to create an infrastructure for tracking and suppressing the virus — falls squarely on Trump’s shoulders.

0,2020-07-23T01:29:27+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/hannity-immediately-contradicts-trumps-grim-admission-about-the-pandemic/,Hannity immediately contradicts Trump’s grim admission about the pandemic,"Fox News host Sean Hannity on Tuesday evening appeared to contradict President Donald Trump’s admission at an earlier White House coronavirus briefing that the pandemic would grow worse.
Hannity told his primetime viewers that “the situation is getting better — not worse.” In a rare, somber moment hours earlier, Trump had told reporters that the pandemic “will get worse before it gets better.”
“That’s something I don’t like saying — but it is,” the president added.
That evening, Hannity, who on Monday was named as a co-defendant in a sexual misconduct lawsuit filed against the network, showered the president with praise. However, in an apparent continuation of his attempt to defend Trump, Hannity also directly contradicted the president:
By the way, President Trump never stopped working. The pandemic is not spiraling out of control, as they projected nightly. It is the worst pandemic since 1918. Losing one life is way too many.
The situation is getting better — not worse. And, by the way, none of these people on TV — and no Democrats — supported the travel ban 10 days after the first identified case of coronavirus, then the subsequent travel bans and the first quarantine in over 50 years. That alone — huge decisions that save lives. This administration has fulfilled every request from every state governor.
New York Times data earlier that day showed that the country had seen more than 1,100 deaths and more than 65,000 new cases in the previous 24 hours. In that time, the total number of reported U.S. deaths passed 142,000, and infections closed in on 4 million.
The previous week was the first to show a net increase in reported U.S. deaths since mid-April.
That same month, the University of Chicago published a study which found that “greater viewership of ‘Hannity’ relative to ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’ was strongly associated with a greater number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the early stages of the pandemic.”
Trump has downplayed the pandemic from the outset. Among numerous other instances and patterns, he compared it falsely to the flu; claimed numerous times that it would “miraculously” vanish in April “with the heat”; predicted that the country’s 15 reported cases would soon zero out; urged states to reopen their economies in defiance of guidance from his own health experts; attacked Democratic governors who would not move at the pace he demanded; chalked up his country’s world-leading case count to expanded testing; routinely misled the country with false claims about statistics and models; pushed for schools to reopen amid rising death counts; and refused to wear a mask until recent days, even though his administration’s own research-based guidelines first laid out in April.
However, in his first White House coronavirus briefing in months, Trump, with his numbers plummeting in recent Fox News polling, appeared to concede that he was tethered to a grim reality. He encouraged Americans to wear masks, and at one point showed off his own navy blue face covering bearing the presidential seal. However, he did not personally demonstrate it.
“Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact,” he said, later adding: “I’m getting used to the mask.”
But Hannity, who often communicates directly with Trump and has been thought to at times exert a degree of influence on policy, did not seem to get the message.
The host instead attacked Democratic officials and news outlets for being selectively pessimistic and ignoring positive developments, such as heartening reports about progress on a vaccine — a story that all national outlets have covered, including Salon.
Fox News generally has served for months as a bastion of coronavirus misinformation, a reliable presidential redoubt from the slings and arrows of facts. A Media Matters audit of the cable network in May showed its coronavirus coverage had declined 20% over two months, while other networks rarely eased back.
Earlier this month, the media watchdog rolled out another study, which found that Fox News had peddled misinformation about the pandemic 253 times in the span of five days, 35% of which came from the “straight news” side of the network.

Many public health professionals and politicians are urging or requiring citizens to wear face masks to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Some Americans have refused, wrongly claiming mask decrees violate the Constitution. An internet search turns up dozens of examples.
“Costco Karen,” for instance, staged a sit-in in a Costco entrance in Hillsboro, Oregon after she refused to wear a mask, yelling “I am an American … I have rights.”
A group called Health Freedom Idaho organized a protest against a Boise, Idaho, mask mandate. One protester said, “I’m afraid where this country is headed if we just all roll over and abide by control that goes against our constitutional rights.”
As one protester said, “The coronavirus doesn’t override the Constitution.”
Speaking as a constitutional law scholar, these objections are nonsense.
The objections
It is not always clear why anti-maskers think government orders requiring face coverings in public spaces or those put in place by private businesses violate their constitutional rights, much less what they think those rights are. But most of the mistaken objections fall into two categories:
Mandatory masks violate the First Amendment right to speech, assembly, and especially association and mandatory masks violate a person’s constitutional right to liberty and to make decisions about their own health and bodily integrity.
They’re not mutually exclusive claims: A lawsuit filed by four Florida residents against Palm Beach County, for example, argues that mask mandates “interfere with … personal liberty and constitutional rights,” such as freedom of speech, right to privacy, due process, and the “constitutionally protected right to enjoy and defend life and liberty.” The lawsuit asks the court to issue a permanent injunction against the county’s mask mandate.
[Deep knowledge, daily. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]
Responding to a reporter who asked why President Donald Trump appeared unconcerned about the absence of masks and social distancing at a campaign rally in Tulsa, Vice President Mike Pence said: “I want to remind you again freedom of speech and the right to peaceably assemble is in the Constitution of the U.S. Even in a health crisis, the American people don’t forfeit our constitutional rights.”
What the First Amendment does – and doesn’t – do
The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, press, petition, assembly and religion.
There are two reasons why mask mandates don’t violate the First Amendment.
First, a mask doesn’t keep you from expressing yourself. At most, it limits where and how you can speak. Constitutional law scholars and judges call these “time, place, and manner” restrictions. If they do not discriminate on the basis of the content of the speech, such restrictions do not violate the First Amendment. An example of a valid time, place and manner restriction would be a law that limits political campaigning within a certain distance of a voting booth.
Additionally, the First Amendment, like all liberties ensured by the Constitution, is not absolute.
All constitutional rights are subject to the goverment’s authority to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. This authority is called the “police power.” The Supreme Court has long held that protecting public health is sufficient reason to institute measures that might otherwise violate the First Amendment or other provisions in the Bill of Rights. In 1944, in the case of Prince v. Massachusetts, for example, the Supreme Court upheld a law that prohibited parents from using their children to distribute religious pamphlets on public streets.
The right to liberty
Some anti-maskers object that masks violate the right to liberty.
The right to liberty, including the right to make choices about one’s health and body, is essentially a constitutional principle of individual autonomy, neatly summarized as “My body, my choice.”
The 1905 case of Jacobsen v. Massachusetts shows why mask mandates don’t violate any constitutional right to privacy or health or bodily integrity. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld a smallpox vaccination requirement in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The court said that the vaccination requirement did not violate Jacobsen’s right to liberty or “the inherent right of every freeman to care for his own body and health in such way as to him seems best.”
As the court wrote, “There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. On any other basis, organized society could not exist with safety to its members.” In a 1995 New York case, a state court held that an individual with active tuberculosis could be forcibly detained in a hospital for appropriate medical treatment.
Even if you assume that mask mandates infringe upon what the Supreme Court calls “fundamental rights,” or rights that the court has called the “very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty,” it has consistently ruled states can act if the restrictions advance a compelling state interest and do so in the least restrictive manner.
Rights are conditional
As the Jacobsen ruling and the doctrine of time, place and manner make clear, the protection of all constitutional liberties rides upon certain necessary – but rarely examined – assumptions about communal and public life.
One is that constitutional rights – whether to liberty, speech, assembly, freedom of movement or autonomy – are held on several conditions. The most basic and important of these conditions is that our exercise of rights must not endanger others (and in so doing violate their rights) or the public welfare. This is simply another version of the police power doctrine.
Unfortunately, a global pandemic in which a serious and deadly communicable disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers upsets that background and justifies a wide range of reasonable restrictions on our liberties. Believing otherwise makes the Constitution a suicide pact – and not just metaphorically.

0,2020-07-23T00:59:47+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/stephen-miller-gets-added-to-splcs-extremist-files/,Stephen Miller gets added to SPLC’s ‘Extremist Files’,"Civil rights organization Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has added Trump administration official and noted white supremacist Stephen Miller to its “Extremists Files” for his role in implementing some of the most inhumane and racist immigration policies in modern U.S. history, putting this taxpayer-paid official alongside notorious racists and bigots like former KKK grand wizard David Duke and dead homophobe Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church.
“Stephen Miller is the architect behind some of the most draconian anti-immigrant policies that we’ve seen from the Trump administration,” SPLC senior investigative reporter Michael Edison Hayden said in a statement received by Daily Kos, stating that leaked communications with fellow racists from before he joined the White House “essentially provided a roadmap for the dehumanizing and hateful policies that we’ve seen enacted under this administration.”
“Through the conscious use of fearmongering and xenophobia, Miller implements policies which demonize immigrants, regardless of their immigration status, in an apparent effort to halt all forms of immigration to the United States,” the SPLC said in its new “Extremists” profile on the notorious racist, who was a Senate aide to Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III before joining the White House to implement his white supremacist vision.
Emails leaked to SPLC from that time and leading up through impeached president Donald Trump’s campaign revealed Miller promoted the racist propaganda of anti-immigrant hate group Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) dozens of times. Someone as vile as Miller might actually be pleased to know that he’s listed alongside CIS’ founder, eugenist John Tanton, in the SPLC files. In other leaked emails, Miller echoed paranoid, white supremacist conspiracy theory around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which he would later help end after joining impeached president Donald Trump to occupy the White House.
“In the trove of emails analyzed by Hatewatch, Miller vocalized a belief in the idea that DACA recipients would advance the reshaping of the U.S.’ demographics by replacing native born citizens,” the report said. “On June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to end the program in a 5-4 ruling.” Trump and Miller had fully expected a win from the conservative court, so this lawless administration is now just openly defying the courts and refusing to fully reopen the program to new applicants.
Miller has also been one of officials responsible for the impeached president’s latest order stomping on legal immigration, SPLC notes: “Most recently, on April 21, 2020, The New York Times reported on how Miller and Robert Law, chief of the Office of Policy and Strategy for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), drafted President Trump’s executive order blocking the issuance of new green cards.”
“The administration cited the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the newest executive order,” SPLC continued. Lies: Miller had long been itching for a public health crisis as a pretext to implement more of his racist agenda, The New York Times reported in May. He got what he desperately wished for in COVID-19—and the fact that Black and Latino communities are being disproportionately hit by the pandemic is probably a plus to him. (Side note: his wife, Mike Pence aide Katie Miller, has also tested positive for COVID-19.)
Democrats from both the House and Senate have long called on Trump to fire Miller, but their shared hatred and contempt for immigrants regardless of legal status and people of color is a main reason why he’s one of the few Trump officials to have lasted these three and a half years. Now, we’ve been stuck subsidizing this one man hate parade.  Remember, November isn’t just about ousting Trump, it’s also about ousting his destructive aide in order to begin the long road to reversing these destructive policies.

As the nation mourns civil rights icon John Lewis, a congressman and lifelong advocate of voting rights, the mayhem in his home state’s most recent election serves as another egregious example of how a citizen’s most sacred act in a democracy – voting – was undermined and even denied after a federal law protecting voters’ rights was abandoned by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling.
Georgia’s presidential primary election on June 9 was a nightmare mix of inefficiency and discrimination that shows how difficult it is for many Americans – particularly Black Americans – to participate in their democracy.
Hundreds of voters, many in majority Black areas, waited four, five and even seven hours to cast their ballots. Some even faced down police seeking to send them home without having voted.
I am a scholar who studies voting rights and voter suppression. When I spoke to longtime Georgia voters throughout the day, each one of them remarked that they “had never seen an election like this in the state of Georgia.”
The state’s primary was an example of what should not happen in a democratic country. It is an experience that has implications beyond Georgia, and that carries warnings for problems with the November presidential election and the legitimacy of the results.
5 hours and 37 minutes after polls should’ve closed, the last voter cast a ballot in Georgia and the police were called on us. Seven police cars were called because black voters refused to let their voices be silenced.
This is why we march and why we vote. https://t.co/nlwWfm0uEH
— Nikema Williams (@DPGChair) June 10, 2020
Not enough places, ballots or help
Georgia’s primary election was postponed twice from its original March 24 date, because of fears of spreading the coronavirus pandemic through in-person voting.
A million and a half Georgians applied to get absentee ballots that would have let them vote by mail. But an unknown number of them never received their ballots and were forced to vote in person to ensure that their votes would be counted. Ultimately only 943,000 ballots were cast by mail.
Georgians didn’t always know where to go to vote: 10% of polling places – including 80 in the state’s most populous county alone – were closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The state-run website that let voters look up where they should vote was down for several hours in the morning and worked only intermittently throughout the day. When the site was up and running, some voters still could not find their correct polling locations and visited precincts where poll workers told them they couldn’t vote.
Experienced poll workers were ill or feared getting sick, so the state had to recruit, train and dispatch new ones right before the election. Many poll workers were insufficiently trained and uninformed, especially about when voters were entitled to absentee, emergency and provisional ballots.
There weren’t enough polling places, either. Several sites that normally serve 2,000 to 3,000 voters had to accommodate as many as 10,000 because of the consolidation.
[Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend. Sign up for our weekly newsletter.]
Some polling places, especially in majority Black areas, had major delays because new voting machines weren’t working correctly. Many polling places across the state opened two and three hours late. The new systems, including printers, scanners and tablets, had trouble throughout the day, causing additional delays.
Precincts ran out of provisional ballots and envelopes and printer paper. County governments, the NAACP and other civil-rights groups appealed to county courts to get orders extending polling hours beyond the usual 7 p.m. to make up for the delays. One precinct didn’t close until 10:10 p.m.
As if that weren’t enough, it rained on voters in long lines with no shelter.
A pattern of vote suppression
Early in the day, Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, blamed the mayhem on the counties, which administer the election, for not properly preparing for the state’s new electronic voting system. County officials responded that the state was the problem.
The state’s Republican leadership did nothing to prevent this democratic disaster from happening, even though it had happened before, just two years ago.
In the 2018 election, Republican Brian Kemp, then Georgia’s secretary of state, was running for governor. As the state’s chief election officer, since 2017 he prepared for the election by using a variety of voter-suppression tactics that could influence the results.
In 2017 Kemp purged more than half a million voters from the rolls under the state’s rule that voters who have not voted in two or more previous elections could be required to re-register before voting again. And he applied another rule that disqualified voters whose names in election rolls did not exactly match their identification documents.
In addition, for the 2018 election, Georgia had fewer polling places open than usual, reduced the availability of early voting and required proof of citizenship before a person could register to vote.
Kemp’s efforts paid off. He won the election against Democrat Stacey Abrams by a nose in the closest governor’s race since 1966.
That narrow victory may have reinforced Georgia Republicans’ fear, shared by President Donald Trump, that if it’s easier for people to vote, the GOP will lose more elections nationwide.
The end of federal supervision
All these manipulations and changes are legal. That’s because in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, removing the provision that protected people’s right to vote free from discrimination.
In their 5-4 Shelby County v. Holder decision, the justices removed the federal government’s power to evaluate, preapprove or block discriminatory voting laws in states like Georgia that have long histories of voter discrimination. That means there is no more federal oversight to ensure that qualified voters can gain access to the polls, and no recourse beyond state governments for voters who fear they have been unfairly denied their rights to vote.
In Georgia and other Republican-led states, officials have used the freedom provided by the Shelby decision to take official actions that make it harder for Americans to vote, and more likely that future elections will look like Georgia’s did on June 9.
Despite all those barriers, though, Democratic voters and Black Georgians turned out in record numbers last month. Enough of them waited, and cast their ballots, to surpass the 1.06 million votes cast in the 2008 primary when Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton.
Whatever the reason for such large numbers overcoming such significant obstacles, it is thanks to the determination of countless individual voters – and not state or county election officials – that Georgians were able to vote in meaningful numbers.
With the Voting Rights Act gutted, other states may feel freer to suppress their citizens’ voting rights the way Georgia did. Voters across the nation may face similar circumstances in their communities – but there is still time for them to demand better from their officials.

0,2020-07-23T00:02:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/swedens-sobering-coronavirus-death-toll-bodes-ill-for-the-right-wings-favorite-approach/,Sweden’s sobering coronavirus death toll bodes ill for the right wing’s favorite approach,"Public health officials in Sweden projected that anywhere from 1,100 to 4,400 more coronavirus-related deaths are to be expected in their country. The death projections are likely a consequence of the Scandinavian nation’s controversial hands-off response to the pandemic, one which many right-leaning Americans have sought to emulate.
State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell from the country’s Public Health Agency told reporters on Tuesday that the most likely scenario is that there will be clusters of new cases which will quickly subside. He added, “we’ve seen [this increase in cases] now in different parts of the world, and which seems like something that COVID-19 is creating more than most other diseases.” He also claimed that “in Sweden, the positive trend with a fairly quick decline in cases continues.”
The report itself laid out several possible scenarios for the coronavirus’ path through Sweden. If the virus continues to spread in accordance with current trends, the report projects that only 1,100 more people will die. If there is a brief spike due to people abandoning safety procedures and then resuming them, the death toll is expected to increase by roughly 3,250. If COVID-19 follows a traditional pandemic trajectory, more than 4,400 deaths related to the virus may occur.
Sweden’s death toll is already the highest in Scandinavia. Since the outbreak there have been 5,667 reported deaths out of 78,504 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. By contrast Denmark has only had 611 reported deaths out of 13,554 confirmed cases, Norway has 255 deaths out of 9,059 confirmed cases and Iceland has 10 deaths out of 1,840 confirmed cases. Sweden has a population of 10.2 million people compared to 5.5 million for Norway, 5.9 million for Denmark and 350,000 for Iceland.
Infamously, Tegnell denied that wearing face masks would make a difference, stating that there was “little scientific evidence” that masks would do anything. That is untrue, and contradicts the scientific consensus on face masks as a preventative public health measure.
Tegnell defended himself last month when confronted about Sweden’s death toll, telling the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter that Sweden’s Public Health Agency “didn’t know that there would be such a big potential for the disease to spread in elderly care homes, with so many deaths” and that “we knew that group was very fragile and that we would get a lot of deaths if they got infected. But we didn’t know that the disease would enter so easily and for the spread to be so big.”
Despite these sobering facts, Tegnell insisted that the social distancing recommendations “worked well,” that he did not believe Sweden should have done things “completely” differently and that “if we were to encounter the same disease, given exactly what we know about it today, I think we would reach a conclusion to act somewhere in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world did.”
Indeed, Sweden has not enacted as many public health restrictions as most other European countries, including not mandating face masks despite the World Health Organization’s recommendation and evidence that masks can effectively reduce transmission of the virus. The country has urged citizens to work from home if possible, for individuals above 70 to stay at home and to avoid unnecessary travel, as well as to practice social distancing. The country did also close universities and ban gatherings of more than 50 people.
Sweden has become something of a rallying cry for conservatives who oppose the economic shutdown and other measures that have been taken to address the pandemic. Sweden decided not to issue stay-at-home orders or forcibly close businesses like restaurants and cafes. It has kept open schools for children under the age of 16 and has only recommended masks for healthcare personnel. As Professor Olle Kampe, a senior consultant in endocrinology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, told Business Insider in May, “We are sacrificing old people and people with diseases, so I don’t [think] that it’s something that anyone should copy.”

Mother Jones reports that two whistleblowers from Richwood Correctional Center in Louisiana shared their experiences, including being told to lower temperatures to hide whether or not a detainee was sick prior to them being deported.
Under ICE policy, detainees with temperatures higher than 99 degrees cannot be deported, a whistleblower at the Richwood Correctional Center identified only as Smith for fear of retaliation told Mother Jones. Smith recalled an incident at an airport when the temperatures of some immigration detainees who were to be deported reached up to 103 degrees. Smith was allegedly instructed to lower the air conditioning to “freeze them out” and enable the immigrants to pass temperature checks to get on the plane.
Mother Jones spoke to Smith and another whistleblower identified as Jones after the Government Accountability Project (GAP), an organization protecting the two government employees, submitted a letter to Congress. “If anyone was to say or do anything, they knew that they were automatically putting their job in jeopardy,” Smith said, recalling other incidents of inhumane tactics used by ICE. Jones added that many colleagues did not want to speak out because working for the agency was their only source of family income.
According to Smith, Richwood’s warden would discipline Smith when detainees did not pass pre-deportation temperature checks because aborted deportations were not only expensive but required additional paperwork. Jones added that the facility wrote key terms, such as “asymptomatic” on detainee medical records to ensure those with low-grade fevers could be deported. “That was the key term,” Jones said. “It was a loophole to get these guys out of the country.”
Like many other ICE detention centers, the Richwood Correctional Center is run by a private prison company, LaSalle Corrections. Jones shared that at least 65 individuals tested positive for COVID-19 after management ignored the severity of the virus in addition to ignoring regulations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to the GAP’s letter to Congress, a medical official at the facility told employees in March that the virus was similar to the flu and that if they hadn’t had the flu shot, they could not demand extra protection.
LaSalle not only intentionally failed to provide personal protective equipment to both staff and detainees, but even banned the use of such equipment for several weeks while intaking COVID-19 patients, the whistleblowers said. Jones noted that it wasn’t until after the Associated Press asked about the mask ban that some employees were able to wear masks. Detainees still lacked basic hygiene and masks.
Additionally, LaSalle mixed detainees exposed to COVID-19 with “healthy detainees and staff during transport on a regular basis,” according to the GAP. While ignoring CDC guidelines, LaSalle quarantined individuals with preexisting conditions and a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus, such as those with tuberculosis, with COVID-19 patients.
Neglecting basic hygiene and ignoring CDC health guidelines wasn’t the end of it. The facility allegedly concealed information regarding infections and required some employees to work while waiting for COVID-19 test results. Those employees who were unwilling to risk COVID-19 exposure were told to use personal leave time or go without pay, the GAP stated.
As of Tuesday, ICE’s database of confirmed COVID-19 cases lists 926 active cases in custody. According to the database, 16,503 of 22,142 detainees have been tested. More than 3,700 ICE detainees are listed as having tested positive for the coronavirus, but the agency has still failed to provide the number of individuals who have been hospitalized. According to Mother Jones, the federal agency reported no active cases at Richwood for most of July, claiming that all 65 of those who tested positive either recovered or were no longer in custody. On Friday, ICE reported two cases, followed by two more on Monday. All four of those are still active. ICE has not only failed to provide the number of those hospitalized, but it continues to deceive the public in reporting its number of active cases.
Smith told Mother Jones that at least five detainees from Richmond were taken to the hospital on April 22 alone, many of whom were hospitalized for weeks without contact with family members. Smith was told not to allow detainees to use the phone because LaSalle management was worried recordings would be shared with the media. In another incident, Smith recalled being told to return a detainee, who had just been tested and found to be positive, to a dorm full of people without COVID-19 because the warden believed the test result was a “false positive.”
As Smith noted, the agency has deported immigrants with temperatures higher than 100 degrees–meaning of those deported, some may have been carrying the coronavirus. Once released from detention, immigrants who test positive are no longer considered to be in ICE custody and are therefore do not require the agency to report that case. Since the start of the pandemic ICE has deported thousands of immigrants, many of whom tested positive after arriving in their home countries, CBS News reported.
In response to the letter to Congress and allegations made by the whistleblowers, ICE spokesperson Bryan Cox told Mother Jones that “anonymous, unsubstantiated allegations should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve.” LaSalle executive Scott Sutterfield also issued a statement to the news outlet claiming the allegations to be both “false” and “misleading,” adding that staff works to protect those in their care and that it is “very disappointing that anonymous sources would attempt to distort these hero’s [sic] efforts.”
According to The News Star, in April two Richwood guards died after testing positive for COVID-19. The guards’ families told local news outlets they wanted an investigation into the prison company’s response to the pandemic. While LaSalle issued testimony claiming to have followed measures to prevent the spread of the virus, it made no mention of deaths.
ICE facilities nationwide have shown evidence of inhumane conditions and negligence towards basic healthcare needs such as protective equipment and other hygiene products. The agency continues to perpetuate disgusting tactics to advance its xenophobic policies, such as transferring and deporting immigrants amid a pandemic, increasing the risk of spreading COVID-19.
Enough is enough—ICE must be abolished.

“The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals service, and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime,” the president said during prepared remarks at the White House.

Trump and Barr both tied rises in violent crime in U.S. cities to recent protests for Black lives and against police brutality that erupted after the police killing of George Floyd in May. Neither man provided any evidence to back up those claims.
AG Barr, like Trump before him, links the recent rise in violent crime in some cities to recent protests against police + calls for defunding, calling the increasing violence “a direct result” of it. He offers no evidence, nor does he say why some crimes are up and others down

The deployment announcement was largely panned by critics, who called the effort another sign of Trump’s authoritarian approach to the presidency.
“In case you were wondering, this is precisely what fascism looks like,” tweeted Los Angeles Times columnist David Lazarus.The deployment announcement was largely panned by critics, who called the effort another sign of Trump’s authoritarian approach to the presidency.

New: Trump announces that Justice Department will surge “hundreds” of officers from FBI, ATF, DEA, US Marshals and DHS to Chicago to deal with “violent crime” as part of Justice Department’s new Operation Legend (named after 4-year-old boy shot in Kansas City)
— Evan Hill (@evanchill) July 22, 2020
During Wednesday’s press conference on the expansion of the “Operation Legend” program, which began in Kansas City, Barr and acting secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf sought to distinguish the program from the ongoing clashes between DHS agents and protesters in Portland, Oregon.
But those assurances will have to do a lot to overcome the skepticism of local officials, especially as the number of agents expected to be deployed under the program is still unclear.
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot warned on Tuesday that a Portland-style federal deployment would only make unrest in the city worse.
“What I understand at this point—and I caveat that—is that the Trump administration is not going to foolishly deploy unnamed agents to the streets of Chicago,” said Lightfoot.
According to the Associated Press:
DHS officers have already been dispatched to Portland, Oregon, and other localities to protect federal property and monuments as Trump has lambasted efforts by protesters to knock down Confederate statutes. Trump has linked the growing violence in the streets with protests over racial injustice, though criminal justice experts say the spike defies easy explanation, pointing to the unprecedented moment the country is living through—with a pandemic that has killed more than 140,000 Americans, historic unemployment, stay-at-home orders, a mass reckoning over race and police brutality, intense stress and even the weather.
Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) on Wednesday led 116 of his colleagues in a letter (pdf) demanding Barr and Wolf answer their questions on the ongoing Portland deployment and any planned expansion of federal law enforcement programs in U.S. cities.
“This is not legitimate law enforcement under our Constitution but a shocking slide into authoritarianism and police state tactics,” the letter reads, adding that “these new tactics are an outrageous assault on the liberties of the people and the police powers and political sovereignty of the states.”
Trump and Barr’s announcement follows over a week of speculation that federal agents would enter U.S. cities despite local resistance.
Former DHS spokesperson David Lapan told Politico Tuesday that he fears the ramifications of the president’s new move to use federal agents for domestic law enforcement.
“It’s overly militaristic, it’s being seen in partisan political terms, and it’s usurping the authorities of the local law enforcement and elected officials,” said Lapan.
Advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) tweeted that the DOJ’s use of federal agents for Trump’s political goals was a clear reason to impeach the attorney general.
“Turning federal forces against racial justice protestors is what abuse of power looks like,” CREW said. “Congress should waste no time in impeaching AG Barr before he goes further in carrying out President Trump’s racist agenda.”

And it’s no surprise — the economy is collapsing and the country is ravaged by a devastating pandemic, events that President Donald Trump is in no small part to blame for.
But the stress of impending doom isn’t focusing GOP minds or encouraging them to band together. Instead, the pressure seems to be tearing them apart. And in their dysfunction, they may be ready to thwart the country’s best chances of muddling through the present devastation further undermining their own electoral standing heading into November.
Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) has been the subject of much internal scrutiny and discord, as multiple reports and public comments have revealed. Though at times she has sought the president’s favor, she broken with him at key points recently — inspiring the wrath of his fierce congressional defenders.
CNN reported that she became a target at Tuesday’s Republican conference:
Several House Republicans attacked House GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming during a conference meeting Tuesday morning for supporting Dr. Anthony Fauci and splitting with President Donald Trump on a variety of issues over the past few months, three sources who were in the room told CNN.
Members including Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Chip Roy of Texas, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Ralph Norman of South Carolina all chimed in to air grievances against Cheney.
…
During the conference meeting, Gaetz and Massie complained about Cheney supporting a primary challenge to Massie, the sources said. Jordan, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, listed areas where Cheney has publicly disagreed with the President, pointing to her resistance to Trump’s plan to pull back troops in Germany and Afghanistan.
Roy hit Cheney for supporting Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, and complained that his Democratic opponent has retweeted some of Cheney’s tweets.
But the acrimony also spilled over into public:
We already have one Mitt Romney, we don’t need another… we also don’t need the endless wars she advocates for. https://t.co/RDkJDA9UOZ
— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 21, 2020
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), too, let loose on Cheney to the media.
“I mean she tries to sabotage everything he tries to do in foreign policy, so I don’t know whether she’s a good advocate for the President or not,” he told CNN.
He also said: “I don’t think she’s good for the country.”
Meanwhile, rifts are forming over what to do with the next coronavirus relief bill. On that matter, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) have found themselves on opposite sides.
The Washington Post’s James Hohmann reported that Cruz fumed at Cotton’s advocacy for more spending at a recent meeting, exclaiming: “What in the hell are we doing?”
According to Axios, the primary rift falls between Senate Republicans and the Trump White House.
“The Senate Republican lunch descended into chaos, several GOP lawmakers said, revealing that the White House and Republican senators remain far apart on key priorities in the next economic package,” reported Alayna Treene. “The White House officials did little talking, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told reporters. Instead, senators used the time to air their disagreements. ‘There’s a robust difference of opinion,’ Hawley said.”
Once again, Paul aired his frustrations publicly:
Just came from Progressive Democrat, whoops, I’m mean Republican caucus:
They’re going to spend $105b more on education, more than we spend every year on the Dept of Education. Anyone remember when Reagan conservatives were for eliminating the Federal Dept. of Education?
— Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) July 21, 2020
Democrats, on the other hand, remain united. The House passed a $3 trillion spending bill in May that the Senate and the White House have refused to move on.
“Republicans are in complete disarray,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), according to the Washington Post. “Totally incompetent. Totally in disarray. Totally at war with one another.”
CNBC reported Wednesday afternoon that the GOP is drifting toward potentially passing a bill that would extend the expanded unemployment insurance in the country after it is supposed to expire this week — but at a drastically reduced rate:
Republicans are considering extending the enhanced unemployment insurance benefit at a dramatically reduced level of $400 per month, or $100 a week, through the rest of the year, sources told CNBC.
Congress passed a $600 per week, or $2,400 a month, boost to jobless benefits in March to deal with a wave of unemployment unseen in decades as states shut down their economies to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The policy expires at the end of July as the U.S. unemployment rate stands above 11%, despite two strong months of job growth.
The GOP, which has not made a final decision on how it will craft unemployment insurance in a bill set to be released this week, previously discussed extending the benefit at an additional $200 per week instead of $600. Democrats want to make the $600 per week sum available at least until next year.
This plan, it should be clear, would be disastrous. There are still many millions of people unemployed because of the initial downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many are desperate and only scraping by as is. Slashing their benefits by $2,000 a month, with the virus resurgent and the economy at risk of getting worse, would be a brutal blow.
Even if Republicans were to eventually agree with Democrats and extend the $600 a week expanded unemployment (an unlikely scenario), observers expect the program will still lapse before it is renewed. This means recipients would face a gap in the payments they’ve been receiving, which could itself cause a major shock to the economy.
And all this rancor, dithering, and lack of urgency are likely to be electoral poison for the GOP. With a devastated economy and an out-of-control virus, the ruling party is likely to lose the White House and congressional seats no matter what it does. But guaranteeing economic distress and continued uncertainty for millions of families while the country is trying to recover from financial collapse would be a spectacular form of Republican self-sabotage.

But that doesn’t mean that Trump is practicing what he preached. According to Washington Post reporters Fenit Nirappil and Julie Zauzmer, Trump’s “apparent defiance of D.C. coronavirus regulations” earlier this week “has caught the attention of local authorities.”
Trump, Nirappil and Zauzmer report, “did not wear a mask while greeting a congressional candidate holding a Monday fundraiser at his downtown Washington hotel, according to video of the event. Nor did multiple guests while they were standing near each other in the lobby, the video shows.”

This, according to the Post journalists, is a blatant violation of the social distancing rules that D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser announced in the spring. She ordered D.C. residents to cover their faces in hotels and maintain a distance of at least six feet from others.
John Falcicchio, Bowser’s chief of staff, told the Post he was aware of reports that Trump and others weren’t wearing masks in the hotel and said, “We’ll send it to our agencies. They’ll look into it.”
Nirappil and Zauzmer note: “Despite overwhelming support for masks from public health experts, the coverings have become a political litmus tests of sorts, with many Republicans eschewing them. As virus cases have spiked in the southern and western United States, however, a growing number of Republican elected officials have taken to wearing face coverings and calling them necessary.”
The reporters observe that Trump “has softened his long-standing resistance and hostility to the use of masks to reduce coronavirus transmission,” and on Monday, he even “tweeted a photo of himself wearing a mask and called it patriotic — hours before he showed up at his hotel without one.”
We are United in our effort to defeat the Invisible China Virus, and many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can’t socially distance. There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favorite President! pic.twitter.com /iQOd1whktN

But Daniel W. Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts University in Massachusetts, contemplates Trump’s possible political motivations in an op-ed published this week in the Washington Post.
“The official version is that federal officers from the Department of Homeland Security are protecting federal buildings that have been the focus of Black Lives Matter protests,” Drezner explains. “The more disturbing version is that unidentified U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel are wearing camouflage gear, assaulting protesters and driving around in unmarked vans picking up random people. These actions have raised questions about the legality of what is being done…. I’ll confine my response to a more concrete question: what is the political gain that Donald Trump and his administration perceive they will garner from these actions?”
Drezner is dismissive of Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf’s claim that Trump is merely using DHS to protect Portland from “violent anarchists.”
“This is not actually about anarchy in Portland because the city seems both ordered and copacetic with what’s happening,” Drezner argues. “This is about something else. What political gain does Trump see from escalating and nationalizing this situation?”
Drezner goes on to say that Trump is motivated by either “incompetence” or “malevolence,” although he isn’t sure which one and finds the latter to be the more frightening possibility.
If it’s “incompetence,” Drezner argues, Trump has made a political miscalculation because he fails to realize that that using DHS officers against protesters is only giving his detractors yet another reason to vote for former Vice President Joe Biden, this year’s presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
“It is possible that Trump mistakenly believes that this is a winning political move,” Drezner writes. “But there is another, darker possibility. As 2020 has progressed, two things have become increasingly clear: (1) Donald Trump is losing the presidential race to Joe Biden. (2) Trump is doing everything in his power to consolidate and expand his power over the executive branch. From loyalty tests to D-list appointments to his attraction to legally dubious executive orders, Trump has tried to surmount his fundamental weakness as a political leader and augment the awesome powers of the presidency.”
Drezner writes that although he isn’t sure, he is inclined to see “incompetence” as the president’s motivation with DHS and the Portland protesters — quickly adding that if he is wrong, that possibility “scares the bejeezus out of me.”
“With Trump, I tend to choose incompetence over malevolence in explaining his actions,” Drezner writes. “It is likely that he thinks this will be a winning political move, even if it is not. This is one of those instances, however, in which one should absolutely be prepared for malevolence. Democrats in Congress, the Biden campaign, the courts, the governors, civil society organizations, and even the U.S. military need to start preparing for the contingency of an immature president who refuses to leave the office. Because this is all too plausible an explanation for why Trump and his toadies are doing what they are doing right now.”

0,2020-07-22T19:50:27+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/new-methane-leak-found-in-antarctica-raises-alarm-as-planet-edges-closer-to-climate-tipping-points/,New methane leak found in Antarctica raises alarm as planet edges closer to climate tipping points,"Scientists have for the first time identified an active leak of methane gas from the sea floor in Antarctica, increasing the possibility that the planet is close to one of the “tipping points” that would put the impacts of global heating out of humans’ control.
According to The Guardian, researchers led by Andrew Thurber at Oregon State University found the methane leak in a region known as Cinder Cones in McMurdo Sound, within the Ross Sea. The site is 30 feet below the surface of the ocean.
In addition to finding methane dissolved in the water there, the scientists found that microbes which usually consume the gas before it reaches the atmosphere had only formed in small numbers five years after they first began to study the site.
Thurber called the findings “incredibly concerning.”
“It is not good news. It took more than five years for the microbes to begin to show up and even then there was still methane rapidly escaping from the sea floor,” he told The Guardian. “The methane cycle is absolutely something that we as a society need to be concerned about.”
Scientists have warned for years that the climate crisis could lead to the “tipping point” of methane leaks in the sea floor and the thawing of permafrost regions.
“At some point in a warming world, greenhouse gas emissions from nature will go way beyond anything we can control,” tweeted Australian immunologist Peter Doherty.
At some point in a warming world greenhouse gas emissions from nature will go way beyond anything we can control. Only strategy then will be to use technology for removal from the atmosphere. First active leak of sea-bed methane discovered in Antarctica https://t.co/4Y88iR2hyk
— Prof. Peter Doherty (@ProfPCDoherty) July 22, 2020
The Ross Sea has not yet warmed significantly from the climate crisis, so the research did not directly link the methane leak to global heating.
But climate models have not yet accounted for significant delays in the development of microbes, which help to keep methane from leaking into the atmosphere.
“The big question is: how large is the lag [in microbe development] compared with the speed at which new leaks of methane might potentially form in the wake of retreating ice?” Prof. Jemma Wadham of the University of Bristol in the UK, who reviewed the study, told The Guardian.
Thurber called the discovery of the methane leak and the delayed microbe growth “a significant discovery that can help fill a large hole in our understanding of the methane cycle.”
“Methane is the second-most effective gas at warming our atmosphere and the Antarctic has vast reservoirs that are likely to open up as ice sheets retreat due to climate change,” he said in a statement.
Other tipping points identified by climate scientists include the disintegration of the ice sheet in West Antarctica, “dieback” in the Amazon which would transform the rainforest into a dry ecosystem, and the dying off of the coral reefs.
Scientists raised alarm earlier this year about unusually warm water beneath a massive glacier in West Antarctica, and researchers warned in February that the third major bleaching event in five years at the Great Barrier Reef would put the reef “on a knife edge.”

0,2020-07-22T19:19:36+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/even-republicans-are-warning-trumps-dhs-is-turning-into-the-presidents-personal-militia/,Even Republicans are warning Trump’s DHS is turning into ‘the president’s personal militia’,"President Donald Trump gave Democrats yet another reason to oppose his reelection when he bragged about using federal law enforcement officers against George Floyd protesters in Portland, Oregon and threatened to do the same thing in Chicago and other major cities with Democratic mayors. But some Republicans have been speaking out as well, and liberal Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent discusses their objections in his column this week.
“Under fire for dispatching federal law enforcement into cities in defiance of local leaders, in part to create TV imagery that sends an authoritarian thrill up President Trump’s leg, top officials are offering several new defenses,” Sargent writes. “All are profoundly weak, which is why senior members of previous Republican administrations are now condemning what’s happening.”
One of those Republicans is Michael Chertoff, who served as secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush. Chertoff, Sargent notes, has described Trump’s use of DHS officers as “very problematic” and “very unsettling.”
Chertoff told Sargent, “In my view, this is damaging to the (Homeland Security) Department. It undermines the credibility of the Department’s principal mission.”
Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf has vigorously defended Trump’s actions, arguing that DHS has a right to protect federal property such as the federal building in Portland. But Chertoff finds Wolf’s arguments unconvincing.
The former Bush-era DHS secretary told Sargent: “While it’s appropriate for DHS to protect federal property, that is not an excuse to range more widely in a city and to conduct police operations — particularly if local authorities have not requested federal assistance. That’s our constitutional system.”
Trump’s desire to send DHS officers to patrol U.S. cities whether governors and mayors want them there or not, according to Chertoff, is “very problematic legally as well as morally.”
“Essentially, he’s suggesting this is a political maneuver,” Chertoff told Sargent. “As someone who’s spent four years at the department, the idea that people would be suggesting that it’s going to be a tool of political activity is very unsettling.”
Another Bush-era Republican who is speaking out against Trump is Tom Ridge, who served two terms as governor of Pennsylvania before becoming DHS secretary under President Bush in the early 2000s. Interviewed by CNN’s Michael Smerconish, Ridge stressed that DHS was created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to protect the U.S. against “global terrorism” and was “not established to be the president’s personal militia.”
“It would be a cold day in hell before I would consent to a unilateral, uninvited intervention into one of my cities,” Ridge told Smerconish.
Sargent wraps up his column by stressing that “acting’ is the keyword where Wolf is concerned. Unlike a permanent DHS secretary, Wolf has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
“The lack of Senate confirmation is the key there,” Sargent explains. “As (writers) Nick Miroff and Matt Zapotosky point out, it’s no accident that unconfirmed officials like Wolf ‘appear almost daily on cable television to praise Trump’s resolve.’ That’s what Trump wants them to do. But the growing roar of criticism from the other direction may render this new push impossible to sustain.”

0,2020-07-22T19:09:04+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-media-is-getting-duped-by-trump-again-hes-the-same-disturbed-man-he-always-was/,The media is getting duped by Trump again — he’s the same disturbed man he always was,"First things first: Donald Trump is not going to “pivot.” Yes, on Tuesday he stood at a podium and, in stiff and sulky fashion, said words that, as written, were relatively serious and realistic. He admitted the coronavirus pandemic will “get worse before it gets better.” He also claimed that his administration is “developing a strategy” to combat the pandemic, after months of foisting it off on the states and then lambasting any state that tried to take serious measures, while rewarding governors who pushed to reopen businesses and damn the consequences. He said he’d wear a mask now, after months of implying that only soy-boys and wieners wear masks.
These are all words that Trump said. But they don’t mean anything. As Dan Rather sagely observed on Twitter, Trump “does not pivot” and whatever temporary behavior we see on display, he will always, always, always revert to being “who he is, and always has been,” which is to say a rancid monster with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
Unfortunately, much of the media coverage gave an entirely different impression, presenting Trump’s performance at Tuesday’s press briefing as if it represented a real shift, and seeding the absolutely false hope that Trump might actually start doing something to fight the coronavirus, instead of acting like the coronavirus’s biggest champion.
“Trump, in a Shift, Endorses Masks and Says Virus Will Get Worse,” reads the headline at the New York Times.
“Pandemic likely to ‘get worse before it gets better,’ Trump says in somber return to coronavirus briefing,” the Washington Post headline read.
“Trump changes course as COVID-19 response faces critical tests,” claims an ABC News analysis.
The Reuters tweet on the press conference declared, “President Trump, in a shift in rhetoric and tone, encouraged Americans to wear masks.”
White House staff, eager to push this “pivot” narrative, ran to CNN and anonymously assured reporters that Trump has “relented” and they have successfully “linked wearing a mask to political success.”
We’ve been down this road dozens of times before: Trump, facing bad press, sucks it up and, with the posture of a kid being dragged to the dentist, feigns being presidential for a few minutes. Then, with the predictability of a clock, he gets sick of all this “acting respectable” nonsense and goes right back to his preferred mode: vitriol, incompetence and asserting that everything is “great” no matter how bad it gets.
We’ve even been through this cycle with the coronavirus pandemic. In late March and early April, the press fell all over praising Trump for his “new tone” and for being “grave, sober, grim, realistic” in the face of the fast-rising caseload.
Trump’s sober-mindedness was as brief as a mosquito’s mating season, however, and by the middle of April, he was encouraging protests against coronavirus precautions, demanding that Democratic governors and legislators “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” and “LIBERATE VIRGINIA” and so on. He heavily and successfully pressured red-state governors to reopen prematurely and without much of a plan — which is the primary reason for our nationwide soaring coronavirus rates — and justified it with false claims that hydroxychloroquine was some kind of miracle cure, which it definitely is not.
Three weeks after Trump’s former “new tone,” he went on TV during one of his so-called briefings and suggested that injecting household disinfectants into people’s lungs was a possible miracle cure for COVID-19, and that maybe actual medical researchers weren’t smart enough to have thought of it yet, unlike his good-brained self. The result was widespread mockery and Trump, his ego bruised, ended the coronavirus briefings and dove ever deeper into conspiracy theories that the whole thing is a hoax invented by liberals to hurt his re-election chances. So that’s how that “pivot” ended.
Indeed, there’s no reason to think that Trump’s words on Tuesday will be reflected in anything resembling action. Despite his claims that there’s a new “strategy” in development, the White House has actually been trying to defund the already-failing coronavirus testing system and force hospitals to report cases to a mysterious data collection service within the Department of Health and Human Services, instead of directly to the CDC. The purpose of all this, of course, is to hide the numbers and hope that tricks the public into thinking Trump has the coronavirus problem licked. (Or that it never existed in the first place. Whichever!)
It’s no mystery what’s going on here: Trump demoted campaign manager Brad Parscale last week and hired a new one, former White House political director Bill Stepien. As often happens with the revolving door in TrumpWorld, new hires try to rein Trump in a little, coaxing him to pretend to be a normal human being who experiences emotions like empathy and concern for others. The act never lasts. Trump always lashes out shortly after one of these “pivots,” often saying something especially odious, a man gleefully throwing off the shackles of having to pretend to have any pro-social impulses at all.
This is, after all, the Donald Trump whose father used to tell reporters, “Donald is the smartest person I know” and that “everything he touches seems to turn to gold.” Trump believed his dear old dad’s hype, and has repeatedly asserted that he is the world’s greatest living expert in every topic under the sun, and that, unlike other experts who know stuff because they learned it, he sprung into the world knowing everything about everything and has nothing to learn from anyone.
So it’s just a matter of time until Trump, whose weary tone Tuesday made clear he was feeling restrained, decides he knows better than all these “experts” about what the public wants to hear, and goes straight back to his comfort zone: Conspiracy theories about the coronavirus and ridiculously out-of-touch claims about how well the administration is doing and how everything is “great” and “perfect” and “brilliant.”
Remember, it was literally just last weekend that Trump, using the same kinds of lies he used for years to mislead real estate investors, told Chris Wallace of Fox News that the U.S. has “one of the lowest mortality rates in the world” (it’s actually among the highest), that our death rate is going down (it’s been climbing for several weeks and just reached 1,000 a day), and that he was right to claim, as he did over and over again throughout the spring, that the virus would just “disappear” one day (needless to say, that’s not how this works).
Whatever Trump’s aides wrote on a piece of paper and had him read out loud is not what Trump wants to say — and he is incapable of keeping his feelings to himself, due to his addiction to attention and his absolute certainty that he knows better than everyone else. And what Trump really wants to say is not a mystery: Real men don’t wear masks, the virus is being overhyped as a plot against him, and he can bamboozle people into believing everything is fine simply by declaring it so.
Indeed, the shape of the press conference showed that Trump’s aides know he can only be contained for short periods of time. The briefing was tightly constrained and Trump stuck to written statements. He started to take questions, and pretty quickly the real Trump peeked out. He was asked about Ghislaine Maxwell — the former partner of his old buddy Jeffrey Epstein — who was recently been arrested for her alleged role in child sex trafficking. He responded, “I wish her well, frankly.”
A few minutes later, Trump, likely realizing his aides might be annoyed with that disturbing answer, abruptly wrapped up the press conference. Most likely he’d been told to cut it short and not open himself up to the inevitable humiliation of talking off the cuff, and, as he does when he’s trying to “pivot,” he took the advice for a moment.
To be fair, many of the articles under those headlines trumpeting Trump’s “shift” noted, several paragraphs down, that Trump has tried to pivot before, and always regresses to his usual self. But that sort of nuance gets lost in a world where most news consumers rarely read past the first few paragraphs and many only scan the headlines.
Perhaps it’s foolish to expect mainstream news outlets to get smarter about how they cover Trump, just as it’s foolish of such journalists to expect Trump to get smarter, listen to his aides and start acting more presidential. But Trump is a deeply disturbed man who likely suffers from a personality disorder that makes growing, learning or changing impossible. Mainstream journalists, whose job is literally to learn things so they can boil down their knowledge for the general public, can and should do better. Listen to Dan Rather. Trump is not going to pivot. He cannot do it. Stop falling for these stunts and focus on reporting the real news.

Here’s what he doesn’t understand,"Can you spot the problem with this question from a Fox News poll?
The latest Fox News survey asks voters how they view the country’s Founders. Sixty-three percent see them as heroes, while 15 percent say villains. Another 15 percent say it depends and 7 percent gave no opinion.
The results allowed Ben Shapiro to go on a bit of a rant, primarily aimed at African Americans.
Ben Shapiro: “If you look at the Black community in the United States, according to this poll, a plurality of Black Americans believe the founders were villains rather than heroes, which is devastating to the future of the country.” pic.twitter.com/F7GzVbNoOo
— Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) July 20, 2020
The problem, of course, lies in the fact that the question only gives respondents two choices about how to describe this country’s founders: hero or villain. For many of us—especially those whose ancestors were held as slaves—the options needed to be more nuanced.
But nuance isn’t something that modern-day Republicans value. For them, the world is divided up into the dichotomies of good and evil, right and wrong, heroes and villains. That is why a quote from Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s book, The Gulag Archipelago, is so powerful.
If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?
When we talk about the divisiveness of Donald Trump and his enablers, it is their constant attempt to label the opposition as “evil” that is at the heart of the problem. Once the evil ones have been identified, the natural progression is to “separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.” The question from the Fox News poll gave Shapiro his target.
Were someone like Shapiro to actually recognize nuance, it would come in the form of the Fredrick Douglass speech that I referred to previously titled, “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?” After describing this country’s founders as both courageous and wise, he made it clear that “This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.” We can be fairly certain that if Douglass were asked that ridiculous poll question from Fox News, he would answer “depends” and find himself on the receiving end of Shaprio’s disdain.
To the extent that the American electorate can recognize the importance of nuance, it is one of the most powerful tools to awaken them from the zero sum game of these dichotomies embraced by Republicans. This is how one white evangelical woman in Texas put it.
Kelsey Hency, who graduated from the conservative Dallas Theological Seminary, talked about how she had adopted a black infant as Mr. Trump swept the Republican primaries and had realized how much she needed to learn about race. “It brought the torrent of everything else…What Trump did was almost give us permission to take back nuance,” she said.
For those who would suggest that asking the American public to recognize nuance is just another form of elitism, I would point out that pretty much any responsible parent knows how important it is to hold a child accountable when they do something wrong. But they also know that bad behavior from their children doesn’t make them evil—it simply means they’re human. And to correct them is a big part of what it means to love them. That kind of awareness is simply common sense.
A few years ago I asked the question, “Is Uncertainty a Liberal Value?”
I’ve come to believe that listening requires a suspension of certainty – at least long enough to hear what the other person is saying and attempt to empathize with where they are coming from. It also requires some curiosity about perspectives different from our own. It is in that spirit that I ask the question: Are things like uncertainty, listening, curiosity and empathy liberal values?
During these days when joining the struggle to “perfect our union” is being vilified as threat to our country, I would suggest that we need to add a recognition of the importance of nuance to that list of liberal values.

0,2020-07-22T18:25:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trump-desperately-needs-help-out-of-his-slump-but-his-old-big-of-tricks-cant-help-him/,Trump desperately needs help out of his slump — but his old bag of tricks won’t work,"Annie Karni of the New York Times reports that the president is bluffing when he says “I’m not losing” to Joe Biden. He knows that he’s down because his own pollsters have been honest with him about it. They apparently feel the need to sugarcoat the situation and reassure him that he’s not to blame, but he’s definitely losing.
So, he’s been solicitous of advice on how to improve his standing, and appears to made a decision to recommend the wearing of masks for purely political reasons.
[Trump’s] internal numbers still show him trailing Mr. Biden, and he is worried about his standing. He asks his advisers with more regularity, “What do we need to do?” and grills his friends about “how is it looking?” while making public course corrections, the advisers said.
Over the past several weeks, he changed his stance on promoting masks, claiming that it was “patriotic” to wear one, and resuscitated the daily coronavirus news conference — both an acknowledgment that he needs to be seen as taking the virus seriously again.
Evidently, he’s also been told that he gives the strong impression that he doesn’t give a shit that more than 130,000 people have died and thousands more are clinging to life in hospitals. This isn’t a good look, and he has to make it clear that he understands what people are going through.
This is cited as the reason he has “resuscitated the daily coronavirus news conference.” But, of course, Trump can’t fake empathy, which was clear in announcement of the resumption:
“I think it’s a great way to get information out to the public as to where we are with the vaccines, with the therapeutics, and, generally speaking, where we are,” Trump told reporters Monday. “I’ll do it at 5 o’clock, like we were doing. We had a good slot. And a lot of people were watching.”
This isn’t new. Back in March, during the first iteration of his nightly coronavirus press conferences, Trump also bragged about his ratings. But eventually those briefings because so glaringly self-injurious from Trump, especially after he recommended people ingest disinfectant, that he was convinced to stop attending them. Then they were cancelled altogether, since the health experts’ information didn’t support the president’s desire to quickly reopen the economy. It’s important to remember that a key reason people were able to persuade Trump to abandon his highly-rated show is that they corresponded with a slump in his polls.
Yet, now he has revived the show sans health care experts in an effort to revive his poll numbers. That seems counterintuitive, but I suppose Trump can’t come up with a better option.
He held his first solo briefing on Tuesday and won some praise for taking a more somber and appropriate tone, but he still spread disinformation, and he actually got the most headline for something completely unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Donald Trump has bestowed his good wishes on Ghislaine Maxwell, who faces federal charges for allegedly enabling the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking of minor girls.
At a press conference ostensibly to discuss the coronavirus crisis gripping the US on Tuesday, Trump took questions from reporters, one of whom asked him about Maxwell’s recent arrest and whether she might implicate some of the “powerful men” who formed part of Epstein’s jet set social circle.
“I don’t know – I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly,” Trump responded. “I have met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is.”
Many people interpreted this as a signal to Ms. Maxwell that she shouldn’t divulge what she knows about the president’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and I’m pretty sure that’s not what the Trump campaign was hoping he would accomplish in the briefing. He seems to only have nice things to say about acquaintances who have been arrested or are under criminal investigation. Well, he’s also fond of Confederate generals, racist sheriffs and war criminals, but he doesn’t have a kind word for anyone else.
You can’t teach an old dog new tricks, and Trump’s new coronavirus briefings are not going to be any more informative, reassuring, or helpful to his poll numbers than the ones he abandoned in the Spring.

0,2020-07-22T17:18:59+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/unemployed-americans-are-on-precipice-of-financial-disaster-if-congress-doesnt-act-now-ex-federal-reserve-official/,Unemployed Americans are on ‘precipice of financial disaster’ if Congress doesn’t act now: ex-Federal Reserve official,"In just three days, expanded unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to millions of people will end. That’s the $600/week boost that has gone to millions of people thrown out of their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic, the boost that Republicans insist is making a lazy workforce refuse to get back on the job, so they’re trying to get rid of it. But those benefits are doing so much more, Joseph Vavra, a University of Chicago economist who has been studying the impact of the benefits, told The New York Times.
“These unemployment benefit checks are really doing a large job in propping up spending by these unemployed households.” If they are allowed to expire “there’s a good chance that what is now an unemployment problem becomes a foreclosure crisis and eviction crisis.” These UI dollars are circulating throughout the economy, to landlords and grocery stores and hardware stores and all sorts of other retailers, keeping them afloat and their employees on the job. That might have sunk in for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and maybe even some Republicans, as they are now, at the last minute considering a side deal to extend the benefits while they worker out a larger stimulus deal.
That deal, Bloomberg reports, “would extend funds that were provided to millions of Americans by earlier coronavirus rescue packages, according to people familiar with the matter.” However, the scope of that is not clear because there are still Republicans who don’t think the millions of people thrown out of work out of no fault of their own deserve the assistance. There’s also some pushback, which is irritating, from at least one House Democrat. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he doesn’t want the short-term extension because he wants “to give people the security they are not going to be let down and fall through the cracks in September and October.” That’s a good point, so they should start negotiating NOW to extend the benefits this week and tie them to economic conditions moving forward. Do what McConnell always does and use an impending crisis to their advantage. That would remove one contentious issue for the larger package as well.
The urgency is very real. “There are people who are on the precipice of financial disaster here,” David Wilcox, a former Federal Reserve official told the Times. “We may think that the odds are that Congress will come to a reasonable conclusion. But for a person who is on the precipice of financial disaster, it’s very low comfort to be told, ‘You know, I think there’s a 70 percent chance that this is going to work out fine.’” It sure as hell isn’t going to work out by next week. In fact, the latest from Politico’s sources is that there is “0% chance there will be a bill passed by the end of July, 40% chance there is a bill by mid-August.” People can’t wait that long.
Neither the White House nor Mitch McConnell’s office commented for the Bloomberg story on the negations, but Mnuchin and Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows are back on Capitol Hill Wednesday. One hint that Mnuchin might be finally taking this seriously is that he met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday afternoon. Every previous major relief bill was negotiated ultimately between Mnuchin and the Democrats, with McConnell shuttled aside because of his continued insistence on only working within his Senate Republican conference. It could be a threat to McConnell from Mnuchin that he’s got to start including Pelosi and Schumer in his negotiations or get sidelined again.
If they’re serious about dealing with this situation, though, they’ll all set whatever posturing they need to do aside to provide for immediate relief to the millions of unemployed who have no clue what’s going to happen to them next week. Like Jacob Perlman, a Chicago resident on unemployment. He made $12 an hour working at a fitness club, and he is anxious to return to work somewhere, but says “The jobs simply are not there right now.” His normal UI benefit is $159 a week. His share of the monthly rent is $500. So if he loses the $600/week boost, he’ll have $136 a month to live on after he pays rent. “I just want security,” he told the Times. “That’s what I want. I’m not looking to profit off this. If there was a job out there, I would take it.”

Ted Cruz of Texas clashed with a fellow Republican, Sen.  Tom Cotton of Arkansas, during a discussion of coronavirus spending and the federal deficit.According to the Washington Post’s James Hohmann, Cotton “suggested” that  “Republicans should be willing to keep racking up debt to maintain power.” But Cruz vehemently disagreed, declaring “What in the hell are we doing?”
Tom Cotton suggested at a private lunch with GOP senators and White House emissaries that Republicans should be willing to keep racking up debt to maintain power.
Ted Cruz, irate about the growing price tag, asked: “What in the hell are we doing?”https://t.co/E1H0h3eUeH
— James Hohmann (@jameshohmann) July 22, 2020
Cotton, Hohmann notes, “argued that the full conference needs to focus on protecting their most vulnerable members. Cotton postulated that Democrats would spend more money if they win the Senate majority in November — and therefore, it is cheaper in the long run to allow the size of the spending package to grow with more goodies to benefit incumbents who are up for reelection.”
It remains to be seen whether or not President Donald Trump will win a second term in November. Many recent polls have shown Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — in some of them, by double digits. But whether Trump leaves the White House in January 2021 or January 2025, Republicans will eventually have to debate what a post-Trump GOP will look like — and as Hohmann sees it, the clash between Cruz and Cotton could foreshadow a clash between the Republican senators in 2024.
“Cruz and Cotton are among the small clique of ambitious Republican senators in their forties who have been laying the groundwork to run for president in 2024, along with Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.),” Hohmann explains. “The dueling stances Cruz and Cotton staked out behind closed doors offer an early taste of the ideological battles we can expect as Republicans increasingly vie to take the torch from President Trump. These fights will flare up faster and hotter if the president loses in November. Others outside the Senate, such as Vice President (Mike) Pence and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, are also expected to compete for the nod.”

But then, in a time when the president of the United States sits for a formal interview and incoherently makes up facts, at a time when enough people sneer at masks even in the face of rising deaths, at a time when our government thinks it a good idea to undercut health services and food stamps during a pandemic and threatens to withhold funds for schools that do not open fully when the schools need more money, maybe this is now par for the course.
We’re being played as pawns in an imagined ideological banner-waving war.
Winning or losing aside, we ought to be able to agree on whether any of these strategies and tactics – thought through or not – are effective.
How much better off we’d be if the federal authorities, starting with Trump himself, could bring himself to look at the issue at the heart of the protests – a systematic bias built that keeps a knee on the necks of Black and brown communities.
In Portland, demonstrations following the deaths of George Floyd and a long list of other Black citizens stopped by police in routine matters have grown wild enough to be called “riots,” by authorities, though the damage seems mostly minor vandalism to the outside of buildings, including the federal courthouse. That target was sufficient for the Department of Homeland Security to unleash at least 100 unnamed, unmarked customs and immigration agents, who have earned ignominy by snatching people almost at random off the streets to hold them for hours, charge some, and release most – all while ignoring local and state police, the mayor and governor, who asked them to leave.
The demonstrators countered with a linked line of moms who put themselves between authorities and protesters. They were tear-gassed, so the women were joined by a line dads armed with leaf blowers to disperse the gas. This is not good,
Sending Secret Police
OK, let’s assert that social messaging demonstrations are most persuasive if they stay peaceful, and that throwing objects, tagging and starting fires just muddy the enforcement waters.
But the response of sending uniformed thugs, untrained in riot control as it turns out, into a tumultuous environment without serious rules of engagement and using the tactics of secret police units fails any measure of effectiveness. It doesn’t work as intended, and it raises a new set of issues for all sides over whether the president has a “secret police” force and against whom to deploy. Also, sending 100?
Worse, Homeland Security looked at several nights of this, and concluded that they will double down – at the order of Donald Trump. The demonstrators have concluded that their job is to keep pushing. The local authorities, including the police, caught in the middle here, have decided to let enthusiastic fires burn themselves out while keep an eye out to prevent more dangerous levels of uncontrolled rioting. In other words, no one is being effective at any goals they want to pursue.
It seems unwise if not pointless to continue nightly attacks on an empty courthouse, and more than unwise to send unmarked agents to snatch people from the streets. That’s the stuff of the worst of authoritarian governments – you know, the thing American values say they oppose.
Here’s Kenneth Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, saying that his agency had deployed tactical units from ICE and Customs and Border Protection to defend federal buildings in Portland and other unnamed cities. “You can expect that if violence continues in other parts of the country, the president has made no secret of the fact that he expects us where we can cooperate or have jurisdiction to step forward and expand our policing efforts there to bring down the level of violence,” Cuccinelli said.
How much better off we’d be if the federal authorities, starting with Trump himself, could bring himself to look at the issue at the heart of the protests – a systematic bias built into governmental, financial, health, housing, job and education institutions that results in keeping a knee on the necks of Black and brown communities.
Inevitably, Politics
Instead, as we have been seeing repeatedly, Trump turns to unequal Law & Order in pursuit of the defending a Trump agenda first, and justice, in any of its forms, almost never. In his contentious and long Fox News interview Sunday with Chris Wallace, as in its own unrestricted, unchallenged speeches and tweets, Trump comes down time after time in defense of Confederate legacy over the complaints of Black Lives Matter, on his insistence that whites suffer more police abuse than Blacks (this is a good thing?) without reference to population, that policing is not biased, and that the spread of coronavirus is only the logical result of widened testing. It was nonsense, and Wallace successfully called him on it.
Trump, down in political polls, is lashing out. Therefore, there must be enemies to use as props in his reelection effort. Demonstrators who choose at this moment to attack a federal courthouse as the locals watch is too rich a target for Trump to ignore.
But nothing here is getting done: The protests continue, and next are deployments to new cities.
So, too, is a pending election that Trump is seeking to undercut with opposition to mail ballots, international relationships, congressional coronavirus aid and destruction of environmental protections. Trump could win an election for National Wrecking Ball in a heartbeat, but in solving problems, not so much. Remarkable weekend recapitulations in The New York Times and The Washington Post outlined exactly how the Trump administration and the richest country on Earth lost control over coronavirus, for example.
Unleashing secret federal agents is merely adding objectionable behavior and confusion into the mix. It is not stopping the message of demonstrators, nor are demonstrators nor local officials intimidated. Instead, the Portland mayor and Oregon governor now have sued the feds.
What have we gained? How many of these do we need to show ineffectiveness?

0,2020-07-22T16:25:12+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/legal-experts-trumps-use-of-federal-dhs-officers-in-portland-is-bad-and-ineffective-law-enforcement/,Legal experts: Trump’s use of federal DHS officers in Portland is ‘bad and ineffective law enforcement’,"President Donald Trump and Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, have been drawing a great deal of criticism for the way in which federal law enforcement officers have been conducting themselves during George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon — where men in military-like camouflage have been emerging from unmarked vehicles and detaining protesters. Legal experts Benjamin Wittes and Quinta Jurecic, in a July 21 article for The Atlantic, analyze Trump’s use of federal law enforcement in Portland and explain why it is wildly inappropriate.
“Whether the Trump Administration has the technical legal authority to deploy this show of force in this particular matter does not answer the question of whether it should do so,” Wittes and Jurecic argue. “The use of federal officers in this manner is corrosive of democratic culture, it makes for bad and ineffective law enforcement, and it’s likely physically dangerous both for the law enforcement officers and for the protesters in question.”
Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon has denounced the officers as “Trump’s secret police,” and other critics of the president have said that the images coming out of Portland recall Italy under Benito Mussolini or Chile under Gen. Augusto Pinochet.” Gov. Kate Brown, also a Democrat, told PBS that “Trump’s troops” were “pouring gasoline on a fire.”
A peaceful protester in Portland was shot in the head by one of Donald Trump’s secret police. Now Trump and Chad Wolf are weaponizing the DHS as their own occupying army to provoke violence on the streets of my hometown because they think it plays well with right-wing media.

Wittes and Jurecic write that although DHS is authorized to protect federal property — including the federal courthouse in Portland — DHS has been overreaching in Oregon’s largest city.
According to Wittes and Jurecic, “The existence of the department’s authority to protect federal property is uncontroversial. The federal government has the power to defend federal buildings and facilities from civil unrest, and a variety of federal laws protect federal property from attack and vandalism and federal officials from interference with their discharge of the government’s business. While this authority certainly extends to the power to investigate federal crimes and arrest those suspected of them, it is not some general authority to patrol the downtowns of major cities and pick up and detain protesters merely because a federal building may be in the neighborhood.”
The legal experts note that the “tactical divisions of the Homeland Security Department from which the officers in Portland appear to hail — Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — are not typically deployed at protests, but charged with enforcing immigration law and guarding the U.S. border…. Sending out officers untrained for demonstrations risks violence if the agents end up in situations they don’t know how to handle.”
Wittes and Jurecic conclude their article by saying that if Trump’s desire is to discourage the protesters in Portland, it “doesn’t seem to be working.”
“Last night in Portland, as happened last month in Washington, D.C., peaceful protests only grew in response to the federal show of force,” Wittes and Jurecic write. “If Trump follows through on his promise to export the federal muscle to other cities, the anonymous agents may be met with more large crowds defying Trump’s efforts at vilification and coercion.”

He says those words “were never spoken by me to my colleagues,” but he did not deny saying them.
Yoho declared he is apologizing – not for his sexist slur – but “for the abrupt manner of the conversation I had with my colleague from New York.”
U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida made the offensive remark as he was walking down the steps of Capitol Hill, and Rep. Ocasio-Cortez was ascending. He first attacked her over her remarks about poverty, in which she had said one of the leading causes of low-level crime is simply people being hungry and stealing items like food to feed their families.
In his Wednesday morning remarks, Rep. Yoho said the “offensive name-calling words attributed to me by the press were never spoken to my colleagues,” Yoho insisted, which is exceptionally specific for a reason. “If they were construed that way, I apologize for their misunderstanding.”
In other words, he is apologizing for the press misunderstanding his intent, which is not only inaccurate, but shows he lacks any remorse, although he claimed to be “a man of my word.”
Yoho’s office says he did not say the sexist slur to AOC directly, but seconds after their initial confrontation, as he moved on. A reporter heard the conversation and says they were definitely said about the Congresswoman.
The Florida Republican added he would not apologize for his “passion, loving my God, my family or my country.”
He also revealed that he and his wife had “nothing” when they married at age 19, and lived on welfare.
“We did odd jobs,” Yoho said, pausing, then adding, “We were on food stamps. I know the face of poverty, And for a time it was mine.”
He went on to suggest that Ocasio-Cortez acknowledging poverty can lead to crime is a way for her to “encourage” law-breaking.
Despite Rep. Yoho and his family using and needing food stamps early in their lives, he voted to cut $40 billion out of the food stamp program, SNAP, in 2013. At the time, the average benefit was a mere $133 a month.
In 2018 The Gainesville Sun editorial board accused Yoho of prioritizing “out-of-the-area sugar producers who give him campaign contributions over his constituents that are recipients of food stamps.”
And last year an opinion column in The Florida Times-Union accused Yoho of voting “against interests of his constituents,” noted the Florida Congressman calls the food stamp “program ‘a trap.’ He has voted for massive cuts in the program and favors harsh work requirements, even though research indicates these impede access to benefits from a program that consistently shows extremely low fraud by recipients.”

And Defense Secretary Mark Esper, according to Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman, is expressing concerns about their attire and believes the American public should be able to distinguish between military troops and police officers.
The Military.com website reports that on Tuesday, July 21, Hoffman told reporters, “We want a system where people can tell the difference. I can say unequivocally there are no Department of Defense assets that have been deployed to, pending deployment to, or we’re looking to deploy to Portland.”
Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown are among the Democrats who have been highly critical of President Donald Trump’s use of federal law enforcement against protesters in Portland, where federal law enforcement officers have been driving around in unmarked vehicles and attacking protesters. Wyden has described them as “Trump’s secret police,” and Brown told PBS that “Trump’s troops” were “pouring gasoline on a fire” in Oregon’s largest city.
Hoffman told reporters, “There are some law enforcement (who) wear uniforms that make them appear military, and the secretary has expressed his concern with this within the (Trump) Administration.”
Esper, according to Hoffman, “has expressed his concern that in some cases, law enforcement appropriately performing law enforcement duties were misconstrued with military personnel — who would not be appropriately doing those (duties).”

0,2020-07-22T15:27:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/1151617/,Leaked memo: Trump administration authorized domestic surveillance of protests to protect statues,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authorized domestic surveillance to identify threats against monuments and statues in response to President Donald Trump’s executive order targeting vandalism against federal memorials, according to a department memo obtained by Lawfare.
The document, issued by the DHS Office of Intelligence & Analysis, described “Activities in Furtherance of Protecting American Monuments, Memorials, Statues and Combatting Recent Criminal Violence.”
The document says DHS personnel are “collecting and reporting on various activities in the context of elevated threats targeting monuments, memorials and statues.” It also provides legal guidance on the “expanded intelligence activities necessary to mitigate the significant threat to homeland security” posed by threats to statues.
Senior DHS official Ken Cuccinelli appeared to refer to intelligence gathering on protests during a Monday interview with CNN.
“We got intelligence about planned attacks on federal facilities,” he said in response to questions about the administration’s controversial deployment of federal authorities to Portland. “If we get the same kind of intelligence in other places about threats to other facilities or officers, we would respond the same way.”
But the memo “makes clear that the authorized intelligence activity covers significantly more than just planned attacks on federal personnel or facilities,” wrote Benjamin Wittes, a Lawfare editor, and Steve Vladeck, a national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. “It appears to also include planned vandalism of Confederate (and other historical) monuments and statues, whether federally owned or not.”
The document provides legal guidance to personnel detailing what kind of intelligence collection is appropriate. The document was issued after Trump signed an executive order on June 26 reasserting that the federal government would prosecute “any person or any entity that destroys, damages, vandalizes or desecrates a monument, memorial or statue within the United States or otherwise vandalizes government property.”
The order directed Attorney General William Barr to work with local law enforcement to pursue investigations and prosecutions of alleged monument and statue vandals “regardless of whether such structures are situated on federal property.”
Though the order was “widely mocked for not doing anything” since a 2003 statute already made it a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison to damage any “any structure, plaque, statue or other monument on public property commemorating the service of any person or persons in the armed forces of the United States,” Wittes and Vladeck wrote, the DHS appears to be “interpreting the June executive order as defining a new homeland security priority — one that actually justifies intelligence collection.”
The document says the legal guidance is “specific to expanded intelligence activities necessary to mitigate the significant threat to homeland security articulated in the president’s executive order of June 26, 2020.”
It specifically authorizes personnel to “engage in physical surveillance, the use of mail covers and the use of monitoring devices only to the extent permitted by and consistent with [rules limiting their use to counterintelligence investigations].”
“I&A personnel are not permitted to engage in electronic surveillance or unconsented physical searches,” it adds. “Use of these techniques within the United States will be coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”
This means, Wittes and Vladeck wrote, that protesters can “reasonably expect that there will be ongoing DHS collection and analysis of public source information” and likely the social media posts of demonstrators.
The document states that this intelligence collection is authorized in response to threats of violence and threats to damage government facilities. But it also adds that it can be used in response to “threats to damage or destroy any public monument, memorial or statue (MMS).”
The memo clarifies that the surveillance cannot be used “for the sole purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment or the lawful exercise of other constitutional or legal rights, or for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent.” Officials must “establish reasonable belief” that the intelligence collection supports one of the stated missions.
“You may collect information about (i) threats to MMS; (ii) individuals or groups that pose such threats, or their tactics, techniques or procedures (TTPs); and (iii) information that otherwise informs an overall assessment that threats to MMS will materialize,” the memo says, adding that “persons merely engaging in non-violent protest activities near MMS or making hyperbolic statements about MMS likely do not constitute a threat to MMS.”
A “‘threat to MMS’ means the infliction of any damage sufficient to impede the purpose or function of the MMS,” the memo continues.
The document goes on to add that any information collected which does not relate to one of the stated missions must be purged within 180 days. Information retained by the agency can be disseminated to other federal, state and local law enforcement in advance of any of the stated missions.
The memo drew concerns from legal experts.
“It is unpersuasive, because it should be obvious that vandalism and other damage to monuments, even federal monuments, does not threaten the security of the homeland to any greater extent than most property crimes,” Wittes and Vladeck wrote. “The premise is alarming, because it uses the cover of minor property damage, whether to federal property or otherwise, to justify intelligence gathering against ordinary Americans — most of whom have nothing to do with the underlying property damage, and many of whom are engaged in the most American of activities: peacefully protesting their government.”

“What we’re seeing in my hometown is authoritarian brutality unleashed against peaceful protesters—moms and veterans and doctors and activists who are standing up for liberty and justice,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said in a speech on the Senate floor unveiling his amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.
“What Donald Trump is doing is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy laid out by our founders and expanded through the generations,” Wyden continued. “Donald Trump did not send in this paramilitary force to keep people safe. Trump is doing this to create images of chaos, to air them on far-right television and in campaign ads, and scare the country into reelecting him.”
Amendment co-sponsor Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) used his floor speech Tuesday to highlight the case of Donavan LaBella, a 26-year-old peaceful demonstrator whose skull was fractured when federal officers shot him in the head with an impact munition during a protest earlier this month.
“Secret police, unmarked, patrolling streets, throwing people into unmarked vehicles and sweeping them away—that’s what you get from authoritarian dictators, not a country, a republic where we have a Constitution and we have rights,” said Merkley. “That’s what’s going on here. That’s what has to stop.”
According to a summary of the measure released by Merkley’s office, the amendment would “limit federal agents’ crowd control activities to federal property and its immediate vicinity, unless their presence is specifically requested by both the mayor and governor.” The proposal would also “require individual and agency identification on uniforms of officers and prevent unmarked vehicles from being used in arrests.”
HAPPENING NOW: I’m on the Floor to demand the Senate take up our amendment ending the use of Trump’s secret police in Portland & across the country. Dictators use secret police, not leaders of a Democratic Republic. This has to stop, & it has to stop now. https://t.co/0znr6q1Wms
— Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) July 21, 2020
The amendment came as large protests continued in Portland for the 55th consecutive night Tuesday. As Oregon Live reported:
Portlanders have amassed every night since late May to demand reforms to the criminal justice system. The crowds had decreased in size. But repeated use of force by federal officers against protesters—which occurred again Tuesday—has fueled larger crowds and attracted nationwide scrutiny to Portland.
A pair of parent groups, the Wall of Moms and PDXDadPod, organized in recent days to attend the protests. More than 200 women connected to the moms group showed up at Tuesday night’s protests to rally against the presence of federal officers. One person held a sign that said, “You need a time out.”
On Monday, as Common Dreams reported, Trump threatened to deploy federal forces to Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore, and Oakland to confront Black Lives Matter protesters.
In a letter Monday to Attorney General William Barr and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, the Democratic mayors of those cities and several others demanded that the Trump administration immediately withdraw federal officials from Portland and scrap any plans to send agents elsewhere.
“The murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked a national uprising and reckoning,” the mayors wrote. “The majority of the protests have been peaceful and aimed at improving our communities. Where this is not the case, it still does not justify the use of federal forces. Unilaterally deploying these paramilitary-type forces into our cities is wholly inconsistent with our system of democracy and our most basic values.”

Mitch McConnell’s push to reopen schools in the middle of the pandemic. That’s what Public Policy Polling (PPP) found in a poll conducted July 17-18 in Kentucky for Protect Our Care. This, by the way, was a group of 1,547 Kentucky voters who won for Donald Trump in 2016, 57% to 33%. That’s 24-point margin for Trump. It’s also about the same margin—56% to 31%—who disagree with McConnell’s push to have kids back in school even as coronavirus infections continue to rise.
Likewise, a majority of Kentuckians support everything that Democrats included in coronavirus relief, all the things McConnell is fighting: 73% to 14% support increasing funding for testing and treatment for the coronavirus; 68% support increasing federal funding for Medicaid, with only 17% opposed; 66% support an additional round of $1,200 stimulus payments to most Americans, 25% are opposed; 65% support allocating $1 trillion to state and local governments to pay vital workers like first responders, health workers, and teachers, just 21% oppose; 57% support a 15% increase in food assistance to families and additional funding to pay for nutritional programs, just 27% oppose; 52% support creating a special enrollment period for Americans to sign up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, just 26% oppose. On every single issue, Kentucky opposes McConnell and Trump.
But where McConnell is really in trouble is standing with Trump on forcing schools to reopen. A 61% majority of Kentuckians trust medical experts more than Trump to make the decision whether children should be back in school. Just 35% of them think will be safe. They are also opposed to the proposal that school funding be withheld from schools that follow the advice of medical experts and do not reopen in the fall, 52% to 29%.
No wonder McConnell is so far behind Kentucky’s Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear in approval ratings. McConnell is underwater by eight points (40-48) to Beshear’s 19-point advantage with voters, 54% approval to 35% disapproval. That’s nothing to his national numbers, though.
Beating McConnell in Kentucky is going to be a hard haul. He is always underwater in his home state but continues to win because he brings stuff back. But with McConnell and what he’s fighting against in this bill, so unpopular even in his home state, imagine how unpopular it will be for voters in Maine, in Colorado, in Iowa and Texas and Georgia, where all those vulnerable Republican senators don’t have his kind of clout.

“Houston’s Chinese Consulate abruptly ordered to close by Trump administration” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
CHANGSHA, China — The United States has ordered China to close its consulate in Houston by Friday, an abrupt move that opens up a new front in a battle for supremacy between the world’s two biggest economies.
Beijing immediately vowed to retaliate for the “unprecedented escalation,” leading to speculation it could order the closure of the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, which has been shuttered since the coronavirus epidemic spread across the city in January.
The confrontation in the diplomatic sphere widens a conflict that already incorporated trade and technology, freedom of the press and religion, students and scientists, as well as the novel coronavirus and the race for a vaccine.
Analysts on both sides say that bilateral relations are at their worst since before 1979, when the United States formally recognized the People’s Republic of China.
“At this rate, I wouldn’t even be surprised if Trump decides to sever diplomatic relations with China someday,” said Chu Shulong, a professor in American politics and diplomacy at Tsinghua University, suggesting that this was part of President Trump’s reelection strategy.
“Trump has no limits, no principles and no morals, and that’s why he can stoop so low and yet few bother to raise an eyebrow,” Chu said.
The Trump administration decided to order the closure of China’s Consulate in Houston, which was opened in 1979 and is situated in an area with a large Chinese community, “in order to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Wednesday.
“The United States will not tolerate the PRC’s violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the PRC’s unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs and other egregious behavior,” she said, using the abbreviation for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China.
The State Department did not elaborate on the alleged infractions, but Ortagus suggested that China had violated the Vienna Convention, which governs diplomatic relations between states. Under the convention, diplomats must “respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State” and “have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that State.”
In Copenhagen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, when asked by a journalist about the order to close the Houston consulate, cited the reporter’s question that noted the United States had “long complained” about alleged Chinese intellectual property theft.
“Your point that this has been going on for a long time makes our point,” Pompeo told the journalist. “President Trump has said ‘enough.’ We’re not going to allow this.”
The first sign of the American order came when Houston NBC affiliate KPRC2 aired video showing people in the courtyard of the consulate apparently burning documents after 8 p.m. local time on Tuesday.
Police and fire officials went to the scene in response to calls from neighbors but, in accordance with diplomatic rules, did not enter the building, the television station reported.
Witnesses in nearby apartment buildings told police that people were burning paper in what appeared to be trash cans, a police official told the Houston Chronicle. The consulate staff had been told they would be evicted from the building at 4 p.m. Friday, the paper quoted the unnamed official as saying.
In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry responded angrily to the order. The U.S. government “abruptly informed” China on Tuesday that it had to immediately close its consulate in Houston, Wang Wenbin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters Wednesday.
“The U.S. has far more diplomatic missions and staff working in China. So if the U.S. is bent on going down this wrong path, we will resolutely respond,” Wang said.
Analysts expect the Chinese government to respond by ordering one of them closed. Beijing was particularly incensed that the United States evacuated its consulate in Wuhan in January, as the virus began spreading rapidly across the city.
It has still not reopened, and the embassy and other consulates are operating with skeleton staffs, according to American officials.
Hu Xijin, the firebrand editor of the Communist Party-affiliated Global Times newspaper who often shares information on Twitter that has not been officially announced, revealed the 72-hour time frame
“This is a crazy move,” he wrote.
The Global Times started polls on Twitter and its Chinese equivalent, Weibo, asking: “Which US consulate general in China is most likely to be closed?” It gave four options: “Hong Kong and Macao, Guangzhou, Chengdu or other.”
The order came amid American attacks on China’s political system, its harassment of Chinese diplomats and its intimidation of Chinese students, Wang said.
He said the consulate had been getting prank phone calls and even received a bomb threat on Monday. He added that U.S. authorities have opened China’s diplomatic pouches and searched Chinese diplomats’ property.
The United States and China have been locked in a tit-for-tat battle for supremacy that began at the start of the Trump administration, centered on trade and technology. Both sides have expelled journalists this year and have been slapping sanctions on each other’s officials.
But the hostilities have become much more serious with Trump’s efforts to blame the Chinese government for the coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan at the end of last year and retaliatory actions over journalists in the two countries.
U.S. officials on Tuesday accused China of sponsoring criminal hackers, including two former engineering students, who were targeting biotech firms around the world working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments.
The Foreign Ministry on Wednesday renewed its travel warning for Chinese students in the United States, advising them to be aware of arbitrary interrogations, the confiscation of personal belongings and possible detentions.
Wang Yong, a professor of international studies at Peking University, said certain people in Washington seem hellbent on promoting a cold war between China and the United States and the complete decoupling of the two countries, not just in the economic arena but across the board.
“I think they have political considerations, mainly around the election,” Wang said. “They are taking such a tough approach, demonizing and turning hostile to China, making China an enemy, to mobilize people domestically and reverse the unfavorable situation of President Trump in the election.”
This would lead to international instability, he said. “In the end, it will harm U.S. interests and harm China. It won’t benefit the United States.”
Chu, the Tsinghua professor, agreed that there was potential for further tension.
“China could always evict a U.S. Consulate in retaliation, and that could go on and on,” he said. “If the eviction stays a largely technical move, then the two governments should be able to reach a compromise in the next few months; but if it turns out to be strategic, then this risks escalating into Cold War 2.0.”
Many analysts in China view Trump’s campaign against the country as part of an effort to boost his chances of winning second term.
“China is an easy target, and a ‘big bad guy’ that Trump is all too eager to open fire on in order to win conservatives over in his reelection campaign,” Chu said.

According to Politico reporter Betsy Woodruff Swan, all four of them are among the 27 attorneys who have signed a July 22 letter asking the Association to conduct an investigation to determine whether or not Barr has violated its rules.
The D.C. Barr Association authorizes attorneys to practice law in Washington, D.C., including many who work in the federal government. According to Swan, the attorneys’ “complaint argues that Barr has broken Washington’s ethics rules by being dishonest and violating his oath to uphold the Constitution, along with other charges. And it highlights four episodes in Barr’s time as attorney general to make the case: his characterization of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russia’s 2016 election interference, his criticism of an inspector general report on the Russia probe, his criticism of FBI officials in a TV interview, and his role in the disbursement of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square outside the White House.”
The letter states, “Mr. Barr’s client is the United States, and not the president. Yet Mr. Barr has consistently made decisions and taken action to serve the personal and political self-interests of President Donald Trump rather than the interest of the United States.”
The four ex-presidents of the D.C. Barr Association who signed the letter are Andrea C. Ferster, Melvin White, Philip Allen Lacovara and Marna S. Tucker. Others who signed it range from Abbe Smith (a law professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.) to Roy L. Austin, Jr. (a former deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice’s civil rights division).
Swan notes, “The letter comes as Barr faces sharp criticism from leaders in the legal profession. Late last month, the president of the New York City Bar Association and chair of its task force on the rule of law sent a letter to top members of Congress calling him ‘unfit’ for his job and raising some of the same concerns raised in this letter.”
Scott Harshbarger, co-founder of Lawyers Defending American Democracy and former Massachusetts attorney general, discussed the letter in an article for Just Security and explained why the complaint is so serious.
Harshbarger emphasized, “Sober and highly experienced lawyers like those who signed the complaint wouldn’t take such an action except in extraordinary circumstances. It is only because Attorney General Barr’s abuses are so serious, so repetitive and so well documented in the complaint that the signers felt compelled to hold Mr. Barr accountable — to protect the integrity of the legal profession and the American legal system.”

Its leaders just refused to shake Mike Pompeo’s hand,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to shake hands with Danish officials during his trip to Europe on Wednesday — but they avoided touching his hands.
Washington Post national security reporter John Hudson brings word that Pompeo was rebuffed in his attempts to shake hands with his counterparts, including Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod and Greenlandic Foreign Minister Steen Lynge.
“In Denmark (which does not have a corona outbreak) Pompeo went to shake hands with the Danish Foreign Minister, who didn’t offer his hand back,” Hudson writes. “Pompeo extended his hand to the Faroese FM who also would not shake hands. Pompeo then elbow bumped with the Greenlandic FM.”
According to the latest data compiled by the Financial Times, Denmark has averaged less than one COVID-19 death per day over the last week, while the United States is now averaging nearly 800 COVID-19 deaths a day.
And while Denmark at the moment is averaging just over 34 new COVID-19 cases a day, the United States is now averaging more than 65,000 new cases per day.

0,2020-07-22T14:19:41+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/what-trump-will-do-if-he-loses-is-the-wrong-question-what-matters-is-what-his-supporters-will-do/,What Trump will do if he loses is the wrong question. What matters is what his supporters will do,"It looks like Biden will beat Trump badly and the Republicans will suffer disastrous losses across the country in November. Although the polls have just been inching toward the Democrats, suddenly articles about what Trump might do if he loses are multiplying, here, here, and here.
Trump might declare the elections fake, go on FOX News to say he had really won, call out the National Guard, barricade himself in the Oval Office, order the Secret Service to shoot Biden on sight.
But what he will do is the wrong question. What matters is what his supporters will do when they lose.
Three groups of supporters are crucial to observe. The media will focus at first on Republican politicians. Will Senate losers in Montana, Arizona, Colorado, and other states jump on the fake news bandwagon? Would Mitch McConnell go quietly if Amy McGrath beats him in a very close race? Maybe Susan Collins will accept defeat in Maine, but what about QAnon promoter Jo Rae Perkins in Oregon? How about Lauren Boebert, QAnon enthusiast and House candidate in Colorado, and the other 7 Republican congressional candidates on the ballot who have expressed support for QAnon?
The whole Republican Senate delegation has already cast doubt on the results by allowing their leader to proclaim unchallenged that the election will be fraudulent. On June 22, Trump said the 2020 election “will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history”. In 2018, the National Republican Senatorial Committee followed up a Trump tweet about “electoral corruption” in the Arizona Senate race by charging that the election they lost there was rigged. Stripped of power, perhaps for years, it’s not hard to imagine Senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, among others, casting doubt on the results.
Thus far the bravest Republicans in Washington, aside from Mitt Romney, are Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who called Trump’s pardon of Roger Stone a “mistake”, and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who said she won’t campaign against Joe Biden. The majority of Senate Republicans cowers in silence.
Will Trump’s toadies now running our intelligence services and justice system speak up and what will they say? Across the country, Republican state legislators who lose their gerrymandered majorities could join the chorus.
A second set of Trump supporters use their control of media to send waves of influence into every corner of America. Will FOX News report the official results or attack them? How about the other people to whom Republicans listen, even more partisan and less connected to reality, like Limbaugh, Breitbart, InfoWars, Drudge? Will powerful evangelical pastors Franklin Graham and Robert Jeffress proclaim that their God-given leader was cheated?
The third group is the most important and hardest to gauge – the MAGA-hat-wearing, Confederate-flag-waving white supremacists and conspiracy partisans who make up his legendary “base”. Will they see the end times coming as their messiah is defeated? Will the dozens of armed militia groups adopt 2nd Amendment remedies to the impending takeover of America by radical socialist pedophiles? What will Ammon Bundy, the boogaloo boys, the Oath Keepers, and the more than 500 other anti-government groups loosely allied in the so-called “patriot movement” identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center do? Will the NRA call out its members to fight the commies?
Trump could scream himself hoarse with no effect unless his supporters sing along. As full election results trickle in the days after November 3 and as the implications sink in with the approach of Inauguration Day on January 20, 2021, a coalition of supporters in Washington, state governments, media, and on the ground might throw our country into an existential, not merely Constitutional crisis.
It’s certain that Trump will do nothing brave himself, will commit himself to no action that he can’t back out of. But the radicals who drive their cars into Black Lives Matter protesters, who bring their assault rifles to the pizza palace, and who believe anything “Q” says are much more volatile, unhinged, and violent.
Whatever answers such questions might elicit now will change over the next few months, as Trump stokes more fear among his supporters, pushes them further away from the American center, and forces his Republican allies to come along.
Watch Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Matt Gaetz (Florida) and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (California), Gov. Ron DeSantis (Florida), and Mark Meadows, White House Chief of Staff. Watch wily Mitch McConnell, who shares with Trump a powerful belief in the importance of his own survival.
And watch out for America.

0,2020-07-22T14:02:27+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/from-loans-and-donations-to-fundraising-whistleblowers-are-voicing-concerns-about-trumps-connection-to-the-church-of-scientology/,‘From loans and donations to fundraising’: Whistleblowers are voicing concerns about Trump’s connection to the Church of Scientology,"Leah Remini and Mike Rinder were once prominent members of the Church of Scientology, but these days, they are outspoken critics of the cult and are painting a very dark picture of its activities. Remini has stressed that Scientology has a wide outreach, and in an interview with the Daily Beast, the whistleblowers discussed Scientology’s connections President Donald Trump as well as Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
The Beast’s Marlow Stern reports, “The celebrity-obsessed church — which professes that an intergalactic overlord named Xenu brought billions of aliens to Earth 75 million years ago, arranged them at the base of volcanoes, blew them up with hydrogen bombs, and their surviving souls haunt the human race — received three loans of up to $350,000 each for its sites in New York, Florida and Washington, D.C., supporting what it claims is a total of 137 employees. It’s a curious decision by the Trump Administration, awarding hundreds of thousands of dollars to a scandal-plagued organization that, due to its tax-exempt status, has reportedly amassed more than $1 billion in assets — mostly in real-estate holdings.”
Remini, according to Stern, is outraged that Scientology has profited so handsomely from Trump’s policies. The Scientology whistleblower told the Beast, “It’s insane. Mike and I have tried to meet many times with the IRS, and the IRS knows what they’ve done. They’ve known that they’ve cleared the way for Scientology to misappropriate their money. It’s run like a business for profit, and this just says that.”
According to Remini, Joy Villa — a singer and prominent Scientologist — has “infiltrated the Trump Administration.” And Scientology has taken advantage of the Paycheck Protection Program, which is part of the CARES Act of 2020 and is designed to help businesses that are struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.
Rinder told the Beast, “The PPP loans were about ensuring that people don’t lose their jobs, and Scientology — when confronted about the fact that they don’t pay minimum wage or anything — say these people are volunteers. Staff members of Scientology organizations are ‘volunteers’; they’re not employees, and they’re getting loans so that people don’t lose their jobs?”
Stern notes that Trump’s charity made a Scientology-related donation. The Beast journalist reports, “According to a 2015 investigation by The Smoking Gun that analyzed — and published portions of — tax-return filings from the Donald J. Trump Charitable Foundation between 1990 and 2014, Trump’s charity arm made only one donation to a September 11-related cause in the wake of the tragedy: $1000 to the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project. That program, started by the Church of Scientology and (actor) Tom Cruise, sought to heal first responders with smoke-damaged lungs via the ‘Purification Rundown’ — a medically unproven detox method that involves pumping the body full of vitamins, performing loads of exercise and spending many hours a day in a sauna. Scientists and health professionals have called it ‘dangerous.’”
Farrakhan, meanwhile, might seem an unlikely ally of Scientology. The Nation of Islam preaches a black separatist ideology, claiming that the white race was invented 6000 years ago by an evil mad scientist named Yakub — a claim that is rejected in traditional Sunni or Shiite Islam — and most of Scientology’s members have been white. But Stern reports that “since 2010, the Nation of Islam has been promoting the ‘benefits’ of Dianetics, the core set of principles taught by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.” During a July 1, 2012 speech in Chicago, Farrakhan told Nation of Islam members, “I found the tool that I know can help us, and I thank God for Mr. L. Ron Hubbard. And I thank God for his research and teaching.”
Stern notes that photos of Tony Muhammad, the Nation of Islam’s West Coast regional minister, are “plastered all over the Scientology website” — and that Muhammad has been “the recipient the IAS Freedom Medal, the church’s most coveted award, for spreading its teachings.”
Rinder said of the Nation of Islam/Scientology alliance, “It’s such an ugly marriage of convenience between these two, and it’s going to ultimately end in an ugly divorce, because both of these organizations believe that they are the only true answer. Scientology, through (leader) David Miscavige, has done enormous things to try to engage and involve the Nation of Islam in Scientology. They have subsidized their involvement and given the highest Scientology awards to Tony Muhammad, the West Coast leader of the Nation of Islam. They have Nation of Islam people showing up to their events, acting as security people — and conversely, Farrakhan is preaching from his pulpit about the ‘great man’ L. Ron Hubbard, who’s come to save the Black man. It’s utterly insane.”

“Among other things, the Biden campaign is accusing Johnson of being opaque about whether he is, in effect, ‘party to a foreign influence operation against the United States’ by receiving materials from pro-Russian foreigners as part of the committee’s probe,” reported Heidi Przybyla.
“A committee staffer told NBC News it is ‘false’ the committee has received any ‘oppo,’ or opposition research, without responding directly to whether that covers any materials from foreign sources,” said the report. However, the Biden campaign has noted that Johnson himself, the campaign, the White House, and the State Department “have all declined to comment on whether that is true — meaning that each are refusing to tell the American people whether they are party to a foreign influence operation against the United States.”
Additionally, Ukrainians aligned with the Kremlin have stated they are, in fact, passing this information along to the Johnson probe.
Biden’s accusation comes as several Democratic congressional officials are sending a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray warning that Congress is being targeted by a foreign effort to “launder” opposition research and undermine the 2020 presidential election. That letter did not mention the Johnson probe specifically, but sources told Politico it was what prompted the concern.
Republicans have been divided over Johnson’s probe, with some fearful it would backfire and draw public anger over Senate priorities.

0,2020-07-22T13:49:53+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/goodbye-qanon-twitter-bans-7000-conspiracy-mongers-and-places-limits-on-150000-others/,"Goodbye QAnon: Twitter bans 7,000 conspiracy mongers and places limits on 150,000 others","Twitter this morning is brought to you by every letter except “Q,” because after three years of rants about how the world is actually controlled by a high profile cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles, the social media platform has finally decided to crack down. In a sweeping action on Tuesday evening, Twitter announced that it was moving to mass-ban the whole Q-community, chopping 7,000 accounts completely and placing limits on content for 150,000 others.
“We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm,” said a notice from Twitter’s safety team. “In line with this approach, this week we are taking further action on so-called ‘QAnon’ activity across the service.” Twitter will implement tools that halt the recommendation of QAnon contents, limit the use of links to known QAnon sites, and work to keep the conspiracy from appearing in search results and lists of trending items. The action is sure to have Q-conspiracists including Twitter execs on their list of forked-tailed, deep-state, pizza-eating child smugglers, but the reason for the ban actually has less to do with the thousands of false accusations leveled at public figures by the Q faithful. It has much more to do with the misery that QAnon has spread to Twitter and other platforms with their attacks on ordinary people.
QAnon actually got its start on Twitter. Or at least, its “parent” did. On October 30, 2016, a Twitter account—one that had, notably, been posting mostly white supremacist talking points—made a claim that it was actually authored by a New York attorney, and that a big story was about to break. Tweets from this account, over the week leading to the 2016 election, spelled out a conspiracy that was supposedly known to the NYPD in which prominent Democratic officials, including Hillary Clinton, were involved in a pedophilia ring. The tweets connected the breaking announcements about Anthony Weiner’s emails, to supposed “coded messages” planted in emails that had been released by WikiLeaks, especially those belonging to campaign strategist John Podesta. Those key words? Pizza orders.
That was the origin for “Pizzagate,” a story that was expanded to include Satanic rituals in the basement of a business called Comet Ping Pong. And it was the reason a 29-year-old man drove from North Carolina to D.C. to threaten children with an AR-15 rifle while being baffled that Comet Ping Pong has no basement. Despite this debacle, Pizzagate-related conspiracy theories continued to circulate. And in October of 2017, QAnon first emerged from the genuinely hellish depths of the anonymous 4Chan comment board, which has played host to postings from mass shooters and served as a breeding ground for terrorism both foreign and domestic.
Eventually this all became a theory that could absorb anything and turn it into “evidence” that Donald Trump is waging a secret war against sex traffickers. This included how Trump was actually in league with Robert Mueller and started the whole Russia business as a means of luring Hillary Clinton into a trap. Also, there are going to be mass arrests of Democrats right … now. Or … now. Okay … now. Well … soon. Soon-ish.
Since that start, the conspiracy theory has grown from a single post to a huge following so intricately interwoven with the Republican Party that it threatens to take over the party completely. As Dave Neiwert noted last week, there are 64 openly QAnon-touting Republican candidates on the ballot for the fall. At the same time, Donald Trump and members of his White House are increasingly playing to this audience. When the Q conspiracy began, believers sifted every statement from Trump and others, looking for anything that might be considered a connection to their increasingly complex theory. Nowadays, they don’t have to look far, as people like Michael Flynn are embracing the whole thing. Meanwhile, QAnon has absorbed the “Obamagate” conspiracy pushed by Trump and embroidered it with thousands of all-new, all-false details. In many ways, QAnon has become the voice of Donald Trump’s supporters. And Trump has repeatedly retweeted some of their tweets calling for the arrest of Democratic politicians—despite the fact that the FBI designated QAnon as a likely source of domestic terrorism in 2019.
Over the last three years, both the supposed source of the Q information and the growing cadre of believers, have posted completely unfounded accusations against thousands of people. While many of these are public figures, some are just people who, like the poor employees back at that pizza place, managed to find themselves on the periphery of the expanding, nonsensical claims. Being on the wrong side of the Q-community has resulted in people on social media being targeted by thousands of accounts, and finding themselves suddenly accused of being, of course, Satan-worshiping pedophiles. And that’s often just the start.
The “where we go one, we go all” motto of the conspiracy is often very descriptive of tactics involved in these pile-ons. It’s how a conspiracy that is entirely fake, has generated scores of genuine victims, who find their lives upended by thousands of accusations. The level of attack is enough to upend the online presence of even celebrities with millions of followers. Last week, Chrissy Teigen ended up blocking over a million accounts after suffering through days of constant attacks that attempted to link her with a spiraling conspiracy theory involving Jeffrey Epstein.
Twitter officials told The Washington Post that Teigen’s experience was important in making the decision to finally move to block the spreading of false charges by QAnon accounts. It was more visible because of the star’s high profile, and her willingness to speak out rather than run away, but it was only one of many such attacks. Users without a celebrity podium have often been forced to retreat from these large scale “swarms,” especially when they’ve included not so disguised threats.

“Ivanka Trump’s jobs plan is not only stupid and wrong, it’s lazy,” he begins. “Find Something New’ embodies every wrong and dumb idea about how jobs work.”
Davidson then recounts Ivanka’s own career working as part of her father’s business empire that has seen her carry out several ethically and legally questionable operations.
“Her first big real estate job was with a money-launderer,” he writes. “Another major project she oversaw involved a likely money-laundering scheme for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. She also ran a jewelry business with a fraudster. She barely avoided getting arrested for a different real estate scheme in New York. And there are many, many, many other sketchy deals she’s participated in over the years.”
He goes on to roast Ivanka for putting together a shockingly shoddy career advice program.
“Announced with much fanfare, the jobs program amounts to a website with links,” he writes. “Seriously. That’s all it is. There are links to one of those handouts high school guidance counselors give you, asking if you want to work outdoors or in an office, or if you like ideas or working under pressure.”
After this, Davidson breaks down how the ideas advanced by the initiative get almost everything wrong about what it takes to find a job, particularly its emphasis on simply getting a college education.
“But for the majority of out-of-work individuals without a college degree, the idea that going to school will solve their problems is wrong,” he writes. “More of them will be deeper in debt and have more years without earnings, without improved career prospects.”

0,2020-07-22T13:34:30+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/internal-document-shows-cbp-protected-agent-involved-in-racist-facebook-group-from-firing/,Internal document shows CBP protected agent involved in racist Facebook group from firing,"The House Oversight Committee has released an internal document showing that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) negotiated deals to lessen the severity of punishment against agents who were part of a racist and vile Facebook group where members mocked the death of a teenaged boy in the agency’s custody last year.
Following an internal investigation of the “I’m 10-15” Facebook group, only four of nearly 140 agents were fired, we found out last week. But this internal document indicates that other agents also faced serious discipline but were instead shielded: “In one case, an employee who was recommended for removal had their penalty reduced to a seven-day suspension,” chair Carolyn Maloney said in a statement.
Heads should have rolled over the fact that nearly 140 CBP agents were a part of this vile group, where members also shared a doctored photo depicting the sexual assault of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by Donald Trump. In another attack on Ocasio-Cortez and colleague Veronica Escobar as they were to visit border facilities as part of their oversight responsibilities, another member, “apparently a patrol supervisor, wrote, ‘Fuck the hoes,’” ProPublica reported.
The Los Angeles Times reported that the internal investigation into the Facebook group eventually grew to nearly 140 employees before they were whittled down to just four firings. Agents clearly got away with it—and they had help from the inside. Maloney’s statement said that redactions to the internal document are blocking the committee from even knowing the names of the agents who were shielded and the supervisor who shielded them.
TODAY: Chair @RepMaloney released a new document that outlines how @CBP negotiated deals for employees who engaged in misconduct in secret #Facebook groups.
You can read it all here: https://t.co/HaiuRu9u0O pic.twitter.com/IMgrXRV40v
— Oversight Committee (@OversightDems) July 20, 2020
“CBP continues to obstruct the committee’s investigation by refusing to lift redactions, hiding names and roles of CBP employees as well as employee conduct, which is preventing the committee from determining whether the specific employees who made these threatening and repugnant posts continue to work for CBP in positions of power over immigrants and children,” Rep. Maloney said.
Following the report of the four firings last week, Rep. Escobar tweeted that she never got investigation results from CBP even though she was personally targeted by its agents. “The posts shouldn’t have just triggered firings but also an investigation into why other members never reported it,” she continued, calling Facebook “a cesspool.”
But so is CBP. As migrant kids died under the agency’s watch for the first time in a decade, the Government Accountability Office found CBP violated the law by using emergency humanitarian funding to pay for a canine program and dirt bikes. And now the agency is helping impeached president Donald Trump carry out his authoritarian agenda in Portland. Congress, defund this agency’s abuses already.

0,2020-07-22T13:30:05+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/defund-dhs-creating-a-massive-federal-police-apparatus-was-always-a-mistake/,Defund DHS: Creating a massive federal police apparatus was always a mistake,"It seems like only yesterday that Republicans were wringing their hands and rending their garments over federal officers attempting to arrest a large group of armed militia members who had taken over a federal building in Oregon and were refusing to leave. (The 2016 “Oregon standoff” is the subject of Anthony McCann’s fascinating book “Shadowlands.”) They were led by Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who triggered an earlier standoff with government forces in 2014, and they said they were planning to occupy the building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge “for years” as a protest against the conviction of two local ranchers who had been found guilty of arson for setting fire to government land. After six weeks of negotiating with federal authorities, the protesters were finally dispersed. Some did time but Ammon Bundy and a dozen others were tried and acquitted.
From 2014 to 2016, the right wing had been up in arms about the federal jack-booted thugs who were allegedly interfering in the protests by the God-fearing, freedom-loving Bundys and their armed allies who were just standing up for their rights. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., met personally with Cliven Bundy during the earlier standoff and said the group had legitimate constitutional questions. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was all-in, calling that protest “the unfortunate and tragic culmination of the path that President Obama has set the federal government on.”
Donald Trump also expressed support for Cliven Bundy, saying, “I like him, I like his spirit, his spunk and the people that are so loyal … I respect him.” (Bundy supported him right back.) In fact, Trump respected the Bundy movement so much he later pardoned Dwight and Stephen Hammond, the two ranchers who had been convicted of arson. They just burned federal land and their supporters only desecrated Native American artifacts on a federal wildlife refuge. It’s not like they tore down a statue or anything important.
I bring that story up now only because as we have watched the events unfold in Portland, Oregon, over the past few days — a few hours west of the Malheur refuge — with federal police in full military regalia attacking and kidnapping protesters, I’m struck by the deafening silence from all those erstwhile defenders of free speech and the right to protest. I guess in order for them to speak out, the protesters have to be carrying AR-15s.
Trump’s decision to send in DHS stormtroopers to Portland is anything but surprising. He’s been telegraphing his intention to do this since the George Floyd murder sparked protests in the beginning of June. And let’s be clear about the reasons. Trump doesn’t care about American cities or statues or “anarchy” or any of the rest of it. He cares about getting re-elected, and since he doesn’t know how to deal with the pandemic crisis, he figured he could use the Black Lives Matter protests to spark a white backlash that will carry him to victory.
Sending troops onto the streets to “dominate” the protesters has been his plan from the beginning. He hasn’t kept it a secret. It’s just that since the military balked at being used for this purpose, he’s had to cobble together units from the Department of Homeland Security and get them outfitted to look like they’re about to take Fallujah. (Using rented minivans seems a little off-brand, but I guess they must not have had time to roll in the tanks. )
I urge you to read the transcript of the call Trump had with state governors on the Monday in June after he had to scurry into his bunker when the protests got close to the White House. His disrespectful language and the daft demands for domination were typical Trump rambling. But he included Attorney General Bill Barr on that call as well, and he was explicit about what they planned to do:
[F] ederal law enforcement, working with your state and local law enforcement, to be more dynamic and to go after the troublemakers. To go after the guys that are throwing the bricks and (INAUDIBLE) … running around starting fires. They have to be taken from the street and arrested and processed. The structure we’re going to use is the joint terrorist task force, which I know most of you are familiar with. Tried and true system, it’s worked for domestic and homegrown terrorists, and we’re going to employ that model. It already integrates your state and local people and it’s intelligence driven and it will go operational.
That is exactly what they are doing in Portland, no? The only glitch is that they’re apparently detaining people without probable cause so they can’t arrest them. But what they can do is photograph them and otherwise catalog their identity, which is almost certainly a big part of the project. They are creating a database of dissidents.
Chicago may be next. According to the AP, DHS is planning to send in 150 officers to help the city with “crime,” assistance that no one has asked for and no one wants. That tracks with yet another Barr project, “Operation Legend,” announced earlier this month “to combat the disturbing uptick in violence by surging federal agents and other federal assets into cities like Kansas City, a city currently experiencing its worst homicide rate in its history.”
As this Just Security post points out, Barr has a long history of manipulating the law to put armed federal troops on the streets, and now he’s found a president who thinks that’s a great idea for his own reasons and has given him the green light. DHS is happily on board. But as Salon’s Andrew O’Hehir observed last Sunday, it doesn’t really matter what the reasons are:
The president and his sniveling retinue of “acting” factotums up and down the national security chain may not have a coherent master plan to rip out the rest of American democracy by the roots and replace it with something more to their liking. But that is unquestionably what their collective hive-mind desires, and there are people behind them, just out of view, who are willing and able to articulate such an agenda clearly. That’s generally how fascism seems to work …
Let’s face it: It would be a lot harder for Trump and Barr to pull this off if we didn’t have a massive federal police apparatus called the Department of Homeland Security in the first place. It was only a matter of time before someone used it to quell dissent. Its fascistic potential was there from the start.
Andrew Feinberg, in the UK Independent, quotes Paul Rosenzweig, who served as DHS deputy assistant secretary for policy during the Bush administration:
There were many who thought that DHS should not be created precisely because they were worried that it would be essentially an internal police force, and there were many like me, who said: “Oh, that’s absurd. Come on. You know we need a coordinated unity of effort against terrorism, and this is a good way to do it.” But there’s a lot of justice to that now.
You didn’t have to be a national security expert to see where all that was going. My mantra throughout the post-9/11 build-up of this massive surveillance and police apparatus has been, “If you build it, they will use it.” They are using it. Of course they are.
Final passage of the Homeland Security appropriations bill is coming up soon. Democrats need to put their feet down and demand that these uninvited incursions into American cities stop immediately. Beyond that, there must be a complete re-evaluation of the department, including consideration of breaking it up entirely. The country managed to function without it quite well for centuries.
The least they can do is change the name. From the moment they started talking about “Homeland Security” we knew it was only a matter of time before we’d see federal police in the streets. How could it be otherwise? The only surprise is that it took this long.

0,2020-07-22T13:11:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/robert-reich-the-real-choice-is-social-control-or-social-investment/,Robert Reich: The real choice is social control or social investment,"Some societies center on social control, others on social investment.
Social-control societies put substantial resources into police, prisons, surveillance, immigration enforcement, and the military. Their purpose is to utilize fear, punishment, and violence to divide people and keep the status quo in place — perpetuating the systemic oppression of Black and brown people, and benefiting no one but wealthy elites.
Social-investment societies put more resources into healthcare, education, affordable housing, jobless benefits, and children. Their purpose is to free people from the risks and anxieties of daily life and give everyone a fair shot at making it.
Donald Trump epitomizes the former. He calls himself the “law and order” president. He even wants to sic the military on Americans protesting horrific police killings.
He has created an unaccountable army of federal agents who go into cities like Portland, Oregon – without showing their identities – and assault innocent Americans.
Trump is the culmination of forty years of increasing social control in the United States and decreasing social investment – a trend which, given the deep-seated history of racism in the United States, falls disproportionately on Black people, indigeneous people, and people of color.
Spending on policing in the United States has almost tripled, from $42.3 billion in 1977 to $114.5 billion in 2017.
America now locks away 2.2 million people in prisons and jails. That’s a 500 percent increase from 40 years ago. The nation now has the largest incarcerated population in the world.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has exploded. More people are now in ICE detention than ever in its history.
Total military spending in the U.S. has soared from $437 billion in 2003 to $935.8 billion this fiscal year.
The more societies spend on social controls, the less they have left for social investment. More police means fewer social services. American taxpayers spend $107.5 billion more on police than on public housing.
More prisons means fewer dollars for education. In fact, America is now spending more money on prisons than on public schools. Fifteen states now spend $27,000 more per person in prison than they do per student.
As spending on controls has increased, spending on public assistance has shrunk. Fewer people are receiving food stamps. Outlays for public health have declined.
America can’t even seem to find money to extend unemployment benefits during this pandemic.
Societies that skimp on social investment end up spending more on social controls that perpetuate violence and oppression. This trend is a deep-seated part of our history.
The United States began as a control society. Slavery – America’s original sin – depended on the harshest conceivable controls. Jim Crow and redlining continued that legacy.
But in the decades following World War II, the nation began inching toward social investment – the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, and substantial investments in health and education.
Then America swung backward to social control.
Since Richard Nixon declared a “war on drugs,” four times as many people have been arrested for possessing drugs as for selling them.
Of those arrested for possession, half have been charged with possessing cannabis for their own use. Nixon’s strategy had a devastating effect on Black people that is still felt today: a Black person is nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than a white person, even though they use it at similar rates.
Bill Clinton put 88,000 additional police on the streets and got Congress to mandate life sentences for people convicted of a felony after two or more prior convictions, including drug offenses.
This so-called “three strikes you’re out” law was replicated by many states, and, yet again, disproportionately impacted Black Americans. In California, for instance, Black people were 12 times more likely than white people to be incarcerated under three-strikes laws, until the state reformed the law in 2012. Clinton also “reformed” welfare into a restrictive program that does little for families in poverty today.
Why did America swing back to social control?
Part of the answer has to do with widening inequality. As the middle class collapsed and the ranks of the poor grew, those in power viewed social controls as cheaper than social investment, which would require additional taxes and a massive redistribution of both wealth and power.
Meanwhile, politicians whose power depends on maintaining the status quo, used racism – from Nixon’s “law and order” and Reagan’s “welfare queens” to Trump’s blatantly racist rhetoric – to deflect the anxieties of an increasingly overwhelmed white working class. It’s the same old strategy. So long as racial animosity exists, the poor and working class won’t join together to topple the system that keeps so many Americans in poverty, and Black Americans oppressed.
The last weeks of protests and demonstrations have exposed what’s always been true: social controls are both deadly and unsustainable. They require more and more oppressive means of terrorizing communities and they drain resources that would ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive.
This moment calls on us to relinquish social control and ramp up our commitment to social investment.
It’s time we invest in affordable housing and education, not tear gas, batons, and state-sanctioned murder. It’s time we invest in keeping children fed and out of poverty, not putting their parents behind bars. It’s time to defund the police, and invest in communities. We have no time to waste.

But Trump, as president, has continued to promote the interests of the Trump Organization. And according to New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman, Mark Landler and Lara Jakes, Trump tried to move the British Open to his resort in Scotland.
The journalists report that in 2018, Trump asked Robert Wood Johnson — his U.S. ambassador to Britain — to “see if the British government could help steer the world-famous and lucrative British Open golf tournament to the Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland, according to three people with knowledge of the episode.” Johnson’s deputy, Lewis A. Lukens, advised the ambassador not to do it and told him that Trump’s request was unethical. But Johnson, according to the Times reporters, felt pressured and brought up Trump’s idea when he spoke to David Mundell, Scotland’s secretary of state.
“The episode left Mr. Lukens and other diplomats deeply unsettled,” Haberman, Landler and Jakes report. “Mr. Lukens, who served as the acting ambassador before Mr. Johnson arrived in November 2017, e-mailed officials at the State Department to tell them what had happened, colleagues said. A few months later, Mr. Johnson forced out Mr. Lukens, a career diplomat who had earlier served as ambassador to Senegal, shortly before his term was to end.”
The Times journalists note that Trump’s British Open request “was not the first time the president tried to steer business to one of his properties.” In 2019, they recall, “the White House chose the Trump National Doral resort in Miami as the site of a Group of 7 meeting. Mr. Trump backed off after it ignited a political storm, moving the meeting to Camp David before canceling it because of the coronavirus pandemic.”

“Mail-In Voting, unless changed by the courts, will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nation’s History! #RIGGEDELECTION,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.
“This is a flashing red light. Be prepared,” MSNBC political analyst Richard Stengel responded to the president. Dartmouth political science professor Brendan Nyhan called Trump’s commentary on mail-in voting “an unprecedented attack on the legitimacy of our electoral system by a sitting president.”
The tweet notably came after Trump, in an interview with Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that aired Sunday, said he thinks mail-in voting is going to “rig” the November election and refused to commit to accepting the results, which elicited similar concerns to his comment Tuesday.
With Trump’s latest tweet, warned BBC News correspondent Daniel Sandford, “he is preparing the rigged election narrative.”
Brian Fallon of the advocacy group Demand Justice wrote on Twitter Tuesday: “Does anyone have confidence in John Roberts and the Republican justices on the Supreme Court to not side with Trump on any election dispute that arises between now and November? If so, it is misplaced.”
Chris Lu, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center who held multiple positions in the Obama administration, pointed out to Twitter’s support staff that Trump’s tweet resembles a pair of the president’s posts from May to which the social media company added fact-check labels.
Hey @TwitterSupport, this tweet is very similar to Trump’s tweets on May 26
Your spokesperson said those earlier tweets “contain[ed] potentially misleading information…and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots”
Same should be done here https://t.co/CHKZySW0m6
— Chris Lu (@ChrisLu44) July 21, 2020
While rights advocates have long called for the expansion of mail-in voting on a national level, those demands have taken on added weight due to regional lockdowns and social distancing practices necessitated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Advocates are still pressuring the Republican-controlled Senate to urgently pass the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act, legislation approved by the Democrat-held House that included $3.6 billion in funding to help states hold fair and safe elections this year.
As advocates have ramped up their calls to expand access to the ballot during the pandemic, Trump has doubled down on his attack of mail-in voting—despite the fact that, as critics have repeatedly emphasized, the president has voted by mail himself.
“#VoteByMail is safe and secure,” tweeted Rep. Nanette Barragán (D-Calif.). “[Trump’s] attempts to mislead the American public on this are not based on facts. They are dangerous and misguided. It is #VoterSuppression during the #Covid19 pandemic.”
Author David Litt, who served as a speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, declared that “Trump’s claims around mail-in voting aren’t just false—they’re a type of election fraud,” linking to a Monday op-ed for the Washington Post in which he made that case about Trump’s earlier remarks to Wallace.
In his piece for the Post, Litt detailed Republican-led efforts in states across the country to exclude voters with purges of the registration rolls, photo identification rules, “signature matching” requirements that enable poll workers to discard ballots after they are cast, long lines, and other tactics.
According to Litt:
These actions put into context the statements made recently by Attorney General William P. Barr, and echoed by Trump, that mail-in voting will lead to foreign countries flooding our postal system with counterfeit ballots. These are not serious or good faith claims. Nor are they solely designed to cast doubt on the November elections. They are an attempt to win that election under false pretenses, by subtracting valid votes, and barring eligible Americans from the electorate.
False claims of voter fraud like the ones coming from the White House are, sadly, legal. But they are nonetheless a form of election fraud. Unlike voter impersonation or mail-in ballot malfeasance, this kind of fraud is real, it’s common, and it can change the course of our country. We should stop treating these outlandish claims as mere bluster or conspiracy theory, and start treating them as the threats to democracy they are.
Other critics of Trump have tied the president’s persistent lies about mail-in voting to what some have called “Trump’s attempted murder” of the U.S. Postal Service with sweeping changes that could slow delivery.
“REMINDER: he’s not just throwing another Twitter tantrum about this,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Calif.) said Tuesday about Trump’s tweet. “As we speak, he and the crony he installed as Postmaster General are actively destroying the #PostalService so you can’t vote by mail.”

0,2020-07-22T12:33:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/why-the-donald-trump-and-chris-wallace-spectacle-was-a-pseudo-event-design-to-fluff-a-fascist/,Why the Donald Trump and Chris Wallace spectacle was a pseudo-event design to fluff a fascist,"The boundary-breaking Nigerian author Chinua Achebe once observed: “When suffering knocks at your door and you say there is no seat for him, he tells you not to worry because he has brought his own stool.”
Donald Trump, the fire devil and chaos agent, is that trouble and the suffering which comes with it. He is not outside the door; he is firmly inside the White House — and has no plans to leave even if evicted by the voters on Election Day.
Last Sunday, Donald Trump, America’s most powerful Fox News grandpa, was interviewed on that network by Chris Wallace. The malignant reality of the Fox Universe is supposed to be a “safe space” for Donald Trump and other members of his inner circle. For an hour or so on Sunday, that would not be the case.
During his conversation with Wallace, Trump could not answer basic questions about the coronavirus pandemic and his failures of leadership and outright malevolent negligence. He appeared not to care about the 140,000-plus Americans who have died during the pandemic. He struck a pathetic note, telling Wallace that there was nothing good about his time as president, saying, “I think I was very unfairly treated. From before I even won I was under investigation by a bunch of thieves, crooks. It was an illegal investigation.”
He defended the Confederate flag, which symbolizes white supremacy and the systematic subjugation of Black people. He spun ludicrous lies about “the left” wanting to unfairly and irrationally “cancel” Columbus Day. He blathered incoherently about the New York Times’ award-winning 1619 Project, which explores the origins of American democracy and its irrevocable connections to white-on-Black chattel slavery.
Trump bragged about passing a basic test of mental competence given to screen people for Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. The test itself is intentionally easy for those who are not so afflicted. Trump found the test difficult and was proud to have passed it.
There was not much news value to the interview, beyond the fact that it happened.
As he has done ever since he became president, Trump continued to make ominous threats about not stepping down from office if he loses the 2020 election. He continued to lie about the coronavirus pandemic. He proclaimed his greatness. He continued with his casual racism and deeply ingrained white supremacy.
On a certain level, Trump’s performance was very sad. If he were capable of such an emotion, he would have been embarrassed for himself.
In thinking about Trump’s interview with Wallace, we cannot forget that Fox News is Trump and the Republican Party’s equivalent to Pravda, the Communist Party’s official newspaper in the Soviet Union. There is little if any truth to be found there.
Fox News formerly claimed to be “fair and balanced,” but perhaps now feels that claim is too clearly false. As media scholars and other researchers have shown, Fox News is a right-wing disinformation machine that willfully and consistently lies to its audience. The network is so acutely damaging to America’s public discourse that people who do not watch any news programs at all actually know more about empirical reality and current events than people who consistently watch Fox News.
Fox News advertised Wallace’s interview with Trump as “no holds barred.” Either by express or tacit agreement, that was not the case.
Wallace never asked Trump about the Russian bounties reportedly placed on the heads of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, or about the president’s apparent indifference. Trump was not asked about his personal pattern of corruption, which extends to his inner circle and his administration more generally. He was not asked about his administration’s continuing assaults on the rule of law and the Constitution, conducted with particular vigor by Attorney General Bill Barr, or about his use of a secret federal police force in Portland, Oregon, and other parts of the country.
Wallace did not ask Trump about his recent attempts to order an end to coronavirus testing, in an evident attempt to control information about the spread of the pandemic.
Wallace also did not ask Trump about his pardon of Roger Stone, an obvious mafia-style quid pro quo in which Stone was rewarded for lying about Trump in order to protect him from criminal charges related to the Russia election interference scandal and special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
Instead, Wallace allowed Trump to repeatedly claim that he was a victim of the “Russia hoax.” Wallace also praised, soothed and coddled Donald Trump throughout the interview.
We must understand that Chris Wallace is not an objective party interested in the truth about Donald Trump and what he represents. Wallace’s role is to be the “reasonable” voice of Fox News, a journalistic beard for the propaganda arm of the Republican Party and the American right-wing. Wallace’s “tough” interview is a way for Fox News to maintain some superficial credibility as a “legitimate” news outlet. Such stagecraft and optics management are common features of failing democracies and autocratic regimes.
In total, Wallace’s interview with Trump is best understood as a pseudo-event intended to make an illegitimate leader look legitimate. (“Look! The Great Leader does interviews and answers questions! He represents the will of the People!”)
Unfortunately, this interview is being celebrated in the mainstream press as a great and impossible feat, a type of gold standard for reporters and journalists going forward. It has been described as “Pulitzer Prize-worthy,” “the best interview of Donald Trump ever” and even “masterful.”
In reality, Wallace did little more than observe basic journalistic rules about pursuing the facts and asking follow-up questions. A competent high school journalist could have done the same.
In that sense, Wallace’s Sunday interview was the equivalent of a high jump competition where the bar had been laid flat on the ground. Its principal revelation was that Trump could not answer the most basic and simple questions. In essence, he simply tripped over the bar and fell flat on his face.
But Wallace’s interview with Trump matters — because the excessive praise it has received shows how low the most basic standards of mainstream journalism have sunk in the Age of Trump.
There are far too many voices in the mainstream media who, despite all the obvious evidence to the contrary, have furthered a narrative that Trump was not really a fascist and an authoritarian. In their words, he would ultimately become “presidential” and “rise to the occasion.” Nearly four years into his regime, many of those same voices cling to a hope that Trump is something other than what he repeatedly shows himself to be. In recent weeks, because of his escalating assaults on American freedom and democracy, some of these voices have finally been forced to admit that Trump is a would-be fascist dictator.
The sincerity of these analysis is undermined by their cowardice. Such reporters, journalists and other members of the commentariat are horribly late to the fight but now want to claim vanguard status — when they labored for years to normalize and enable Donald Trump.
I have previously called such people “hope peddlers” — professional “moderates” who actively avoid the truth about Trump and this era. The hope peddlers are still pushing the narrative that somehow the American people will rise and unite, Trumpism will be magically vanquished, and all will return to “normal.” The hope peddlers, for reasons both personal and professional, are desperate for a return to a status quo ante where they can sell their superficial horse-race journalism and participate in a 24/7 news cycle that routinely inflates relatively unimportant issues into massive controversies.
Faced with a profound existential crisis – and no small amount of personal risk, in a failing democracy where Trump and his right-wing allies have targeted reporters and journalists with violence – the hope peddlers have exposed themselves as mere stenographers of current events, incapable of speaking truth to power.
Denial is the unifying theme in the mainstream news media’s fundamental failure to serve as a bulwark of truth and accountability in defense of democracy during the Age of Trump.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the three basic dimensions of denial are a refusal to “acknowledge a difficult situation,” a reluctance “to face the facts of a problem” and an effort to “downplay possible consequences of the issue.”
With some admirable recent exceptions — the George Floyd protesters, anti-fascist activists, members of the Black Lives Matter movement, and other people of conscience who have resisted Trumpism and the forces behind it — the American people at large have also shown themselves to be plagued with denial.
There are slightly more than three months until Election Day. Donald Trump’s fascistic machinations are unrelenting and expanding. He has publicly stated on numerous occasions that he will not respect the outcome of the 2020 presidential election if he is defeated.
Trump is deploying his own private police force, across the United States to put “anarchists” and “radicals” — in other words, anyone who defies him — behind bars, or worse. Trump’s followers are willing to die and kill for him. Bill Barr, serving more as the president’s personal lawyer than the nation’s attorney general, is consulting with John Yoo, George W. Bush’s infamous “torture lawyer,” about how Trump can consolidate power like an emperor, bypass Congress and the Constitution, and then rule by decree.
Trump may try to use his private Gestapo to stop Black and brown people, and others who support the Democratic Party, from voting in November.
David Atkins of the Washington Monthly outlines this scenario, writing that Trump and his campaign team now understand that absent some scandal around Joe Biden, Trump’s “only path to victory lies not in persuading a majority of voters but in choosing his own electorate by suppressing the votes of the majority of Americans who despise him”:
Put all of this together, and it opens the possibility of a terrifying abuse of power. We could end up seeing armed private contractors hired by the RNC and affiliated conservative organizations to intimidate Democratic-leaning voters, bolstered by camouflage-wearing taxpayer-funded rifle-toting border patrol agents aggressively checking papers of every voter in line in the guise of “securing against voter fraud” on the president’s orders. This would be happening during the most tense presidential election in our lifetimes during a raging pandemic, often in lines in which voters must wait 8 to 10 hours to vote due to restricted polling places in minority communities — also a blatant suppression attempt enabled by the Supreme Court’s voiding of many of the protections of the Voting Rights Act. …
  The likelihood that these actions would be met with immediate enraged protest would be very high. Election Day violence unheard of since the Civil Rights era could ensue, which would give Trump an excuse to instigate further crackdowns across the country as election day continues. Federal agents could foreseeably be sent in to attempt to stop the counting of mail-in ballots in the days following the election on presidential orders. No need for a Brooks Brothers Riot if you can just send in an armed federal paramilitary, instead.
  Absent some form of preventive action by states, municipalities, the Democratic Party and left-affiliated organizations, there is very little to stop Trump, Attorney General Bill Barr and Acting DHS Secretary Wolf from attempting any or all of this.
Trump’s regime and its enforcers are preparing to push America’s democracy off a cliff and into the abyss.
It may be too late to save America from Trumpism because the state of denial lasted too long. These next few months are especially critical if the country’s democracy is to be saved and the hard work then done to heal and improve it for future generations so that another version of neo-fascism cannot emerge in the United States.
To win, good Americans must engage in collective action, corporeal politics, embodied solidarity, and what the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis described as “good trouble” to resist and defeat Trumpism. First and foremost, good Americans must vote against Donald Trump in such massive numbers that he cannot make even the most brittle claim that the election was somehow stolen or rigged against him. Such a defeat will reveal Trump as a full-on tyrant engaging in a coup, should he refuse to step down in January as the Constitution demands. The moment of reckoning is here. Will the American people rise to the occasion or once again retreat into the false comfort of denial?

0,2020-07-22T12:19:50+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/first-high-profile-republican-defection-to-biden-comes-from-swing-state-ohio/,First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio,"Ohio has burrowed itself deep in impeached president Donald Trump, who may or may not be hiding in his bunker at this time. It’s not a state that will decide the presidency. Trump won it by eight points in 2016, and if he loses it this year (and chances are growing by the day), he will already have lost Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and several other states—giving presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden more than enough electoral votes to end our long national nightmare. Yet his campaign has now made Ohio the second-largest recipient of advertising dollars, behind only Florida.
So how do you think Trump will react when he finds out that former Ohio two-term Republican governor John Kasich is scheduled to speak at the Democratic National Convention? Hilarious, right?
The Daily Beast has leaked details on Democratic plans for the mostly online convention, which includes the information on Kasich’s participation. The Associated Press has more information on the Kasich coup, and adds this hint: “Kasich is among a handful of high-profile Republicans likely to become more active in supporting Biden in the fall.” The Biden campaign, feeling secure in its base, is clearly focused on expanding his potential base of support, and the never-Trump crowd, while small, could have a big impact in close races up and down the ballot.
Ohio is a perfect example, a state in which Trump’s standing has fallen more precipitously during the coronavirus pandemic (and because of it) than most places.
As noted in a previous analysis, Trump’s general election matchup numbers are closely correlated to his approval numbers. His 47% approvals here means he’s getting between 47-49% in the head-to-head matchups versus Biden. That’s enough for victory, but barely. Trump is hanging on for dear life in a state that he comfortably won in 2016, and which shouldn’t be in play given its demographics—mostly white, mostly non-college.
Meanwhile, Kasich left office a popular politician, with a 52-36 rating the last time Quinnipiac checked in before he was termed out of office in 2018. But even then, there were storm clouds that hinted at a party split: “Ohio Gov. John Kasich gets a 52-36 percent job approval rating, doing better with Democrats than he does with his fellow Republicans, Democrats approve of Kasich 57-33 percent. Republicans are divided as 46 percent approve and 44 percent disapprove.” You see, he had run against Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, and Trump hit him for, among other things, giving his state’s residents health care via Obamacare Medicaid expansion.

The campaign eventually ended, but the feud never did. For example, here was a typical interaction between the two, in 2018:

— John Kasich (@JohnKasich) August 13, 2018
Pretty good, right? Kasich also attacked his party for looking the other way as Trump made a mockery of party orthodoxy, steel and aluminum tariffs, as well as for tolerating Trump’s attacks on national institutions like the FBI and the Justice Department. After the 2019 Dayton mass shooting, Kasich called Trump “sensitive” and “thin-skinned.”
Kasich spent some seconds this year “running against Trump in the GOP primary,” but no one took that seriously. The Republican Party is the Party of Trump, and vice versa. There’s no longer any room for Kasich-style moderate fiscal conservatives in the GOP. We don’t want them either! But at least this year, those never-Trumpers realize the damage that Trump is doing to the country. As Kasich told the Washington Post, “[The Republican Party] coddled this guy the whole time and now it’s like some rats are jumping off of the sinking ship. It’s just a little late. It’s left this nation with a crescendo of hate not only between politicians but between citizens. … It started with Charlottesville and people remained silent then, and we find ourselves in this position now.”
Kasich may be the highest-profile Republican to flip to Biden right now, but there is definitely something happening among Republicans. Look at Trump’s approval ratings among Republicans:
So 87-9 seems ridiculously high, right? Except that during the impeachment hearings, that number was 91-6. That means that in just a few short months, Trump has lost a net-seven points of support among Republicans.
Don’t scoff. Every Republican that gives up on Trump is one less vote. They may vote for Biden and say the heck with it, they’ll vote for Democrats in critical Senate and House races. Or maybe they stay home in frustration, which is almost as good.
Every Republican defection makes it harder for Trump to bounce back. How is he going to expand his coalition if he can’t even hold on to his own core base?
Kasich isn’t a play to win Ohio. We don’t need Ohio. Let Trump piss his money away on a state that is irrelevant to whether he wins or loses. While there are two Republican-held House seats that could be in play, control of the U.S. House isn’t at stake.
But there are Republicans who aren’t happy being associated with a racist sociopath who is putting our children at risk to boost his reelection chances, and Kasich is a signal to them freeing them from Trumpism. There are alternatives. Because this thing, whatever it is that Republicanism has become? It really hasn’t quite worked out well for the country now, has it.
But even if Kasich doesn’t swing a single vote—which is quite possible—the inevitable Trump tantrum will be reason enough to stand up and clap. You know it’ll be glorious.

“No,” McConnell said after letting out what Politico reporter Jake Sherman, who posed the question, described as a “big laugh.”
The $600-per-week increase in unemployment benefits provided under the CARES Act have served as both a lifeline for tens of millions of laid-off Americans and a significant cushion for the U.S. economy.
For weeks, economists and lawmakers have warned that letting the benefits lapse, even for a short period of time, could have devastating effects on those close to the brink of financial ruin. According to Census Bureau data, more than 13 million Americans who live in rental housing were behind on rent payments as of July 7.
“I have a bill to renew supercharged unemployment benefits until this crisis is over so families can continue to pay rent and buy groceries,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) tweeted Tuesday. “Senate Republicans have had every opportunity to pass it and have refused to do so.”
While the enhanced unemployment benefits officially expire on July 31—a Friday—in effect the $600 weekly payments are set to end on either Saturday, July 25 or Sunday, July 26, the days states will send out the last boosted checks.
“Thirty million workers won’t be able to pay rent on August 1st and McConnell is laughing,” said Wyden spokesperson Ashley Schapitl.
Bobby Kogan, a mathematician for the Senate Budget Committee, tweeted that “there is no excuse” for allowing the enhanced benefits expire.
“We had months to get this done, and the House passed its bill back in May,” wrote Kogan. “Tens of millions of people will be harmed because of the cavalier inaction of Senate Republicans.”
Ha ha ha so funny that millions of Americans are going to lose the only lifeline they have, the bottom from our economy will fall out, and Congress can’t get its shit together to do anything about it.
Get to work. https://t.co/RulHBzWOlh

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) laughed Tuesday when a CNN reporter asked whether Congress would be able to reach a deal on coronavirus relief legislation by the end of this week—an even more daunting timeline than the one put to McConnell given the deep divisions roiling Senate Republicans and the White House, not to mention fundamental disagreements between the GOP and their Democratic counterparts.
“The end of the week? You mean the month,” Pelosi responded. “I’m hoping for the end of the month.”
In May, the Democrat-controlled House passed legislation that proposes extending the $600-per-week boost in unemployment insurance (UI) through January of next year.
In an interview Tuesday evening with CNN‘s Wolf Blitzer, Pelosi said Republicans “have had plenty of time to be thinking about this and this delay is unnecessary because, by the end of July, unemployment benefits will expire… a moratorium on evictions will expire—many things will expire that are addressed in our legislation.”
The Washington Post reported Tuesday that negotiations over the relief bill are “likely to spill into August,” leaving both chambers with little time to pass legislation before summer recess. Pelosi said last week that she would “absolutely” be willing to cancel recess to pass relief legislation; McConnell has not said the same.
“Republicans do appear to be gravitating toward a proposal on what to do about the expiring unemployment benefits,” the Post reported. “Democrats have proposed extending those benefits through January, but the White House and some Republicans now want to cut the extra benefits to about $200 per week. Democrats haven’t agreed to this, however.”
During a private meeting on Monday, according to the Post, “Trump criticized the enhanced unemployment benefit, saying it never should have been agreed to in the first place.” Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly characterized the boosted unemployment payments as “disincentives” to work.
Ernie Tedeschi, a former Treasury Department economist, noted in a series of tweets Tuesday that contrary to the narrative pushed by the GOP and the White House, “there’s no evidence in the data that emergency UI has been a net drag on the labor market so far.”
Allowing the benefits to expire, warned Tedeschi, “would be devastating to individual families, as well as to regional economies in aggregate.”

Matt Gaetz caught ‘improperly’ funneling taxpayer money to ex-Trump aide ousted in racism scandal: report,"Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) has been caught breaking House ethics rules by funneling taxpayer money to a private speech-writing consultant who also happens to be a scandal-plagued former aide to President Donald Trump.
Politico reports that Gaetz’s office improperly sent $28,000 in taxpayer money to a limited liability corporation linked to Darren Beattie, a Trump aide who was ousted in 2018 after it was revealed he spoke at a conference featuring several prominent white nationalists.
Politico notes that “House rules explicitly prohibit spending taxpayer dollars on speech-writing consultants,” although Gaetz’s office tells the publication that this was the result of a “clerical error” that it is working to correct.
In an additional potential violation, Politico found that Gaetz has built a taxpayer-funded television studio in his father’s house that he uses for television appearances.
“Taxpayers foot the bill to rent the television camera, and the private company that built the studio — which Gaetz refuses to identify — takes a fee each time he appears on air,” Politico writes. “It’s unclear how much it cost the private company to construct the studio… This may run afoul of the House gift rule, which prohibits any lawmaker, aide, and their family members from accepting gifts worth more than $50.”
Gaetz is claiming that the TV studio was approved by the House Ethics Committee, although he declined to provide any documentation to back up this claim.

We’ll start with a look at the state House, which Republicans flipped in 2010 and have held ever since in large part thanks to an aggressive gerrymander. Republicans currently enjoy a 110-93 edge (Daily Kos Elections assigns any vacant seats to the party that last held them), so Democrats need to net nine seats this year in order to win their first majority in a decade. Members serve two-year terms, and every seat is up this fall.
Back in 2016, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton 48-47 statewide and took 119 of the 203 districts. Two years later, though, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey was re-elected 56-43 against Republican Lou Barletta and carried all 83 of the Clinton seats and an additional 36. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, who won 58-41 against Republican Scott Wagner in 2018, took a total of 132 House districts, including each of the Clinton/Casey constituencies.
There are six House Republicans in Clinton/Casey/Wolf districts. An additional 25 Republicans represent Trump/Casey/Wolf seats, while 10 more hold Trump/Barletta/Wagner districts. Altogether, there are 41 Republicans in seats that backed at least Wolf, which could give Democrats plenty of targets in a strong year.
On the other side, 10 Democrats serve in Trump/Casey/Wolf seats. Another three hold Trump/Barletta/Wolf constituencies, while two are in Trump/Barletta/Wagner districts.
We’ll turn now to the Senate, where half of the 50 seats are up in presidential cycles and the rest are on the ballot in midterm years. The Republicans have held the chamber since the 1994 elections, and they got some very welcome news last year when state Sen. John Yudichak announced that he was leaving the Democratic Party and would instead caucus with the GOP as an independent.
The GOP coalition now holds 29 seats, while Democrats control the remaining 21. If Team Blue can net four districts this fall, then Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman would be able to break ties in favor of his party.
Clinton won 23 seats in 2016, while Casey and Wolf carried 31 and 34, respectively. Just like in the House, Casey won all the Clinton districts, while Wolf in turn took all of Casey’s seats.
Of the 25 seats that will be on the November ballot, 15 are held by Republicans and the remaining 10 are in Democrat hands. (Yudichak is not up again until 2022.) Two of these Republicans hold Clinton/Casey/Wolf seats, another two are in Trump/Casey/Wolf districts, while an additional pair represent Trump/Barletta/Wolf constituencies.
Two Democrats, meanwhile, are defending Trump/Casey/Wolf seats this fall, while the party’s other eight seats each backed Clinton, Casey, and Wolf. One of that pair of Democrats is Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, who faces no GOP opposition. The other is state Sen. Pam Iovino, who flipped her seat 52-48 in a competitive special election that took place last year.
Finally, we’ll take a quick look at the 2018 gubernatorial and Senate elections for the state’s 18 congressional districts. Casey took Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick’s 1st District and Republican Rep. Scott Perry’s 10th District, which are both major Democratic targets this fall, as well as the nine Democratic-held seats. Wolf won all those plus Republican Rep. Mike Kelly’s 16th District, which so far hasn’t attracted too much national attention.

We’re also issuing a new rating in an eighth race, the all-Democratic general election for California’s 53rd Congressional District. You can find all our Senate, gubernatorial, and House ratings at each link.
• AK-Sen (Safe R to Likely R): While Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan is still the favorite in conservative Alaska, he’s not looking as secure as he did only a few months ago.
The first public poll of the race, an early July survey from the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, showed Sullivan leading orthopedic surgeon Al Gross, an independent who is seeking the Democratic nomination, just 39-34, and had Trump up 48-45. Local pollster Alaska Survey Research more recently followed with considerably better numbers for Sullivan, putting him ahead 53-40, but that same poll also found Trump in front by a just 49-48 margin. While they differ on the battle for the Senate, both polls portend the closest presidential race in the Last Frontier since 1968.
That close fight at the top of the ticket complicates matters for Sullivan, and while Gross begins with little name recognition, he does have the resources to get his name out in this inexpensive state. The challenger outraised Sullivan $1.5 million to $1.2 million during the second quarter of 2020, and though Sullivan still ended June with a $5.4 million to $3.2 million cash-on-hand lead, Gross has the funds needed to run a credible campaign. A Gross victory would be a major upset, but there’s enough uncertainty to put this one on the big board.
• MO-Gov (Safe R to Likely R): While every poll we’ve seen has found Republican Gov. Mike Parson leading Democratic state Auditor Nichole Galloway, a trio of recent surveys suggest the contest has grown closer. A mid-June poll from the Republican firm Remington Research for the Missouri Scout newsletter showed Parson up 50-41, while a Galloway internal from Garin-Hart-Yang conducted two weeks later had the governor ahead 47-40. An early July poll from YouGov for St. Louis University, meanwhile, had the incumbent leading by a tiny 41-39.
Missouri has shifted hard to the right over the last two decades, but recent polls show Trump only narrowly ahead—or even losing—in a state he took 56-38 four years ago. Parson has also earned poor marks for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, with 48% of respondents approving and an equal proportion disapproving in YouGov’s poll. (By contrast, most governors have seen their ratings soar.) That view seems unlikely to change soon: As cases have spiked in his state, Parson has scoffed at mask wearing and insisted that kids who contract the disease would “get over it.”
It would still be a huge shock if Democrats win in the Show Me State, but thanks in part to her opponent’s stumbles, the electoral math now appears to offer a path for Galloway in a way it simply did not just a few months ago.
• AR-02 (Safe R to Likely R): Republican Rep. French Hill turned back a credible challenger by a fairly modest 52-46 margin last year, and he once again faces well-funded opposition in this 52-42 Trump seat in the Little Rock area.
State Sen. Joyce Elliott raised $600,000 during the second quarter of the year, which was more than her total haul over the previous two quarters, while Hill took in only $270,000. The incumbent still enjoys a wide $1.5 million to $719,000 cash-on-hand lead, but Elliott, who would be the first Black person to represent Arkansas in Congress, has the resources to get her message out.
• CA-53: (Safe D: No Favorite): In past cycles, we’ve issued ratings for general elections that feature two members of the same party, and we’re doing that again for the all-Democratic contest for this seat in the San Diego area. Right now, though, there’s no obvious frontrunner in the contest between former State Department official Sara Jacobs and San Diego City Council President Georgette Gómez.
Jacobs, who unsuccessfully ran in the nearby 49th District last cycle, took 29% of the vote in the early March top-two primary, while Gómez beat out a Republican 20-13 to earn the second place spot. There hasn’t been any polling since then, though. Gómez, who identifies as “a queer Latinx” and would be the first LGBTQ Latina to serve in Congress, has the backing of a number of local elected officials and unions, and she ended June with a $265,000 to $138,000 cash-on-hand lead. The wealthy Jacobs, though, has already self-funded close to $3 million, so it’s very unlikely she’ll be outspent in the fall.
• CO-03 (Likely R to Lean R): Republicans have decisively won every contest in this western Colorado seat over the last decade, but businesswoman Lauren Boebert’s shock primary win over Rep. Scott Tipton complicates things for Team Red.
Boebert has made news by expressing sympathy for the bonkers QAnon conspiracy theory, which should give Democrats more of an opening than they would have had against the relatively conventional Tipton. Boebert has also been a weak fundraiser so far, trailing Democrat Diane Mitsch Bush in cash-on-hand $202,000 to $10,000 on June 30 (the fundraising quarter ended the night both women won their primaries.)
However, thanks to the district’s lean, even Boebert begins the general election with the advantage. Trump carried it 52-40 in 2016, and two years later, Republican Walker Stapleton took it 50-46 even as he was losing his bid for governor 53-43 statewide. However, Boebert’s upset win introduces a whole lot more unpredictability into the race, and that’s not a good thing at all for Republicans.
• PA-01 (Likely R to Lean R): Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick looked like the heavy favorite to hold this 49-47 Clinton seat in the Philadelphia suburbs after the two most prominent Democrats dropped out of the primary, but that’s begun to change. In June, Democrat Christina Finello and her allies at House Majority PAC each released surveys that showed her in a tight race with Fitzpatrick, with Joe Biden far ahead in this suburban Philadelphia district despite Clinton’s narrow margin here four years ago.
The incumbent finally responded last week with a poll of his own that had him ahead 53-39—though it, too, showed a big swing towards Biden. On Tuesday, Fitzpatrick’s allies at the Congressional Leadership Fund also released their own survey from the American Viewpoint that showed him ahead 50-35. That poll memo didn’t include presidential numbers, though, which can only mean they were not good for Republicans.
Fitzpatrick ran well ahead of the GOP ticket in both his 2016 and 2018 races, though if Trump bombs here in the fall, as he looks wont to do given the district’s affluence, that could finally spell the end for the congressman. And while the incumbent still has a massive financial edge, Finello’s $328,000 haul during the second quarter suggests her fundraising may at last be on the upswing. Fitzpatrick still has the edge, but the headwinds are blowing straight at him.
• TX-22 (Lean R to Tossup): This historically red open seat in Houston’s southern suburbs has been trending sharply to the left during the Trump era, and Trump’s weak position in Texas means that this shift is likely to continue this fall.
Team Blue is fielding a strong candidate in Sri Preston Kulkarni, who ended June with a hefty $1.2 million on-hand, while Republican Troy Nehls has struggled with fundraising and found himself almost penniless after a costly runoff. Still, Nehls’ position as sheriff of Fort Bend County, which makes up over 60% of this district, does give him a solid geographic base that could help him run ahead of Trump—something he’ll almost certainly need to do to win.
• TX-24 (Lean R to Tossup): This open seat, which is located in the suburbs north of Dallas and Fort Worth, is another ancestrally Republican district that has become competitive turf over the last few years. And with Trump in especially bad shape in well-educated and diverse constituencies like this, Republicans are going to need to work hard to stop their slide here.
The only poll we’ve seen here was a mid-June DCCC survey that showed Candace Valenzuela, who won the Democratic nomination last week, ahead of Republican Beth Van Duyne 45-39 as Biden led by the same margin. Just as notably, Republicans haven’t countered with contradictory numbers. However, this area remains home to many voters who still back Republicans down the ballot, which could help Van Duyne prevail even if Trump loses the seat. Van Duyne and Valenzuela have also raised a similar amount of money so far, and we see this race as anyone’s to win.

0,2020-07-22T11:17:38+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/church-that-defied-covid-19-shutdown-order-by-holding-indoor-services-received-federal-ppp-loan/,Church that defied COVID-19 shutdown order by holding indoor services received federal PPP loan,"As Daily Kos previously covered, a small number of churches in California are fighting back against Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recent shutdown order as the state experiences a fresh surge in coronavirus cases. The latest order directs some counties to shutter malls, nail salons, gyms, and houses of worship. As covered Monday, some California churches are continuing to hold indoor services in spite of the new guideline. A federal lawsuit has even been filed.
The latest news, as reported by The Sacramento Bee, is that Destiny Christian Church, a nonprofit, in Rocklin, California, received a federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan of between $350,000 and $1 million in April, according to records. (Disclosure: Kos Media received a Paycheck Protection Program loan.)
What makes this notable? After all, we know that a number of religious organizations actually received more than $7 billion in PPP loans overall. This figure includes more than 9,000 Catholic churches (out of the 12,000 that applied), as well as megachurches with more than 10,000 constituents a piece.
The Bee reports, according to the PPP database, the church requested the federal loan to cover payroll for 140 employees, and that it’s listed as awarded on April 8, which, for perspective, is just several days after the first loans from the CARES Act were available.
In addition to defying state orders, Pastor Greg Fairrington of Destiny, gave a Sunday sermon this weekend in which he brought up the “benevolent” government; or rather, a lack thereof. “If you think the government is going to be benevolent to the church, if you believe that, you just haven’t studied history,” the pastor asserted, as reported by the Bee, adding, “because once your rights are taken from you, they’re never giving them back.”
As for Sunday’s services, Fairrington told local outlet KTXL Fox 40 he held three services on Sunday, each with 375 people inside at one time. According to Fairrington, the church can hold 1,500, but they reduced the capacity to allow for social distancing. The church also appears to offer online services on its website.
Mind you, according to Newsom’s recent order, indoor worship services are supposed to be entirely suspended in select counties as virus numbers surge in some counties. Fairrington posted a Facebook video on July 13 (the day of Newsom’s order), where he stated: “We are not shutting down the church. We will be having church on Sundays.” He added: “My mandate, as a pastor, is to obey the word of God,” and that, “we are not gonna allow a government to use data that is not supported, factually, to shut the church down.”
The Bee reports it received a statement from a church spokesperson on behalf of Fairrington, saying Destiny applied for a PPP loan “to protect our employees, who provide critical care and support to the community.” Then: “The Sacramento Bee’s pursuit of this article, and the reality that it’s written 3 divisive stories in less than 10 days, suggests that it’s [sic] desired outcome is to vilify a religious establishment that only seeks to do good in its region.”
Speaking to KTXL, Fairrington argued: “Church is essential.” For many people, that certainly may feel true, which is why it’s so encouraging to see many religious leaders turn to 100% virtual services amid the global health crisis.

0,2020-07-22T11:11:47+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/republicans-fighting-internally-on-covid-19-relief-as-financial-crisis-looms-for-millions/,Republicans fighting internally on COVID-19 relief as financial crisis looms for millions,"The next phase of coronavirus relief is a moving target bogged down in demands from the White House, Sen. Mitch McConnell’s obsessions, and vulnerable Senate Republicans’ fears. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he’s looking for a deal by the end of next week, but Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows says that’s too soon. Meanwhile, expanded unemployment insurance (UI) benefits, the $600/week boost, expires this weekend. Rent is due in 10 days.
Trump is still obsessing about his payroll tax holiday and no more funding to states for coronavirus testing and contact tracing. McConnell still wants to tie state and local funding to school reopening and to absolve all businesses and schools from liability for future coronavirus infections and deaths they might cause by prematurely reopening. He is declaring it will have $105 billion to school reopening, another tranche of funding to the troubled Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), another round of direct payments to individuals, and some form of aid to businesses to beef up safety procedures to reopen. (Disclosure: Kos Media received a Paycheck Protection Program loan.) Because just giving everyone enough money to live on and keep their businesses solvent so they can stay safely at home and flatten the COVID-19 curve is too “socialist,” apparently.
The White House has apparently realized that the politics of the payroll tax cut are bad when it comes to Social Security since that would mean a cut in funding to the trust fund, so they are now talking about making it even worse by structuring it as a deferral rather than a cut. Which would mean people who still have jobs and are still on payrolls would see a larger paycheck now, but would have to pay it back later. That could be waived by Congress, and almost certainly would be waived by Congress, which would mean we’re back to Social Security being harmed. Even Republicans remain cool to this idea of Trump’s because even they realize that you don’t get any economic stimulus out of a payroll tax cut when tens of millions of people are not on a payroll. There’s a fight between Senate Republicans and the White House on this. Mnuchin told reporters Monday night that it was already in the bill. McConnell said “we’re all going to be discussing it.”
Republican leadership, however, doesn’t seem to be entirely united on what McConnell wants, particularly when it comes to state and local aid that their own constituents need. Those running for reelection need to be spending the August recess talking about how much money they secured for their states, like Sen. John Cornyn from Texas, who told The Wall Street Journal that the bill is likely to have that funding because House Democrats have prioritized it. “I do believe there will be something in there,” he said, since Speaker Nancy Pelosi had made clear “that’s a red line for her.”
Senate Republicans are also pushing back against Trump’s efforts to stop money for testing. “To open schools, we need more tests,” Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander from Tennessee pointed out. “We ought to provide whatever financial support we should to make it safe for schools to open and that includes widespread testing.” The same goes for money to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which Trump is trying to stop—including funding for vaccine distribution. “The vaccine is not very good if it’s not properly distributed,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican and chair of the Appropriations Committee’s health panel.
There will be more relief, albeit late and inadequate. The House-passed HEROES Actmfrom way back in May should be the floor for a relief package at $3 trillion. The $1-ish trillion they’re talking about now is going to be woefully underfunded, though at least it doesn’t do harm.
There’s consensus in direct payments, though McConnell will fight to impose income limits on eligibility. There will almost certainly be an extension of expanded UI benefits, though probably not at $600 a week. Which means the country is going to limp into fall, and the election, barely surviving. That’s unless Trump decides to blow it all to hell and veto this bill because it doesn’t have a payroll tax cut or eliminate his hated CDC. That’s not outside of the realm of possibility, though it’s not likely. Even he is smart enough to know that he can’t kill everyone off and have a chance at winning in November.

Brad and Nancy Nadeau, the owners of Stars and Stripes Brewing, told the Bangor Daily News on Tuesday that they were alerted to the facts from a campaign news release calling them the “first stop” for a “Women for Trump” bus tour that will cross a few states in the northeast, ending in New Hampshire two days after it begins.
“The Nadeaus said on Tuesday they had initially been told that some members of the campaign were going to come in for a beer while getting pizza from an adjacent restaurant,” the report explained. “Brad Nadeau said he was told late Monday that Lara Trump, the Republican president’s daughter-in-law, would be there and reporters may come as well, but he did not know it would be a formal event.”
Understandably they came under a deluge of negative comments from folks in the area wondering why the Nadeaus’ brewery was a Trump hot spot. He called the campaign to cancel the event, noting that their business does not host political events or endorse candidates.
Brad Nadeau is a Marine veteran who served in the Iraq War and he has been willing to host charitable events for causes, but not for political campaigns.
“I tried so hard to keep this brewery positive, and we haven’t had any backlash because we don’t do anything that’s negative,” he told the Daily News. “But when it comes to politics, people are so far on either side.”
No one seems to know whether Lara Trump will move the rally to another location or how they’ll proceed. Mercedes Schlapp, Katrina Pierson and Pam Bondi were all names cited as headliners of the event along with many Maine Republicans, except, of course, Sen. Susan Collins, who is barely holding onto her Senate seat in the state.

The Camden County Sheriff’s Office asked the state bureau to investigate “based on allegations made against William ‘Roddie’ Bryan, Jr.,” the GBI tweeted Friday. “The investigation is active and ongoing.”
Ben Crump, an attorney representing Arbery’s family, said in a tweet Friday that Bryan, who also faces a charge of criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment in Arbery’s case, was denied bail. “We must keep the pressure ON and get #JusticeforAhmaud,” Crump said.
The video Bryan captured shows the moments leading up to Arbery’s death on Feb. 23 in the Satilla Shores neighborhood, which is in South Georgia. Arbery was allegedly jogging when former cop and prosecutor’s investigator Gregory McMichael and his son Travis McMichael hunted him down, accused him of trespassing onto the site of a home under construction, and killed Arbery. Bryan and the McMichaels were arraigned in court Friday in Brunswick, and they all pleaded not guilty, according to Channel 2 Action News.
William “Roddie” Bryan Jr. was denied bond today! We must keep the pressure ON and get #JusticeforAhmaud We cannot let the McMichaels and Bryan get away with the murder of #AhmaudArbery!! For more details: https://t.co/i3OXUaeumK #SayHisName #RunWithMaud #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/LgoYz01fRJ
— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) July 17, 2020
Bryan’s attorney Kevin Gough, made his client’s case for bail before court Friday to News 4 Jax. “Keeping him in jail isn’t accomplishing anything,” he said. “Roddie is struggling in there. He’s not used to being in jail. He lost his house, his car, his job and everything, everything he has left in the world is in storage. If he can get back out, he can reclaim his life.”
Assistant District Attorney Jesse Evans said during court the sex crimes investigation only “heightens the risk of flight” in Bryan’s case, and Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, made a similar plea, News 4 Jax reported. “Each time I visit there, I fear running into either man who killed my son,” she said. “William Bryan does not feel he did anything wrong. What is to stop him from doing it again?”
Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley ultimately denied Bryan’s bail as well as a motion requesting District Attorney Joyette Holmes be taken off the case, and another calling for a gag order, News 4 Jax reported. Marcus Arbery Sr., Ahmaud Arbery’s father, applauded the court’s decision in a statement Crump tweeted on behalf of Marcus Arbery. “Bryan knowingly participated in the lynching of Ahmaud Arbery by documenting his murder, making it impossible for him to escape, and doing nothing to stop his murder,” he said in the tweet.
Marcus Arbery added: “I suffered the deepest loss a father can endure when the McMichaels, with the knowing participation of William ‘Roddie’ Bryan jr., acted as my son’s judge, jury and executioners.”
Crump also praised Holmes in his statement as a “deeply experienced” and “excellent choice to prosecute this case.” She is the first Black woman to serve as Cobb County’s district attorney, and she was appointed to the Arbery case after a prosecutorial misconduct investigation was announced for two other Georgia prosecutors. A special prosecutor also stepped away from the case that took 74 days to even produce an arrest.
“It’s ironic that the defendants are asserting their innocence and enjoying the American right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty,” Crump said. “Because they denied Ahmaud Arbery that basic right by presuming him guilty based on the color of his skin and ending his life.”

0,2020-07-22T10:28:54+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/did-feds-provide-personal-security-for-st-louis-couple-who-brandished-guns-at-peaceful-protesters/,Did feds provide personal security for St. Louis couple who brandished guns at peaceful protesters?,"The white couple from Missouri who were caught on camera brandishing firearms at Black Lives Matter protesters walking in front of their mansion last month have been charged with felony unlawful use of a weapon, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner said Monday.
Gardner announced the charges against local plaintiffs’ attorneys Mark and Patricia McCloskey in a statement alleging that the “disturbing” event had endangered “peaceful, unarmed protesters.”
“It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in nonviolent protest,” she said.
“We must protect the right to peacefully protest,” she added, “and any attempt to chill it through intimidation will not be tolerated.”
Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson told a local St. Louis radio station Friday that he would pardon the couple, a promise he repeated to Fox News host Sean Hannity after news of charges broke.
“Without a doubt, Sean,” Parson said when asked about a potential pardon. “I will do everything within the constitution of the state of Missouri to protect law-abiding citizens. And those people are exactly that — they are law-abiding citizens. And they’re being attacked, frankly, by a political process that’s really unfortunate.”
Parson added that it was a “sad day” for his state. The governor, who is seeking election this fall, also said President Donald Trump had agreed in a call that the McCloskeys should not face charges.
“They had every right to protect their property, their home — just like any of us would,” Parson said. “If you had a mob coming towards you, whether they tore down a gate or not, when they come on your property, they don’t have a right to do that in an aggressive manner. And people have a right to protect their selves, their families, their property.”
Hannity then asked Parson about information he had gleaned from “a source” claiming that federal authorities had helped protect the McCloskeys’ property when a group returned to protest July 3 outside of their home.
“I had a source telling me that when the protesters went back to the McCloskeys’ home that there was no local police present,” Hannity said. “But the president had sent in some support. Is there any truth to that?”
Parson did not say one way or the other whether the federal government had afforded the McCloskeys what would amount to a personal security detail. But he did confirm that he had spoken with the president about what to do in the event of charges.
When protesters returned to the McCloskey manse July 3, “more than a dozen men in plain clothes walked the grounds and peered out from a second-floor balcony of the couple’s home,” the Associated Press reported.
In a call with Salon, Patricia McCloskey declined to comment on Hannity’s comments regarding federal “support.” Patricia McCloskey said she had not yet seen the broadcast and would need to consult with her husband before responding.
The McCloskeys’ attorney, Joel J. Schwartz, initially told Salon twice in a phone conversation that Hannity’s claim was accurate: Federal agents had, in fact, provided security at the couple’s home.
Schwartz, who said he was “disheartened” by the felony charges, also told Salon that Mark McCloskey had personally arranged for additional security. He said that the McCloskeys needed the support, because they had received threats.
After telling Salon he would ask Mark McCloskey for more details, Schwartz changed his story, writing in a text message: “I do not have any information regarding who contracted for security at their home.”
“The federal government did not procure security for him,” Schwartz added.
However, when asked whether the federal government had provided security, Schwartz said he did not know and would not comment. Given multiple opportunities, Schwartz did not deny the claim.
In a follow-up call with another journalist from Salon, Patricia McCloskey declined to comment.
“I thought I put a call block on this,” she said.
A spokesperson for the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department told Salon that it had monitored the July 3 protest but “cannot confirm who was on their property.”
The charges against the McCloskeys come after a lengthy joint investigation between Gardner’s office and the SLMPD, throughout which the McCloskeys have gone on a media blitz in what appears to be an effort to drum up support from Trump and his allies in conservative circles.
The McCloskeys took part in a virtual Trump campaign event Friday night, where they were interviewed by Kim Guilfoyle, the romantic partner of the president’s eldest son and a senior campaign official. Guilfoyle tested positive for COVID-19 on July 4.
“I thought I was going to die,” Mark McCloskey told Guilfoyle, describing the initial protest.
“I thought that within seconds we’d be overrun, they’d be in the house, they’d be setting fires, they’d be killing us,” he added.
Patricia McCloskey said the couple had called St. Louis police before arming themselves, but authorities said they received no such call, local CBS affiliate KMOV reported.
Reached for comment for this article, a spokesperson for Parson’s office referred Salon to the governor’s Twitter statement about Gardner’s charging decision.
Gov. Parson, who was previously sheriff of Polk from 1993-2004, has long been at odds with Gardner, the city’s top prosecutor and a Democratic elected official. In 2018, Gardner, who is Black, dropped invasion of privacy charges against Parson’s predecessor, former Democratic Gov. Eric Greitens, in exchange for his resignation amid fallout from an extramarital affair.
Parson, who had been elected lieutenant governor, now faces his first gubernatorial election in November. The former small-town sheriff has made it known that he plans to run on a law and order platform, and he has enlisted Trump and Attorney General William Barr as allies.
Earlier this month, Parson sent Barr a letter requesting federal assistance to combat a spate of violent crime in St. Louis, unbeknownst to the city’s mayor, who only learned of it later via Twitter.
Parson told Hannity on Monday that Trump had already sent more than 200 FBI agents to the state to help combat violent crime.

0,2020-07-22T01:47:21+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-sickening-greed-of-health-care-corporations-rages-while-a-pandemic-spreads/,The sickening greed of health care corporations rages while a pandemic spreads,"Sometimes I don’t know whether to weep uncontrollably, laugh hysterically or just throw up.
I recently did all three when I came across yet another outbreak of sickening greed pouring out of America’s corporate executive suites during today’s raging health crisis. What made this one especially nauseating was that the perpetrators are honchos of major health care corporations!
Leading this greed brigade is Larry Merlo, CEO of our country’s largest drugstore chain, CVS. While much of our economy has been shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic, this billion-dollar giant has customers surging in to get everything from medications to masks. Yet, in this time of great need, the boss and the board of CVS have blithely presided over scenes of chaos in many of their stores, which have been so severely understaffed that they pose a danger to public health.
The chain’s pharmacists tell of frantically scrambling to keep up with filling prescriptions, answering ever-ringing phone inquiries, giving shots and COVID tests, stocking toilet paper, tending the drive-through, etc. — while also having to meet ceaseless corporate demands for cost-cutting and more profit. The result has been a dangerous work overload, with many pharmacists handling nearly 200 prescriptions in a nonstop, six-hour shift, about one every two minutes. Unsurprisingly, there’s been an alarming rise in serious errors and weeklong delays in providing critical medications for customers. The New York Times reports that one CVS pharmacist has no control over staffing, and even the chain’s district leader has no power to make changes.
So, not only does the buck stop at the top but so does a big chunk of the corporate bucks. While CEO Merlo has failed to fund the staff his pharmacies and the public clearly need, he has generously funded his own needs … and then some. He paid himself $36.5 million last year alone. Then there is the mountain of interest payments and fees that CVS is paying to Wall Street bankers and lawyers who engineered Merlo’s monopolistic deal to take over the Aetna health insurance giant last year.
So, while you’re being underserved at a local CVS, just remember that Boss Man Merlo and his merger mercenaries are making a killing. How comforting is that?
The holy mantra of health professionals was coined about 2,500 years ago by the Greek physician Hippocrates: “Do no harm.”
Of course, that was before corporate health care took charge and a new paramount ethic was engraved on America’s big chain hospitals: “Jack up profits.” To see it in action, check out the COVID money grab and executive greed being exhibited by the largest and richest hospital baronies. A New York Times analysis of the finances of 60 highly profitable, deep-pocketed giants — such as HCA, Tenet, and Providence — revealed that they had rushed to the front of the pandemic bailout line this spring to pull $15 billion from the government’s emergency fund. They pocketed the taxpayers’ money despite sitting on tens of billions of dollars of their own cash reserves.
But hold your nose, for it gets much stinkier. These bailout allotments were supposed to keep hospital workers on the job, yet the wealthiest chains promptly hit nurses, janitors and other crucial frontline staffers with layoffs, pay cuts and deadly shortages of protective gear. For example, HCA, the behemoth worth $36 billion, snatched a billion-dollar taxpayer bailout for itself and then demanded that its nurses and low-paid staffers accept wage freezes, elimination of company pension payments and other cuts … or it would eliminate thousands of jobs.
But wait: HCA’s chief exec, Samuel Hazen, suddenly showed solidarity with lowly workers by donating $237,000 (two months of his reported $1.4 million salary) to a worker support fund. How magnanimous! But wait again. Hazen’s generosity is a deception, not a sacrifice. The trick is that a CEO’s “salary” is a miniscule part of total pay. His annual bonus, stock payouts and other compensation raise his actual yearly haul to $26 million! So his donation is less than 1% of his pay, and he almost certainly will write that off his income taxes. So we taxpayers (including the nurses and others he’s knocking down) not only underwrite his fat take-home but also subsidize his face-saving philanthropic gimmick.
Meanwhile, having endangered and infuriated HCA’s workforce, Hazen has launched “a new line of business”: an HCA subsidiary to hire and train hospital strikebreakers. To entice scabs, he offers a $150 “Show Up” bonus and — get this — a continental breakfast!
What we have here is a raging virus of executive-suite greed doing deeper damage to our society than COVID-19 ever could.

Federal officials in Portland have prompted a fierce backlash for aggressive and legally dubious tactics against protesters in the city. Local officials have demanded that the federal officials, some of them using unmarked vehicles and wearing camouflage without identifying insignia, leave and let police handle law enforcement. But President Donald Trump and Wolf seem intent on using the Homeland Security forces to intimidate, rough up, and apprehend protesters to make the federal government appear tough.
And while he was speaking to Fox Host Martha MacCallum on Tuesday, Wolf seemed to confirm what many had accused his agency of doing: making unlawful arrests.
“The department, because we don’t have that local support, that local law enforcement support, are having to go out and proactively arrest individuals,” Wolf said. “And we need to do that because we need to hold them accountable. This idea that they can attack federal property and law enforcement officers and go to the other side of the street and say ‘you can’t touch me’ is ridiculous.”
Watch the clip below:
Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wold says the actions of his department in Portland are “proactive” arrests of individuals and argues that his stormtroopers aren’t bound by the physical jurisdiction of federal property. pic.twitter.com/tIkcSTSmKf
— nikki mccann ramírez (@NikkiMcR) July 21, 2020
By saying that his officers are proactively arresting people, Wolf suggests that they’re making arrests before people have committed crimes. This, of course, would be an unlawful arrest — you can’t arrest someone just because you think they might commit a crime.
Some could argue this is an unfair reading of Wolf’s remarks because his remarks referred to people who committed crimes, such as assaulting federal officers. The problem is that there have been multiple incidents of federal officials sweeping people off the streets despite no clear evidence or reason to believe they were involved in a crime. One person, Mark Pettibone, was reportedly detained by agents and eventually released without ever being charged with a crime.
So the seemingly “unfair” reading of Wolf’s remarks actually seems to accurately reflect what is happening on the ground in Portland.

These days, I hear the sound of that horn while walking with my kids through the streets of New York City, while protests continue here, even amid a pandemic, as they have since soon after May 25th when a police officer put his knee to George Floyd’s neck and robbed him of his life. I hear it when I speak with homeless leaders defending their encampments amid the nightmare of Covid-19. I hear it when I meet people who are tired, angry, and yet, miraculously enough, finding their political voices for the first time. I hear it when I read escaped slave and abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass’s speech on the eve of the Emancipation Proclamation.
I also feel Frederick Douglass’s sharp reminder, from that same speech, of the need for eternal vigilance when I learn of the death of leaders in the movement to transform this world of ours — like Pamela Rush, who lived in the Mississippi Delta with raw sewage in her yard and died from Covid-19 complications, the closest hospital being nearly an hour from her home. (She leaves behind a daughter who needs a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine to breathe and a son.) These are, after all, times of staggering danger, but also enormous possibility, moments that should be met with unbridled imagination, absolute seriousness, and the music of those jubilee horns. Above all, in a world distinctly stacked against us, we must believe that we can succeed.
¡Sí, se puede! Yes, we can!
How to Heal America
On June 20th, I distinctly heard that sound of the jubilee horn, when nearly three million people tuned in for the Mass Poor People’s Assembly and Moral March on Washington to express the untold stories, demands, and potential solutions of a growing social movement to a host of injustices. Alongside social media, radio, and TV (in English, Spanish, and American Sign Language), toll-free numbers broadcast the program to homeless encampments and other places abandoned by much of this society long before Covid-19 hit, and 300,000 listeners sent the agenda of the Poor People’s Campaign to their governors and Congress.
Meanwhile, that very day in Tulsa, Oklahoma, President Trump was speaking at a rally in which he trafficked, as he always does, in explicit racism and hate even as he denied the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis it has induced. Only about 6,000 people sat largely maskless and shoulder to shoulder in that auditorium, which could have held 19,000. They nonetheless seem to have helped spark a surge in coronavirus cases in that city about two weeks later.
Also on June 20th, the Poor People’s Campaign (of which I am a co-chair) launched a “Moral Policy Agenda to Heal America: The Poor People’s Jubilee Platform.” It detailed not just a list of demands, but a blueprint for the moral reconstruction of a society that now looks to be failing fast. It’s meant to remind us all that ending poverty and systemic racism, working to mitigate climate change, and halting this country’s ever-growing militarism, at home and abroad, is not only possible, but that we essentially know what it will take to get us there. Among the policies needed are universal single-payer healthcare, quality and free education through college, debt relief, a guaranteed income, the right to a living-wage job, true environmental protections, indigenous and immigrant rights, and an adequate standard of living for all, including the poor, in a country with a Congress and president focused mainly on the rich and on funding the Pentagon at ever more staggering levels.
This Jubilee Platform, as we call it, affirms many of the truths discovered by freedom-fighters across the ages — including the well-kept secret in America that there is actually enough for everyone and that all of us are deserving of our nation’s abundance; that when we lift from the bottom up, everyone rises; that our society desperately needs a moral revolution of values for which we’ll have to depend on the leadership of those most impacted by injustice; and that, as Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., once suggested, we truly “can force the power structure to say yes when they may be desirous of saying no.”
There Need Be No Poor Among Us
Many people have said that this platform is far too ambitious, that such demands are both politically inconceivable and ridiculously too expensive. Don’t believe them. Instead, believe me that the benefits of investing in life, not death, far outweigh the costs, whatever they may be.
After all, child poverty already costs our country, at a minimum, an estimated $700 million annually; voter suppression in just one state, Florida, added up to at least $385 million annually in administrative and court costs; failing to adequately address climate change and create a genuine green economy could, in the end, cost an estimated 15.7% of our gross domestic product a year, wiping out the equivalent of $3.3 trillion from our economy — and, if the effects of climate change arrive more quickly than expected, it could be worse. Meanwhile, endless wars, not to speak of the 800 U.S. military bases scattered across the planet, cost hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars a year without making our country or the world any safer.
Instead of bankrolling war and the military-industrial complex, Americans could swiftly cut $350 billion from the annual Pentagon budget, use it to enhance genuine security at home (particularly during this pandemic), and still have a larger military budget than China, Russia, and Iran combined. The government could raise the federal minimum wage to a living one and experience a ripple effect as that money circulated back through the economy, both faster and further than the billions Congress has given through tax cuts to the already immensely wealthy and corporations. And the U.S. could gain $886 billion in estimated annual revenue from fair taxes on that 1% of Americans, the most powerful corporations, and Wall Street.
Imagine a society that truly began to invest in public infrastructure, creating ever more and better jobs not related to the military-industrial complex, while accelerating a clean energy transition (and the jobs that went with it). Imagine what that would do for our country and the planet. In the process, the United States could provide health care, housing, and education for everyone. In the richest country in the world, there are, in reality, abundant resources, even if for far too long our public policies have funneled far too much to far too few.
Jubilee and Justice
The inclusion of jubilee in that policy platform is not meant as just another rhetorical flourish. It is meant as a rallying cry, a word that captures in the best possible way a future economic and social vision of justice, a political roadmap for our moment, and an expression of the moral heart of movements of the oppressed in this country. Indeed, jubilee has often been invoked as a shorthand for the promise of freedom in this country, from the pre-Civil War abolition movement to today.
On December 28, 1862, on the eve of the moment when President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves, Frederick Douglass gave a speech, “The Day of Jubilee Comes” that he began this way: “This is scarcely a day for prose. It is a day for poetry and song, a new song.” He then warned, however, that it was unwise “for the friends of freedom to fold their hands and consider their work at an end. The price of Liberty is eternal vigilance.”
Two and a half years of death and struggle later, on June 19, 1865, the Union Army arrived in Galveston, Texas, and the enslaved people of that city — the last to do so — learned that they had been emancipated. The memory of that day has since held special meaning for many Black communities, as well as others seeking freedoms of various sorts. Some know it as Juneteenth. Others call it Jubilee Day.
In my 25 years of grassroots anti-poverty organizing, from homeless encampments to welfare offices, we’ve declared jubilee countless times, whether from crushing debt and family separation or inadequate housing and healthcare systems. An understanding of what jubilee means, and the hope it represents, has always been grounded in a study of history and theology.
I’m a minister and teach in a theological seminary, so I couldn’t be more aware that “jubilee” appears throughout the Bible, including in the law codes of Deuteronomy, the most cited Old Testament book. Those codes established a covenant with God in which there was to be an unbroken cycle of jubilee years when debts were cancelled, slaves manumitted, wages finally paid, the poor and hungry given provisions, and farm land allowed to lie fallow (an early form of ecological conservation). Together, those codes served as sacred law and the people were told that, if they were followed, “there need be no poor people among you.”
None of those laws were meant to be about charity, but about the responsibilities of a land and a people. They amounted, in fact, to a call for a radical reconstruction of society. It was no accident, in fact, that the first mention of jubilee came two books earlier in Leviticus in a similar set of liberatory codes handed down by God after the Jewish people had been freed from Egypt. They were to provide a clean break with the hellish world those Jews had just escaped and the first building-blocks of a new, more just one.
What does all this have to do with the United States today? For one thing, even before Covid-19 hit, there were 140 million poor and low-income people in the richest country in the world, the richest country, in fact, in history and one in which inequality has risen to levels not seen in a century. Meanwhile, wages for most workers have been stagnating for decades and, in the Covid-19 moment, historic rates of unemployment hit, along with the threat of a massive wave of evictions amid a widening economic crisis. In addition, over the past few decades, poverty has become an increasingly endemic and permanent fixture of American life.
In that context, it should be obvious that the United States is in dire need of a new vision.
The Day of Jubilee Is Coming
The problems of 2020 clearly demand a jubilee vision for the nation, something that, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations, feels more possible now than it has for generations. Reverend William J. Barber II, my Poor People’s Campaign co-chair, often says that we are on the cusp of a Third Reconstruction (after the post-Civil War one and the Civil Rights Movement). In each of those previous periods, monumental social, political, and economic changes were birthed by movements in the midst of insufferable conditions and in the face of regressive governments.
The last few months offer evidence that growing segments of society — if not the Trump administration and various Republican state governments — are willing to imagine bold solutions to issues like poverty and systemic racism and are prepared to organize what could be a new reconstruction to make them a reality. Six months into the pandemic, tens of thousands of Americans are continuing to go on rent strikes and engage in the struggles of low-wage workers and the unemployed demanding both immediate relief and permanent rights to housing and decent work at a living wage.
Those in a revitalizing labor movement are taking increasingly militant action, including the national Strike for Black Lives on July 20th by low-wage workers. Meanwhile, this summer’s racial justice uprisings have awakened one of the largest protest movements in American history, while transforming the conversation on previously untouchable institutions like the police and the military. An unprecedented debate has now opened up about how society spends its resources and why politicians have invested so much money in social control and violence, while gravely underfunding the cornerstones of a healthy society: education and environmental protection, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and food and water supplies, among other things.
The nation’s misplaced priorities are not only damaging the social fabric, but moving us toward a fundamentally unstable economy in which only the truly wealthy will truly prosper. Beneath the often-detached waves of the stock market is a roiling ocean of troubles: more than 80 million people uninsured or underinsured, for instance, within the most expensive healthcare system among developed countries. In 2019, 137 million Americans faced financial hardship thanks to high medical costs and rising debt. Meanwhile, the Pentagon awarded Boeing roughly the same amount in annual military contracts as it would cost to expand Medicaid in the 14 states that have yet to do so.
In America, scarcity is a myth and nothing more. The money is there to be found and, during a pandemic, it needs to be. Last summer, the Poor People’s Campaign and the Institute for Policy Studies released a “moral budget” outlining where this country’s abundant resources have been so disastrously funneled and how they could be redirected toward the rest of us.
Where would such moneys go? Toward making a reality of what the Constitution has always promised: establishing real justice (the right to democracy and equal protection under the law), promoting the general welfare (the right to an adequate standard of living), ensuring domestic tranquility (the right to work with dignity), securing the blessings of liberty (the right to health and a healthy environment), and providing for the common defense (reprioritizing our resources to defend life over profit and our real security over that of the national security state).
To do this, the nation would need to enshrine education, healthcare, housing, and welfare as universal rights; raise wages, while creating new labor standards and encouraging the right to unionize and organize; demilitarize the economy and our communities; protect the vote, not the gerrymander, while investing in democracy, not incipient Trump-style autocracy; forgive debts, rather than improving the ability of banks to collect them; declare climate change a national emergency; and invest in infrastructure while building a fully green economy.
Social movements, especially when first gaining ground, are often told to be “practical,” to make their demands few and modest. It’s worth noting, though, that the same is never asked of the super-rich, of the 1%, certainly not in the financial crisis of 2007-2008 when Wall Street was bailed out to the tune of nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars, nor in the current crisis when Congress’s stimulus package to date has largely amounted to an even greater giveaway program. A jubilee platform is not a proposal to tinker around the edges. It is a plan for reconstruction that hopes to address the pain and hope of millions fighting every day simply for the right to live. The project of reconstructing society around the needs of the poor and dispossessed requires a movement led by those most impacted by the economic and racial disasters of our time.
When We Lift from the Bottom, Everyone Rises
I have been engaged in a movement to reconstruct society led by the poor and dispossessed for more than a quarter of a century. In that time, many have come forward to claim that ending poverty is impossible, that this is as good as it gets, that the costs of addressing inequality are simply too great. Especially in my role as a member of the ordained clergy and a biblical scholar, rarely has a week passed that I haven’t heard someone quote a line from Jesus in the Bible — “the poor will be with you always” — to make the point that humanity has always known poverty to be eternal and that its mitigation is best reserved for charity or philanthropy. Indeed, that biblical passage has become yet another tool wielded by supporters of the wealthy to deflect attention from systemic failures in our country and help them further consolidate their power — to reinforce that social uplift is far too costly to imagine and change of that sort inconceivable.
In a blistering new report on the growing crisis of global poverty, Phillip Alston, the former U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, explained the consequences well: “The overwhelming success of the ideological campaign that supports neoliberal policies is that it has succeeded in convincing people that those in poverty have no one to blame but themselves, while supporting the notion that trickle-down policies will address it.”
We may live in a time that essentializes poverty, but the irony of that line from the Bible on the poor is that Jesus was actually critiquing it (and the rich) by cleverly referencing the law codes of Deuteronomy. In his time, the Roman Empire had created a society rife with suffering and death, as well as its own predatory regime of wealth accumulation. Jesus references perhaps the most powerful prescription for justice in the Old Testament with the message that “there need be no poor people among us” and instructs nations to forgive debts, pay people what they deserve, abolish slavery, and organize society around the needs of the poor. That jubilee passage of his was never actually saying that poverty was inevitable, but that the “poor will be always with us” as long as we cater to the rich rather than build a society that cares for everyone. That’s no less true today.
May we choose another way.

0,2020-07-22T00:32:22+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/time-is-not-on-our-side-in-libya/,Time is not on our side in Libya,"Ahmed, who lives in Tripoli, Libya, texts me that the city is quieter than before. The army of General Khalifa Haftar—who controls large parts of eastern Libya—has withdrawn from the southern part of the capital and is now holding fast in the city of Sirte and at the airbase of Jufra. Most of Libya’s population lives along the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea, which is where the cities of Tripoli, Sirte, Benghazi, and Tobruk are located.
Haftar, who was once an intimate of the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is now prosecuting a seemingly endless and brutal war against the United Nation’s recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli and led by President Fayez al-Sarraj. To make matters more confusing, Haftar takes his legitimacy from another government, which is based in Tobruk, and is formed out of the House of Representatives (HOR).
Ahmed says that the quiet is deceitful. Militias continue to patrol the streets along the Salah al-Din Road near where he lives; the rattle of gunfire is anticipated.
On July 8, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres made a statement that could have been delivered at any point over the last decade. “Time is not on our side in Libya,” he announced. He laid out a range of problems facing the country, including the military conflict, the political stalemate between the GNA and the HOR, the numbers of internally-displaced people (400,000 out of 7 million), the continued attempts of migrants to cross the Mediterranean Sea, the threat from COVID-19, and the “unprecedented levels” of “foreign interference.”
The UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution to send a Fact-Finding Mission to Libya to investigate human rights violations in this war, including the mass graves found in Tarhouna. The credibility of the Council is in doubt. An earlier Commission of Inquiry on Libya set up in 2012 to study war crimes in 2011-2012 was shut down largely because the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) refused to cooperate with the investigation. A second inquiry, set up in March 2015, closed its work in January 2016 with the political deal that created the Government of National Accord.
Guterres did not mention the NATO war in 2011. I am told that he wants to appoint a joint Special Representative with the African Union and he would like a full review of the UN mission. All that is well and good; but it is short of what is necessary: an honest look at the NATO war that broke the country, fomenting a conflict that seems without end.
Foreign Interference
Statements about Libya drip with evasion. These terms—“foreign interference” and “foreign-backed efforts”—are dropped into conversations and official statements without any clarification. But everyone knows what is going on.
I ask Rida, who lives in Benghazi (now under the control of General Haftar), what she makes of these phrases. “We all know what is going on,” she tells me via text. “The government in Tripoli is backed by Turkey and others; while Haftar is backed by Egypt and others,” she writes.
At the core, she says, this is a dispute between two regional powers (Turkey and Egypt) as well as a contest between the Muslim Brotherhood (Turkey) and its adversaries (Egypt and the United Arab Emirates). Wrapped up in all this are contracts for offshore drilling in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, which additionally involved Cyprus and Greece.
It is not enough that this is a regional conflict. There is accumulating evidence that General Haftar is being supported by armed mercenaries (from Russia and Sudan) and by arms shipments from France, while the United States seems to have hedged its bets with support to both sides in the conflict.
Last year, General Haftar’s forces moved swiftly toward Tripoli, but were eventually rebuffed by the intervention of Turkey (which provided the Tripoli government with military aid as well as Syrian and Turkish mercenaries).
In late December, Turkey formally signed a military and security agreement with the Tripoli-based GNA, which enabled Turkey to transfer military hardware. This agreement broke the terms of the UN resolution 2292 (2016), recently reaffirmed in UN resolution 2526 (2020). Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have openly been supplying Haftar.
Now, the forces of the Tripoli government have moved to the central coastline city of Sirte, which has emerged as the key hotspot in this contest.
The Tobruk government, which backs General Haftar, and a pro-Haftar tribes council urged Egypt’s General Abdul Fatah El Sisi to intervene with the full force of the Egyptian armed forces if Sirte falls to the Turkish-backed government. Egypt’s military drill—called Hasm 2020—came alongside the Turkish navy’s announcement of maneuvers off the Libyan coast—called Navtex.
This is a most dangerous situation, a war of words escalating between Turkey and Egypt; Egypt has now moved military hardware to its border with Libya.
Oil
Of course, oil is a major part of the equation. Libya has at least 46 billion barrels of sweet crude oil; this oil is highly valued for Europe because of the low costs to extract and transport it. Countries like the UAE, which are pushing the embargo of Libyan oil, benefit from the withdrawal of Libya, Iranian, and Venezuelan oil from already suppressed world oil markets. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) has stopped oil exports since January; from about 1.10 million barrels per day, Libyan oil production fell to nearly 70,000 barrels per day.
Neither Haftar nor the Government of National Accord in Tripoli can agree on the export of oil from the country. Oil has not left the country for the better part of the past six months, with a loss—according to the NOC—of about US$6.74 billion. General Haftar controls major oil ports in the east, including Es Sider, and several key oil fields, including Sharara.
Neither side wants the other to profit from oil sales. The United Nations has intervened to try and resolve the differences, but so far there has been limited progress. The entire conflict rests on the belief that either side has that it could win a military victory and therefore take the entire spoils; no one is willing to compromise, since any such agreement would mean a de jure partition of the country into its eastern and western halves with the oil crescent divided between the two.
Demilitarized Zone
UN Secretary-General Guterres has surrendered to reality. In his recent statement on Libya, he listed a series of “de-escalation efforts, including the creation of a possible demilitarized zone”; this “demilitarization zone” would likely be drawn somewhere near Sirte. It would effectively divide Libya into two parts.
Neither Ahmed nor Rida would like their country to be partitioned, its oil then siphoned off to Europe, and its wealth stolen by oligarchs on either side. They had misgivings about Muammar Qaddafi’s government in early 2011; but now both regret the war that has ripped their country to shreds.

0,2020-07-22T00:09:17+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/2020-primaries-have-had-plenty-of-problems-but-one-easy-solution-has-been-overlooked/,2020 primaries have had plenty of problems — but one easy solution has been overlooked,"As 2020’s pandemic primaries continue into mid-July, there has been a recurring pattern of poll worker shortages, last-minute poll closures and ensuing congestion for in-person voting—even as record numbers of voters cast mailed-out ballots in those same states.
Yet one relatively inexpensive countermeasure has not yet been widely used to smooth polling place voting, at least not yet, due to a mix of administrative hurdles and partisan obstruction. That remedy is drop boxes—akin to mailboxes—that can safely and securely accept and hold hundreds to several thousand ballot envelopes.
“We do think that states should be deploying more of these,” said Matthew Weil, director of the Election Project at Washington’s Bipartisan Policy Center. “It is a good policy solution, even in the best of times. It could be even more impactful now during the pandemic.”
“They are especially important in states that require mail ballots to be at election offices by close of polls, and states that do not pay for return postage,” said Hillary Hall, senior adviser to state and local election officials at the National Vote at Home Institute, which recommends one box for every 10,000 to 20,000 voters.
Recent and upcoming primaries are illustrative. In Texas’s low-turnout July 14 primary runoff, there were few positive notes about the in-person voting experience, according to the election protection briefing that day by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
“Despite countless letters and meetings with civic groups warning election administrators about poll worker shortages, very few counties have adequately prepared for this inevitability, and the state took no efforts to help,” said Mimi Marziani, Texas Civil Rights Project president, whose opening remarks at the briefing noted last-minute poll closures in San Antonio, Fort Worth—“all in communities of color.”
“All due to a completely foreseeable lack of poll workers,” she said, noting 68,000 Texans were diagnosed with the virus between July 2 and the July 14 election. “Instead of dealing with it, the governor exempted polling places from mask rules.”
One exception was Harris County, where Houston is, and “where officials have expanded vote-by-mail drop off locations throughout the county for the first time,” she said. “For the most part, you are seeing in our big urban counties officials who are trying to do the right thing.”
“The 11 locations are our headquarters and our 10 annex locations,” said Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins. “The cost of this was near-zero, since we utilized staff that were already at those locations to accept the ballots.”
The use of 11 drop-off sites—allowed under Texas law—didn’t prevent in-person voting delays everywhere in Houston, a city of 4 million. But their use highlights an emerging trend: At the level where elections are administered, usually by county officials, there is some discretion to implement nuts-and-bolt steps like deploying drop boxes or ballot-acceptance sites. But doing so more widely in urban population centers remains a challenge.
Michigan
Consider the biggest city in the pivotal swing state of Michigan, which will hold state primaries on August 4. This July, commissioners in Wayne County—where Detroit and smaller cities are located—passed a resolution to deploy 60 drop boxes across the county to save voters time, postage and avert mail delays for the November 3 election.
After the July 4th holiday, Detroit officials arranged for two boxes to be set up for August’s vote.
“At first, we had no way for voters to drop off their ballots at any locations,” said Commissioner Monique Baker McCormick, D-Detroit, who sponsored the resolution to expand their use. “Now we have two. The city clerk in Detroit just installed one last week, for approximately 500,000 folks that potentially vote; that are registered to vote. We need more than just the two boxes.”
The county commission resolution doesn’t appropriate money—roughly $2,000 for each box. Baker McCormick was hoping that the state Bureau of Elections, which requested $11.2 million in federal CARES Act funds, would pay for it.
But Jan BenDor, a former election official who heads the Michigan Election Reform Alliance (MERA), said that the state’s Bureau of Elections has been offering to use CARES Act funding to pay for one drop box for each of Michigan’s 1,500-plus election jurisdictions. That approach sounds equitable, but in practice she said it helps white rural areas and hurts black cities.
“This creates massive inequity for Detroit’s 480,000 majority Black voters,” BenDor’s press release said. “By contrast, the combined 480,000 registered voters in Michigan’s smallest jurisdictions will receive a combined 624 drop boxes… There are 137 jurisdictions with fewer than 500 registered voters.”
“Detroit’s Black population has been disproportionately harmed by COVID-19,” she said. “Providing enough drop boxes to all Black voters in the City of Detroit a safe, contactless option to vote absentee, is a matter of fairness as well as public health.”
Just as the resolution by Wayne County Commissioners was part of an ongoing political process, where it offers guidance but the county’s municipal governments ultimately will decide what to do—how many drop boxes are sought and applying for the subsidies—Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said the state’s use and allocation of CARES Act funds is also a layered and evolving process.
“Currently the Bureau of Elections is doing a number of things through $2 million of the CARES funding Michigan was allocated to provide election-related equipment to jurisdictions, including offering every jurisdiction a drop box for November, though part of that allocation also allows for jurisdictions to purchase more drop boxes if they want,” Wimmer said via email.
“While that may seem to be more advantageous to rural areas, a number of other allocations of our CARES funding, including the $1.5 million in grant funding for a 50 percent match for jurisdictions to purchase things like high-speed tabulators and software, or $2.2 million for PPE [personal protective equipment], is being disproportionately utilized by areas with larger populations,” she continued. “This is all to say that the ‘advantages’ balance each other out, and the Bureau has been working directly with clerks to assess their needs and provide these allocations based on their feedback.”
An Emerging Pattern
From a national perspective, there seems to be an emerging pattern of using the federal subsidies to buy—or deploy—one ballot drop box per election jurisdiction. That administrative decision has partisan implications, as lower-population rural counties are dominated by Republican voters while higher-population urban counties are Democratic epicenters.
The highest-profile political campaigns know this—and how drop boxes can translate into more votes being cast and counted in the fall.
In Pennsylvania on June 29, the Republican National Committee and President Trump’s re-election campaign sued the Democratic Secretary of the Commonwealth, Kathy Boockvar and 67 county election boards, among other things, seeking to limit drop box deployment this fall. The federal lawsuit, among its claims about how the state illegally used drop boxes in its June 2 primary, contends that the drop boxes should be inside government buildings where they can be monitored and secured from tampering.
Outside these two swing states, however, many GOP-led states have filed reports with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which is administering the CARES Act funds, saying that they have or will buy drop boxes, as well as use the funds for “security and training” surrounding the boxes, and related transport and personnel costs. In other words, relying on drop boxes in a pandemic is seen by the GOP as a commonsense solution in red majority states.
“In the end [of the June 9 primary], more voters were issued ballots than for any other primary in state history,” said Brian Newby, North Dakota’s state election director, in its EAC report. “More than 80 percent were returned by mail or to drop boxes.”
But the fine print in these reports also shows the one-box-per-jurisdiction allocation, which helps rural voters but isn’t sufficient for the state’s urban centers.
As Nebraska’s EAC report said, “The state purchased a secure drop early ballot drop box for every county that did not have one in order for voters to securely drop off their ballot even though county offices were closed due to COVID-19.”
North Dakota and Nebraska election officials did not respond to requests to comment. And in other potential swing states, such as Ohio, Republicans are seeking to limit their usage to one site per county, which is typically the county building housing the election department.
“On March 25, 2020, the Ohio General Assembly passed H.B. 197, which… requires [county election] boards to have a secure receptacle outside the office for the return of ballots,” Ohio’s EAC report said, referring to a GOP-drafted law that restricted voting option in its primary.
A Second Look in a Pandemic?
There is no single solution that will make voting go smoothly in the general election in an unprecedented pandemic where the volume of COVID victims keeps rising. Of the two-dozen reports filed with the EAC documenting CARES Act spending thus far, half are from Republican election officials endorsing their use.
But consider their cost and the complexity surrounding their deployment compared to the staffing of every in-person voting site—which will still be needed by people with disabilities and those who do not receive their mail-in ballot on time.
As Indiana’s EAC report noted, the state spent $1.7 million on personal protective equipment for its 92 counties in its June 2 primary, including “5,000 gallons of hand sanitizer with 10,000 refillable dispenser bottles, 300,000 pairs of disposable gloves, 200,000 ear loop face masks for staff, 3,100 sneeze guards, 70,000 microfiber disinfectant cloths, and 10,000 spray bottles for voting machine sanitation… and over 26,000 posters with CDC guidelines were distributed to each county in order to keep staff mindful and vigilant.”
Nonetheless, when asked if ballot drop boxes have been used widely enough thus far in 2020’s pandemic primaries, the National Vote at Home Institute’s Hillary Hall replied, “In short, no. Drop boxes are a critical component of a vote at home system, as they often are the primary way that voters return a ballot they’ve received in the mail.”
But Hall said that local election officials typically have the discretion and authority to deploy drop boxes, because they are part of the infrastructure not regulated by state laws.
“Most state law is silent on the matter of using drop boxes,” she said. “Absent law that specifically states how mail/absentee ballots must be returned, a jurisdiction should be allowed to use them, as well as any other tool in their toolkit to help voters cast their ballots safely this November.”
On July 15, the Michigan chapter of All Voting is Local held a telephone press briefing where health professionals urged election officials to “do everything in their power” to protect the health of voters in the upcoming August 4 statewide primary and this fall. The physicians, nurses and others in the briefing called for pre-paid postage for mail-in ballots, expanded early voting and satellite polling locations and hours, and increased sanitation and personal protective equipment standards for poll workers and in-person voters.”
The Michigan Election Reform Alliance’s BenDor said more drop boxes would relieve the pressure on election officials and lessen congestion at the polls.
“MERA estimates that Detroit would need 30 to 40 secure, high-quality, preferably drive-up drop boxes for adequate coverage,” she said. “Other large jurisdictions like the cities of Flint, Pontiac and Inkster, would need additional drop boxes to meet the same 12,000 to 15,000 registered voters per box standard.”

Ashley MacLeay, a member of the D.C. State Board of Education and the granddaughter of a former Metropolitan Police Department officer, said in her time on the board children have brought “knives, guns and other deadly weapons to schools.”
”In fact, just a couple months into my term, a Black 3-year-old brought a gun into a school and it was found none other, but than by an SRO,” he said referring to a school resource officer.
She added: “It’s well-known that at least one school east of the river, that known gang members and human traffickers, a.k.a. pimps, hang out during school because members of this board have chose to ignore [it].”
Markus Batchelor, the board member who introduced the resolution MacLeay so vehemently opposed, said the woman was in effect “weaponizing a Black 3-year-old.” “When schools that I represent were categorized as havens for weapons trafficking and pimps, they’re pulled out of a deep, age-old book that, quite frankly, has allowed the state and decision makers to dehumanize and attack the lives and humanity and freedom of Black people for 400 years,” Batchelor said.
MacLeay, who made the reprehensible comments during a virtual school board meeting, also accused her peers of trying to “capitalize” on the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody May 25. Floyd, a Black man, begged for an officer who kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes to spare him. “I can’t breathe,” he said in what ultimately proved to be his last words. MacLeay, however, disregarded the man’s death as “an incident that took place half a nation away.”
Alex O’Sullivan, a student member on the District of Columbia board, called the woman’s comments “the most disgusting things I’ve ever heard.” “She made a comment about George Floyd’s killing being half a nation away. But this is not half a nation away to Black people everywhere in the United States. This is personal,” O’Sullivan said.
MacLeay stood by her words in a later statement to the DCist. “I stand behind everything I said and believe removing SROs will lead to a marked increase in violence. An increase in violence will mean families will speak with their feet,” she wrote. “Those who can will move out of the city. Those who can’t will, unfortunately, pay the price.”

0,2020-07-21T23:38:58+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/john-lewis-didnt-just-change-laws-he-changed-hearts/,John Lewis didn’t just change laws. He changed hearts,"Of all the tributes that have been written about Representative John Lewis since his passing over the weekend, the one that stood out to me came from Michael Fletcher, who said that “I didn’t understand John Lewis at first.”
My apprehension was rooted in the mistaken notion that Lewis was not angry enough. Why did he not demand revenge for the unspeakable racism he fearlessly confronted? How could he accept an apology from former Alabama governor George Wallace, a longtime segregationist who ordered the infamous Bloody Sunday attack on the bridge? Or forgive the pathological Bull Connor, the former public safety commissioner in Birmingham, Alabama? Why would he forge a relationship with former Klansman Elwin Wilson, who was part of a mob that in 1961 beat down Lewis and other Freedom Riders outside the whites-only waiting room at the Rock Hill, South Carolina, bus station?
But over the years my ambivalence melted into reverence as I came to better appreciate the power of Lewis’ grace. It armed him with undeniable moral authority that allowed him to change minds, and hearts. His willingness to forgive, along with his bravery and contempt for injustice were among the sturdiest pillars of his greatness.
The names George Wallace and Bull Connor are known to most of us with at least a passing acquaintance with this country’s history. But in case you haven’t heard about Elwin Wilson, Lewis told that story during a discussion with Barack Obama and a group of young men involved with the My Brother’s Keeper program. It came in response to the question, “In what way can being controversial be a benefit and a disadvantage?” Lewis talks about his experience with Elwin Wilson at the 4:13 mark in this video.
Wilson was one of the Klansman who beat Lewis during a stop on the Freedom Rides. But when, years later, he expressed remorse for what he had done, Lewis forgave him. Here’s what the congressman wrote at Wilson’s passing.
Elwin Wilson experienced what Martin Luther King Jr. told all of us that “hate is too heavy a burden to bear”. He demonstrated the power of love and the effectiveness of non-violent direct action not only to fix legislative injustice but to mend the wounded souls in our society, the soul of the victim as well as the perpetrator.  Elwin Wilson shows us, that people can change, and when they put down the mechanisms of division and separation to pick up the tools of reconciliation, they can help build a greater sense of community in our society, even between the most unlikely people.  Elwin Wilson proves that we are all one people, one family, the human family, and what affects one of us affect us all.
Fletcher’s initial misgivings about Lewis reminded me of something Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote about Martin Luther King, Jr. just after the election of Barack Obama in 2008.
Here is where Barack Obama and the civil rights leaders of old are joined — in a shocking, almost certifiable faith in humanity, something that subsequent generations lost. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. may have led African Americans out of segregation, and he may have cured incalculable numbers of white racists, but more than all that, he believed that the lion’s share of the population of this country would not support the rights of thugs to pummel people who just wanted to cross a bridge. King believed in white people, and when I was a younger, more callow man, that belief made me suck my teeth. I saw it as weakness and cowardice, a lack of faith in his own. But it was the opposite. King’s belief in white people was the ultimate show of strength: He was willing to give his life on a bet that they were no different from the people who lived next door.
There are still those today who question the use of nonviolent civil disobedience, especially during an era when Donald Trump and his enablers are threatening to not only roll back the gains made during the Civil Rights Movement, but are threatening the very foundation of our democratic republic. That is primarily because the current crisis makes it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain that “certifiable faith in humanity” that Coates wrote about.
The truth is that there were multiple elements of the Civil Rights Movement that can be credited with bringing about the end of Jim Crow laws. There was the pride and fearlessness that spread from people like Malcolm X and the Black Panthers. There was the coalition that began to develop in Chicago under the tutelage of Fred Hampton. But take a look at how David Remnick told the story of what happened on the bridge in Selma over 50 years ago.
Given one minute to disperse by the troopers, Lewis had the protesters kneel in prayer. They would not leave. “And then they were upon us.” The troopers charged, and the first among them brought down a nightstick on the left side of Lewis’s skull. His legs gave way. “I really thought I was going to die,” he said. He curled up on the ground, as he had been trained, in a “prayer for protection” position.” The trooper hit him again. And then came the canisters of tear gas. His skull fractured, his coat a mess of mud and blood, Lewis refused to go to the hospital. Barely conscious, he reached Brown Chapel, the headquarters of the movement, ascended to the pulpit, and told those gathered, many of them still gasping from the tear gas, “I don’t know how President Johnson can send troops to Vietnam. I don’t see how he can send troops to the Congo. I don’t see how he can send troops to Africa, and he can’t send troops to Selma, Alabama. Next time we march, we may have to keep going when we get to Montgomery. We may have to go on to Washington.”
That night, an audience of forty-eight million people watched a fifteen-minute report on Selma. President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had urged civil-rights leaders to force his hand if they wanted him to support a voting-rights bill, now saw that it was time to promote one. On national television, he compared Selma to Lexington and Concord as a “turning point in man’s unending search for freedom.” And the Voting Rights Act—now under assault in many ways—became law.
In words that were partially prophetic, a beaten and bloodied John Lewis was already talking about the “next time we march.” That is why, after all of the tributes, this is the image that brought me to tears at the passing of a truly great man.
John Lewis was willing to literally put his body on the line to live out the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.
The backbone of any commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience is a belief that the conscience of the community can be aroused. That’s why Coates referred to it as “an almost certifiable faith in humanity.” I can’t imagine a more courageous act. But John Lewis and many who joined him weren’t going to be satisfied with changing the laws. He thought that the power of love could “mend the wounded souls in our society, the soul of the victim as well as the perpetrator.”
There is a word in South Africa that captures that spirit—Ubuntu. Here is how Barack Obama described in at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela.
He not only embodied Ubuntu; he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailor as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion, generosity and truth. He changed laws, but also hearts.
I am frankly overwhelmed and humbled by the courage of people like John Lewis and Nelson Mandela. I have serious doubts about my ability to live up to their example, but I also know what happens when whole groups of people are assumed to be evil villains that are beyond redemption. Human history is replete with examples of the death and destruction that flows from that well. That’s why I’ll continue to admire people like John Lewis and do my best to learn from his life.

0,2020-07-21T23:13:16+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-dystopian-fantasy-of-robotic-warfare-may-soon-become-a-reality/,The dystopian fantasy of robotic warfare may soon become a reality,"On March 26th, the coronavirus accomplished what no foreign adversary has been able to do since the end of World War II: it forced an American aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, to suspend patrol operations and shelter in port. By the time that ship reached dock in Guam, hundreds of sailors had been infected with the disease and nearly the entire crew had to be evacuated. As news of the crisis aboard the TR (as the vessel is known) became public, word came out that at least 40 other U.S. warships, including the carrier USS Ronald Reagan and the guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd, were suffering from Covid-19 outbreaks. None of these approached the scale of the TR and, by June, the Navy was again able to deploy most of those ships on delayed schedules and/or with reduced crews. By then, however, it had become abundantly clear that the long-established U.S. strategy of relying on large, heavily armed warships to project power and defeat foreign adversaries was no longer fully sustainable in a pandemic-stricken world.
Just as the Navy was learning that its preference for big ships with large crews — typically packed into small spaces for extended periods of time –was quite literally proving a dead-end strategy (one of the infected sailors on the TR died of complications from Covid-19), the Army and Marine Corps were making a comparable discovery. Their favored strategy of partnering with local forces in far-flung parts of the world like Iraq, Japan, Kuwait, and South Korea, where local safeguards against infectious disease couldn’t always be relied on (or, as in Okinawa recently, Washington’s allies couldn’t count on the virus-free status of American forces), was similarly flawed. With U.S. and allied troops increasingly forced to remain in isolation from each other, it is proving difficult to conduct the usual joint training-and-combat exercises and operations.
In the short term, American defense officials have responded to such setbacks with various stopgap measures, including sending nuclear-capable B-1, B-2, and B-52 bombers on long-range “show-of-force” missions over contested areas like the Baltic Sea (think: Russia) or the South China Sea (think: China, of course). “We have the capability and capacity to provide long-range fires anywhere, anytime, and can bring overwhelming firepower — even during the pandemic,” insisted General Timothy Ray, commander of the Air Force Global Strike Command, after several such operations.
In another sign of tactical desperation, however, the Navy ordered the shattered crew of the TR out of lockdown in May so that the ship could participate in long-scheduled, China-threatening multi-carrier exercises in the western Pacific. A third of its crew, however, had to be left in hospitals or in quarantine on Guam. “We’re executing according to plan to return to sea and fighting through the virus is part of that,” said the ship’s new captain, Carlos Sardiello, as the TR prepared to depart that Pacific island. (He had been named captain on April 3rd after a letter the carrier’s previous skipper, Brett Crozier, wrote to superiors complaining of deteriorating shipboard health conditions was leaked to the media and the senior Navy leadership fired him.)
Such stopgap measures, and others like them now being undertaken by the Department of Defense, continue to provide the military with a sense of ongoing readiness, even aggressiveness, in a time of Covid-related restrictions. Were the current pandemic to fade away in the not-too-distant future and life return to what once passed for normal, they might prove adequate. Scientists are warning, however, that the coronavirus is likely to persist for a long time and that a vaccine — even if successfully developed — may not prove effective forever. Moreover, many virologists believe that further pandemics, potentially even more lethal than Covid-19, could be lurking on the horizon, meaning that there might never be areturn to a pre-pandemic “normal.”
That being the case, Pentagon officials have been forced to acknowledge that the military foundations of Washington’s global strategy — particularly, the forward deployment of combat forces in close cooperation with allied forces — may have become invalid. In recognition of this harsh new reality, U.S. strategists are beginning to devise an entirely new blueprint for future war, American-style: one that would end, or at least greatly reduce, a dependence on hundreds of overseas garrisons and large manned warships, relying instead on killer robots, a myriad of unmanned vessels, and offshore bases.
Ships Without Sailors
In fact, the Navy’s plans to replace large manned vessels with small, unmanned ones was only accelerated by the outbreak of the pandemic. Several factors had already contributed to the trend: modern warships like nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and missile-armed cruisers had been growing ever more expensive to build. The latest, the USS Gerald R. Ford, has cost a whopping $13.2 billion and still doesn’t work to specifications. So even a profligately funded Pentagon can only afford to be constructing a few at a time. They are also proving increasingly vulnerable to the sorts of anti-ship missiles and torpedoes being developed by powers like China, while, as events on the TR suggest, they’re natural breeding grounds for infectious diseases.
Until the disaster aboard the Theodore Roosevelt, most worrisome were those Chinese land-based, anti-ship weapons capable of striking American carriers and cruisers in distant parts of the Pacific Ocean. This development had already forced naval planners to consider the possibility of keeping their most prized assets far from China’s shores in any potential shooting war, lest they be instantly lost to enemy fire. Rather than accept such a version of defeat before a battle even began, Navy officials had begun adopting a new strategy, sometimes called “distributed maritime operations,” in which smaller manned warships would, in the future, be accompanied into battle by large numbers of tiny, unmanned, missile-armed vessels, or maritime “killer robots.”
In a reflection of the Navy’s new thinking, the service’s surface warfare director, Rear Admiral Ronald Boxall, explained in 2019 that the future fleet, as designed, was to include “104 large surface combatants [and] 52 small surface combatants,” adding, “That’s a little upside down. Should I push out here and have more small platforms? I think the future fleet architecture study has intimated ‘yes,’ and our war gaming shows there is value in that… And when I look at the force, I think: Where can we use unmanned so that I can push it to a smaller platform?”
Think of this as an early public sign of the rise of naval robotic warfare, which is finally leaving dystopian futuristic fantasies for actual future battlefields. In the Navy’s version of this altered landscape, large numbers of unmanned vessels (both surface ships and submarines) will roam the world’s oceans, reporting periodically via electronic means to human operators ashore or on designated command ships. They may, however, operate for long periods on their own or in robotic “wolf packs.”
Such a vision has now been embraced by the senior Pentagon leadership, which sees the rapid procurement and deployment of such robotic vessels as the surest way of achieving the Navy’s (and President Trump’s) goal of a fleet of 355 ships at a time of potentially static defense budgets, recurring pandemics, and mounting foreign threats. “I think one of the ways you get [to the 355-ship level] quickly is moving toward lightly manned [vessels], which over time can be unmanned,” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper typically said in February. “We can go with lightly manned ships… You can build them so they’re optionally manned and then, depending on the scenario or the technology, at some point in time they can go unmanned… That would allow us to get our numbers up quickly, and I believe that we can get to 355, if not higher, by 2030.”
To begin to implement such an audacious plan, that very month the Pentagon requested $938 million for the next two fiscal years to procure three prototype large unmanned surface vessels (LUSVs) and another $56 million for the initial development of a medium-sized unmanned surface vessel (MUSV). If such efforts prove successful, the Navy wants another $2.1 billion from 2023 through 2025 to procure seven deployable LUSVs and one prototype MUSV.
Naval officials have, however, revealed little about the design or ultimate functioning of such robot warships. All that service’s 2021 budget request says is that “the unmanned surface vessel (USV) is a reconfigurable, multi-mission vessel designed to provide low cost, high endurance, reconfigurable ships able to accommodate various payloads for unmanned missions and augment the Navy’s manned surface force.”
Based on isolated reports in the military trade press, the most that can be known about such future (and futuristic) ships, is that they will resemble miniature destroyers, perhaps 200 feet long, with no crew quarters but a large array of guided missiles and anti-submarine weapons. Such vessels will also be equipped with sophisticated computer systems enabling them to operate autonomously for long periods of time and — under circumstances yet to be clarified — take offensive action on their own or in coordination with other unmanned vessels.
The future deployment of robot warshipson the high seas raises troubling questions. To what degree, for instance, will they be able to choose targets on their own for attack and annihilation? The Navy has yet to provide an adequate answer to this question, provoking disquiet among arms control and human rights advocates who fear that such ships could “go rogue” and start or escalate a conflict on their own. And that’s obviously a potential problem in a world of recurring pandemics where killer robots could prove the only types of ships the Navy dares deploy in large numbers.
Fighting from Afar
When it comes to the prospect of recurring pandemics, the ground combat forces of the Army and Marine Corps face a comparable dilemma.
Ever since the end of World War II, American military strategy has called for U.S. forces to “fight forward” — that is, on or near enemy territory rather than anywhere near the United States. This, in turn, has meant maintaining military alliances with numerous countries around the world so that American forces can be based on their soil, resulting in hundreds of U.S. military bases globally. In wartime, moreover, U.S. strategy assumes that many of these countries will provide troops for joint operations against a common enemy. To fight the Soviets in Europe, the U.S. created NATO and acquired garrisons throughout Western Europe; to fight communism in Asia, it established military ties with Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, the Philippines, and other local powers, acquiring scores of bases there as well. When Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Islamic terrorism became major targets of its military operations, the Pentagon forged ties with and acquired bases in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.
In a pandemic-free world, such a strategy offers numerous advantages for an imperial power. In time of war, for example, there’s no need to transport American troops (with all their heavy equipment) into the combat zone from bases thousands of miles away. However, in a world of recurring pandemics, such a vision is fast becoming a potentially unsustainable nightmare.
To begin with, it’s almost impossible to isolate thousands of U.S. soldiers and their families (who often accompany them on long-term deployments) from surrounding populations (or those populations from them). As a result, any viral outbreak outside base gates is likely to find its way inside and any outbreak on the base is likely to head in the opposite direction. This, in fact, occurred at numerous overseas facilities this spring. Camp Humphreys in South Korea, for example, was locked down after four military dependents, four American contractors, and four South Korean employees became infected with Covid-19. It was the same on several bases in Japan and on the island of Okinawa when Japanese employees tested positive for the virus (and, more recently, when U.S. military personnel at five bases there were found to have Covid-19). Add in Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti and Ahmed al-Jaber Air Base in Kuwait, not to speak of the fact that, in Europe, some 2,600 American soldiers have been placed in quarantine after suspected exposure to Covid-19. (And if the U.S. military is anxious about all this in other countries, think about how America’s allies feel at a moment when Donald Trump’s America has become the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic.)
A world of recurring pandemics will make it nearly impossible for U.S. forces to work side-by-side with their foreign counterparts, especially in poorer nations that lack adequate health and sanitation facilities. This is already true in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the coronavirus is thought to have spread widely among friendly local forces and American soldiers have been ordered to suspend joint training missions with them.
A return to the pre-Covid world appears increasingly unlikely, so the search is now on big time for a new guiding strategy for Army and Marine combat operations in the years to come. As with the Navy, this search actually began before the outbreak of the coronavirus, but has gained fresh urgency in its wake.
To insulate ground operations from the dangers of a pandemic-stricken planet, the two services are exploring a similar operating model: instead of deploying large, heavily-armed troop contingents close to enemy borders, they hope to station small, highly mobile forces on U.S.-controlled islands or at other reasonably remote locations, where they can fire long-range ballistic missiles at vital enemy assets with relative impunity. To further reduce the risk of illness or casualties, such forces will, over time, be augmented on the front lines by ever more “unmanned” creations, including armed machines — again those “killer robots” — designed to perform the duties of ordinary soldiers.
The Marine Corps’ version of this future combat model was first spelled out in Force Design 2030, a document released by Corps commandant General David Berger in the pandemic month of March 2020. Asserting that the Marines’ existing structure was unsuited to the world of tomorrow, he called for a radical restructuring of the force to eliminate heavy, human-operated weapons like tanks and instead increase mobility and long-range firepower with a variety of missiles and what he assumes will be a proliferation of unmanned systems. “Operating under the assumption that we will not receive additional resources,” he wrote, “we must divest certain existing capabilities and capacities to free resources for essential new capabilities.” Among those “new capabilities” that he considers crucial: additional unmanned aerial systems, or drones, that “can operate from ship, from shore, and [be] able to employ both [intelligence-]collection and lethal payloads.”
In its own long-range planning, the Army is placing an even greater reliance on creating a force of robots, or at least “optionally manned” systems. Anticipating a future of heavily-armed adversaries engaging U.S. forces in high-intensity warfare, it’s seeking to reduce troop exposure to enemy fire by designing all future combat-assault systems, including tanks, troop-carriers, and helicopters, to be either human-occupied or robotically self-directed as circumstances dictate. The Army’s next-generation infantry assault weapon, for instance, has been dubbed an optionally manned fighting vehicle (OMFV). As its name suggests, it is intended to operate with or without onboard human operators. The Army is also procuring a robotic utility vehicle, the squad multipurpose equipment transport (SMET), intended to carry 1,000 pounds of supplies and ammunition. Looking further into the future, that service has also begun development of a robotic combat vehicle (RCV), or a self-driving tank.
The Army is also speeding the development of long-range artillery and missile systems that will make attacks on enemy positions from well behind the front lines ever more central to any future battle with a major enemy. These include the extended range cannon artillery, an upgraded Paladin-armored howitzer with an extra-long barrel and supercharged propellant that should be able to hit targets 40 miles away, and the even more advanced precision strike missile (PrSM), a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a range of at least 310 miles.
Many analysts, in fact, believe that the PrSM will be able to strike at far greater distances than that, putting critical enemy targets — air bases, radar sites, command centers — at risk from launch sites far to the rear of American forces. In case of war with China, this could mean firing missiles from friendly partner-nations like Japan or U.S.-controlled Pacific islands like Guam. Indeed, this possibility has alarmed Air Force supporters who fear that the Army is usurping the sorts of long-range strike missions traditionally assigned to combat aircraft.
A Genuine Strategic Redesign
All these plans and programs are being promoted to enable the U.S. military to continue performing its traditional missions of power projection and warfighting in a radically altered world. Seen from that perspective, measures like removing sailors from crowded warships, downsizing U.S. garrisons in distant lands, and replacing human combatants with robotic ones might seem sensible. But looked at from what might be called the vantage point of comprehensive security — or the advancement of all aspects of American safety and wellbeing — they appear staggeringly myopic.
If the scientists are right and the coronavirus will linger for a long period and, in the decades to come, be followed by other pandemics of equal or greater magnitude, the true future threats to American security could be microbiological (and economic), not military. After all, the current pandemic has already killed more Americans than died in the Korean and Vietnam wars combined, while triggering the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Imagine, then, what a more lethal pandemic might do. The country’s armed forces may still have an important role to play in such an environment — providing, for example, emergency medical assistance and protecting vital infrastructure — but fighting never-ending wars in distant lands and projecting power globally should not rank high when it comes to where taxpayer dollars go for “security” in such challenging times.
One thing is inescapable: as the disaster aboard the Theodore Roosevelt indicates, the U.S. military must reconsider how it arms and structures its forces and give serious thought to alternative models of organization. But focusing enormous resources on the replacement of pre-Covid ships and tanks with post-Covid killer robots for endless rounds of foreign wars is hardly in America’s ultimate security interest. There is, sadly, something highly robotic about such military thinking when it comes to this changing world of ours.

The longtime girlfriend of the late Jeffrey Epstein, who was believed to have engaged in decades of sex trafficking and abuse of young girls, is now in federal custody. She faces multiple charges of participating in sex trafficking with Epstein, who was also a friend of the president before they reportedly had a falling out.
A reporter asked Trump if he had any comment on the prospect that Maxwell might turn in powerful men as a part of her case.
“I haven’t really been following it too much,” Trump said. “I just wish her well, frankly. I met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is.”
Watch the clip below:

Many observers noted that Trump’s friendly remarks were stunning in light of Maxwell’s alleged crimes. In other contexts, the president has been much harsher toward people his administration accuses of sex trafficking:
An estimated 25 million people around the world today are being held captive, manipulated, and abused by human traffickers.
In 2018 alone, the National Human Trafficking Hotline identified over 23,000 human trafficking victims in the United States.  Sixty-five percent of these victims were women.  More than one in five were children.  Human traffickers prey on their most vulnerable citizens and people.   They’re vicious.  They’re violent.
My administration is fighting these monsters, persecuting and prosecuting them, and locking them away for a very, very long time.  We’ve had a tremendous track record — the best track record in a long time.
Trump’s dubious ties to Epstein go beyond his personal friendship with the man. The president appointed Alex Acosta to be his Labor Secretary, despite his involvement in giving a now widely derided sweetheart deal to Epstein as a federal prosecutor when his crimes were first being discovered. Acosta eventually resigned under pressure from the scandal when Epstein was re-arrested in 2019.

0,2020-07-21T21:13:45+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/mitch-mcconnell-exposes-his-disdain-for-workers-as-the-economy-faces-a-tsunami-of-destruction/,Mitch McConnell exposes his disdain for workers as the economy faces a tsunami of destruction,"Ken Merkel started cutting expenses as soon as Packaging Corp. of America (PCA) furloughed him along with hundreds of other workers at its Jackson, Alabama, location amid the COVID-19 recession.
Although the Army veteran and community volunteer slashed his car insurance, quit his satellite TV service and canceled a life insurance policy, he still needs $600 in weekly federal unemployment payments to make ends meet.
But this lifeline for Merkel and more than 30 million other unemployed workers is in jeopardy because Senate Republicans refuse to extend the benefits period and pass other legislation critically needed to battle the pandemic.
Instead of safeguarding hard-working Americans who fell on hard times through no fault of their own, callous Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—the person who controls the Senate’s agenda—put them squarely in harm’s way.
The 54-year-old Merkel, for example, got his first job pumping gas when he was 12 and never stopped pushing himself. Now, as infection rates soar across the U.S. and COVID-19 threatens still more damage to the nation’s economy, the former military policeman could lose almost everything he spent a lifetime building.
The Democratic-controlled House already passed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act to combat the pandemic and help millions of average Americans avert financial calamity.
The commonsense legislation would extend emergency federal unemployment benefits, due to expire at the end of July, through January. It would provide aid to local governments struggling to maintain essential public services because of COVID-19 budget crises, deliver another round of stimulus checks to hard-pressed families and ensure that those who lose their jobs continue to receive health insurance.
The HEROES Act would finally force the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to take steps to protect workers from COVID-19 on the job. And it would allocate billions of dollars for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, measures crucial for controlling the virus in hotspots like Alabama and McConnell’s home state of Kentucky.
But more than two months after the House passed the HEROES Act, it languishes in the Senate.
In refusing to bring the measure to a vote, McConnell flaunts both his disdain for average Americans and his indifference to the enormous damage that COVID-19 continues to inflict on the country each day.
He derided the HEROES Act as a “wish list” of giveaways—a windfall for people he considers freeloaders—when it’s really a responsible stopgap measure intended to save lives and sustain unemployed workers until they get back to the jobs they’re proud to do.
McConnell even claimed that continuing the $600 federal unemployment payments, provided on top of benefits supplied by the states, would just give workers a reason to stay home instead of returning to their jobs.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Laid-off Americans aren’t the lazy moochers McConnell evidently thinks they are. They’re loyal, patriotic workers who faithfully did their part to keep the nation functioning right up until the moment their employers furloughed them.
Walking a mile in Merkel’s shoes—or those of his co-workers—would show this out-of-touch millionaire just how much average Americans struggle right now.
Without the $600 in weekly federal benefits, for example, the PCA workers in Jackson will have to try to scrape by on a scant $275 provided by the state of Alabama. That’s all but impossible.
“I’ve already cut the best I can,” explained Merkel, a winder operator and member of United Steelworkers (USW) Local 9-1083 who not only has his own bills to pay but helps his stepmother with hers. “Ask the congressmen and the senators how much they could go without.”
As if he isn’t already struggling enough, losing federal unemployment benefits will force Merkel to start dipping into his retirement savings. And at that point, he noted, “I’ll be hurting my future.”
Local 9-1083 President Valerie Creagh receives calls and texts every day from colleagues concerned about the $600 payments.
Without that assistance, some risk losing the cars and homes they worked hard to afford. Others would fare much worse.
“It would actually force some of our members into poverty,” predicted Creagh. “I hate to say that, but it’s just the truth.”
Merkel would be happy to let the federal government keep the unemployment money. What he really wants is to go back to work.
“I earned my place,” he said, noting the skills and training his trade requires. “My desire is to continue to gain, to work and to get more out of life.”
Workers around the country face the same plight as their PCA counterparts.
Another 1.3 million filed unemployment claims in the week ending July 11, joining the tens of millions who already lost their jobs because of COVID-19.
Layoffs began in the service sector; cascaded across the steel, rubber, aluminum, paper and auto industries; and now threaten thousands of airline workers.
Also, as Americans lost their jobs and businesses closed or scaled back, local governments lost billions in tax revenue that they rely on to pay public workers, provide essential services and even fight the pandemic.
Many cities, counties and transit agencies already cut personnel, services and programs because of huge budget shortfalls. And more will do the same in coming months if McConnell and other Senate Republicans fail to deliver the billions in local government aid allocated through the HEROES Act.
Despite this tsunami of destruction, McConnell feels no urgency to take up the legislation.
Workers don’t concern him. Corporations do.
As the COVID-19 death toll mounts, McConnell refuses to advocate for ordinary Americans. Instead, his goal is protecting companies that failed to take adequate steps to safeguard workers and customers sickened or killed by COVID-19.
He insists that Congress pass legislation giving corporations sweeping immunity from what—in his mind—will be a mountain of frivolous lawsuits filed by moochers. If he ever addresses the HEROES Act, McConnell likely will insist that corporate immunity become part of the deal.
The HEROES Act isn’t perfect.
It contains a provision called the GROW Act, for example, that would make it easier for employers to stop their contributions to multiemployer pension plans, putting workers’ retirement security at risk. This unacceptable provision must be stricken from the final version of the legislation.
But the HEROES Act provides crucial aid to Americans fighting to pay their bills. It ensures that local governments will continue providing police, fire and other essential services.
And it gives health officials the resources they need to conduct COVID-19 testing, track community spread and fight the infection rate while researchers work furiously on a vaccine.
“Maybe there’s light at the end of the tunnel,” Merkel said. “But meanwhile, we have to get through the tunnel.”
Tom Conway is the international president of the United Steelworkers Union (USW).

It all started with Trump’s speech at Mt. Rushmore on July 4th.
Seventeen seventy-six represented the culmination of thousands of years of western civilization and the triumph not only of spirit, but of wisdom, philosophy, and reason.
And yet, as we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled, they bled to secure.
Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children…
This attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty, must be stopped, and it will be stopped very quickly.  We will expose this dangerous movement, protect our nation’s children, end this radical assault, and preserve our beloved American way of life…
Make no mistake: this left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution.
That was followed up by a speech from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the National Constitution Center to unveil the first report from his “Commission on Unalienable Rights.” The secretary had established the commission a year ago in order to ground our foreign policy in this country’s founding ideals. The first thing to note is that Pompeo thinks that it is necessary to prioritize which unalienable rights are most important.
…the report emphasizes foremost among these rights are property rights and religious liberty. No one can enjoy the pursuit of happiness if you cannot own the fruits of your own labor, and no society – no society can retain its legitimacy or a virtuous character without religious freedom.
Of course, what a Christian nationalist like Pompeo means when he talks about “religious liberty” is the freedom of white evangelical Christians to do what they please and all other religions be damned. That one has a lot of human rights advocates pointing out that it is the rights of women and LGBTQ persons to be treated as equal citizens under the law that are getting thrown under the bus.
Pompeo mentioned Trump’s speech at Mt. Rushmore when he launched into his own attack on those who are protesting against police brutality.
President Trump spoke about this at Mount Rushmore on the Fourth of July. And our rights tradition is under assault.
The New York Times’s 1619 Project – so named for the year that the first slaves were transported to America – wants you to believe that our country was founded for human bondage.
They want you to believe that America’s institutions continue to reflect the country’s acceptance of slavery at our founding.
They want you to believe that Marxist ideology that America is only the oppressors and the oppressed. The Chinese Communist Party must be gleeful when they see the New York Times spout this ideology.
Some people have taken these false doctrines to heart. The rioters pulling down statues thus see nothing wrong with desecrating monuments to those who fought for our unalienable rights – from our founding to the present day.
This is a dark vision of America’s birth. I reject it. It’s a disturbed reading of history. It is a slander on our great people. Nothing could be further from the truth of our founding and the rights about which this report speaks.
The commission reminds us – it’s got a quote from Frederick Douglas, himself a freed slave, who saw the Constitution as a “glorious, liberty document.” That it is.
That quote from Frederick Douglass is a favorite among conservatives. What they don’t tell you is that it comes from his speech titled, “What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?’ given in 1852—nine years before the Civil War. Speaking to a white audience, Douglass refers to “your National Independence, and of your political freedom” (emphasis mine), making it clear that it doesn’t apply to those who were enslaved. You can almost see the tongue-in-cheek way that he talks about what led up to the Declaration of Independence from British rule.
Feeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. They petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. Their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. This, however, did not answer the purpose. They saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. Yet they persevered. They were not the men to look back…
Oppression makes a wise man mad. Your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. They felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. With brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. Just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! It was a startling idea, much more so, than we, at this distance of time, regard it. The timid and the prudent (as has been intimated) of that day, were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.
It seems pretty clear that Pompeo has never read Douglass’s whole speech. So it might surprise him to learn that the man he quoted referred to our founding fathers as oppressed, but wise men who chaffed under their treatment by the home government. The Declaration of Independence was actually a protest document.
But by the end of his speech, Douglass made it clear that these founding ideals were not extended to people like him.
I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. — The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.
That is the part of Douglass’s speech that Pompeo doesn’t want you to hear—much less read himself. There are people who are still mourning the fact that American hasn’t lived up to its ideals. They are taking to the streets to protest and this administration is doing everything in their power to vilify, threaten, and stop them.
It is worth noting that it was this country’s first African American president who drew our attention to the words contained in the preamble to the Constitution during his 2008 speech about race in America (emphasis mine).
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
Here’s what Obama said.
Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution — a Constitution that had at its very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty and justice and a union that could be and should be perfected over time.
And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part — through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk — to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time.
With the passing of John Lewis over the weekend, this is also a time to remember the words Obama spoke to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the march he led across the bridge in Selma, Alabama.
As we commemorate their achievement, we are well-served to remember that at the time of the marches, many in power condemned rather than praised them.  Back then, they were called Communists, or half-breeds, or outside agitators, sexual and moral degenerates, and worse –- they were called everything but the name their parents gave them.  Their faith was questioned.  Their lives were threatened.  Their patriotism challenged.
And yet, what could be more American than what happened in this place? What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people –- unsung, the downtrodden, the dreamers not of high station, not born to wealth or privilege, not of one religious tradition but many, coming together to shape their country’s course?
What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this, what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?
That’s why Selma is not some outlier in the American experience.  That’s why it’s not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance.  It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents:  “We the People… in order to form a more perfect union.”  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”
It is people like Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo who are in the process of threatening the ideals on which this country was founded. They are the ones who are calling protesters “everything but the name their parents gave them” and serving up the modern-day equivalent of the billy clubs used against people like John Lewis on “Bloody Sunday.”
The great divide in this country has always been the one between those in power who will do anything to maintain the status quo and those who revere our founding ideals enough to join the struggle to perfect our union. It’s once again time to choose a side.

More than 280 people, according to WSJ reporter Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg, signed the letter and told Latour, “Opinion’s lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence, undermine our readers’ trust and our ability to gain credibility with sources.”
In the letter, the journalists complain that the Journal recently published an op-ed on coronavirus infections by Vice President Mike Pence “without checking government figures.” The piece had to be corrected after publication for a factual error.
According to Trachtenberg, “The letter says many readers don’t understand that there is a wall between the Journal’s editorial page operations — which have been overseen by Paul Gigot since 2001 — and the news staff, which is overseen by Editor in Chief Matt Murray. Mr. Murray was also copied on the letter.”
The letter had some recommendations for the Journal’s digital operations — for example, it proposed that on the publication’s website and mobile apps, opinion pieces would be clearly labeled as such and would be accompanied by a disclaimer saying, “The Wall Street Journal’s Opinion pages are independent of its newsroom.” And the letter also proposed removing opinion pieces from the “Most Popular Articles” and “Recommended Videos” lists on the Journal’s website and creating a separate “Most Popular in Opinion” list.
“WSJ journalists should not be reprimanded for writing about errors published in Opinion, whether we make those observations in our articles, on social media, or elsewhere,” the letter recommended.

0,2020-07-21T20:02:59+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/an-ex-gop-insider-details-how-trumps-3-point-re-election-plan-crumbled-before-his-eyes/,An ex-GOP insider details how Trump’s 3-point re-election plan crumbled before his eyes,"The fact that President Donald Trump has been trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in poll after poll — sometimes by double digits — doesn’t necessarily mean that he won’t be reelected. Trump still has three and one-half months to turn things around, and his Republican allies won’t hesitate to resort to sleazy tricks like voter suppression. But at the moment, things aren’t looking good for Trump’s reelection campaign — which, Never Trump conservative Tim Miller emphasizes in a July 20 article for The Bulwark, has been desperately searching for a new strategy.
Trump, Miller notes, “had a plan to defeat Sleepy Joe Biden” earlier this year: attack the former VP’s “mental acuity,” defame him over Ukraine, and brag about the state of the U.S. economy. But that was before the coronavirus crisis went from bad to worse and Trump’s 2020 campaign, as Miller puts it, “got punched in the mouth.”
“The COVID-19 pandemic crumpled the economy that Trump was taking credit for,” explains Miller, who served as communications director for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. “Suddenly, Trump’s plans were moot. No longer did he have merely to run a smear campaign against an opponent who has lost a step, feed red meat to his rabid crowds, and take credit for good things that other people were doing — three tactics that make up his core skill set…. He would have to manage a real-life crisis that was directly affecting people’s lives, rather than just a PR crisis. And he was going to be judged on his performance.”
The anti-Biden line of attack that Trump had in mind earlier this year, according to Miller, was “cut from under him.”
Miller notes, “With unemployment at 11% and over 140,000 Americans dead from the virus, Keep America Great no longer rings true…. Sleepy Joe is starting to sound like a compliment, and President Trump’s own performance is not bolstering the contrast with Biden on the issue of mental acuity.”
For Trump’s troubled 2020 campaign, Miller adds, “a new approach is necessary” — and the “three-point plan” that Trump has been trying to use against Biden isn’t working. Coronavirus, according to Miller, is a crisis that Trump’s campaign is showing no signs of recovering from, and voters aren’t buying Trump’s efforts to paint Biden as “Antifa Joe.”
“The president has been punched,” Miller argues. “And the new three-point plan is as follows: (1) Ignore the thing that is punching you in the mouth over and over again, causing death and economic destruction throughout the country. (2) Pray that someone else fixes the problem for you. (3) Depict yourself as the law-and-order president by sending federal cops in camo to clash with protesters and convince the world that Average Joe Biden is the leader of MS-13.”
Miller adds, “In short, Trump has got just over 100 days left to get bailed out by the vaccine gods or come up with a new plan. Otherwise, it’s gonna be a TKO.”

0,2020-07-21T19:44:23+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/legal-experts-slam-trumps-blatantly-unconstitutional-attempt-to-corrupt-the-census/,Legal experts slam Trump’s ‘blatantly unconstitutional’ attempt to corrupt the census,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a memorandum declaring undocumented immigrants are not to be counted when the number of U.S. Representatives for each state is allotted. That process, called “apportionment,” occurs every ten years after the official national census is conducted.
The U.S. Constitution mandates the census, which is being conducted this year, count “the whole number of persons in each state.” It makes no distinction as to their citizenship status.
What Trump is doing is claiming he has the authority to bypass the Constitution and declare undocumented immigrants are not “persons,” and therefore, literally, do not count.
The intention and effect, clearly, would be to create more Republican-leaning congressional seats and reduce the number of Democratic-leaning congressional seats.
The move follows a hard-fought campaign by the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the census. The Supreme Court blocked Trump in that fight and it was not included.
Legal experts are calling Trump’s move today “outrageous,” “illegal,” and say it unconstitutional.
U.S. Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) accused Trump of “once again trying to weaponize the Census to scare immigrant communities for his own political purposes. This is patently unconstitutional and should be immediately challenged in court.”
Calling it “flagrantly unconstitutional to exclude people from the Census count based on their immigration status,” U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said the “Constitution requires that every person be counted. This is another attempt by Trump to use scaremongering against immigrants & rig the system.”
Slate’s legal expert, journalist Mark Joseph Stern calls the decree “Stupid, impracticable, and illegal.” He adds:
The Constitution says: “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of PERSONS in each state.”
Trump says undocumented immigrants aren’t “persons” under the Constitution. That’s Dred Scott stuff.

NPR’s national correspondent reporting on the 2020 Census, Hansi Lo Wang, says Trump has “has no final authority” over the census:

And on Tuesday, after a terse back-and-forth with Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, some right-wing critics accused the reporter of calling McEnany a “lying bitch” during a press briefing.
But video and the White House transcript of the conservation shows that Halkett never said that.
Halkett, originally from British Columbia in Western Canada, has been covering the White House for Al Jazeera’s English-language division since the late 1990s. At the press briefing, Halkett had a tense discussion with McEnany when the two briefly addressed voting by mail. McEnany told Halkett: “There are questions about mass mail-out voting, and I know you don’t want to hear them — which is why you talk over me.”
Far-right activists who have accused Halkett of calling McEnany a “lying bitch” include Chuck Callesto, American Majority founder Ned Ryun and Brigitte Gabriel (founder of the anti-Muslim group ACT! for America). Gabriel posted, “Hey @KimberlyHalkett, We all heard you call the @PressSec a ‘lying bitch’ on a hot mic. What do you have to say for yourself?”
Hey @KimberlyHalkett,
We all heard you call the @PressSec a “lying bitch” on a hot mic.

— Brigitte Gabriel (@ACTBrigitte) July 21, 2020
But CNN’s Daniel Dale has fact-checked Halkett’s critics, tweeting that McEnany was never called a “lying bitch.” And a White House press transcript of the exchange shows what was actually said. When McEnany decided that she didn’t want to talk to Halkett anymore, she told her, “You’ve gotten two questions, which is more than some of your colleagues” — to which Halkett responded, “OK, you don’t want to engage.” Halkett, according to the transcript, accused McEnany of not wanting to answer her questions, but the words “lying bitch” were never used.
The transcript bears out Dale’s description of what was actually said. Dale tweeted, “Nobody called McEnany a ‘lying bitch.’ When McEnany declined to continue responding to follow-ups, the reporter muttered, ‘OK, you don’t want to engage.’ You don’t even need to slow down the audio.”
You can also listen to the video below to hear the exchange:

But according to medical expert Michael Osterholm, CNN reports, a lot more pain is forthcoming.
Christina Maxouris and Jay Croft report that Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, warns that the pandemic is only in its early stages. And a lot more social distancing, Osterholm stresses, will be needed in the months to come.
“It’s all about distancing, and that’s what actually drove down the numbers last spring,” Osterholm told CNN. “We really did create a lot of distancing, and until we do that, we’re going to have an impossible time driving this virus down to a level which then, we can test and trace on a routine basis like other countries and open up our economy again safely.”
But even though Osterholm warns that the pandemic has only reached its early stages, Maxouris and Croft report that recent weeks have given Americans a lot to worry about.
“People are testing positive for coronavirus in record-breaking numbers across the U.S., and the surge in cases is slowing down the time tests take,” the CNN journalists report. “Labs across the country are now facing what seems like an almost infinite demand.”
On top of that, coronavirus-related deaths have been on the rise in Sun Belt states such as Florida and Texas. And Dr. Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston told CNN, “South Texas is just getting hit incredibly hard. The hospitals are overwhelmed.”

0,2020-07-21T18:41:39+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/trump-has-awakened-a-sleeping-giant-and-hell-live-to-regret-it/,Trump has awakened a sleeping giant — and he’ll live to regret it,"According to Harry Enten, Joe Biden is currently leading the presidential race by historic margins in the suburbs.
Biden is up by a 52% to 43% margin among suburban voters in the ABC News/Washington Post poll…In the average of all the polls, Biden’s ahead by more than 15 points with suburban voters. This is a historic margin, if it holds…Four years ago at this time, Trump was beating Clinton by a 45% to 35% margin in the ABC/Washington Post poll among suburban voters…
If you were to go back over time, the exit poll data reveals that no Democrat has won the suburban vote by more than 5 points since at least 1972, when the first exit poll was taken in a presidential election…Back in 2008 (the best year for Democrats this century), Obama won in the suburbs by 2 points in the exit polls. The final ABC News/Washington Post poll had him winning in the suburbs by 5 points.
There are a couple of things to keep in mind about this data. The first is that the demographics of the suburbs are changing, as I documented a few months ago. No longer the exclusive destination of “white flight” that began in the 1960s, the suburban population is becoming more diverse both in terms of race and class.
Secondly, the so-called “blue wave” of the 2018 midterms happened primarily in the suburbs. Of the 41 congressional districts that Democrats turned from red to blue that year, 38 were suburban. That was paired with the biggest gender gap in U.S. political history.
The term “resistance” has been used to describe everything from Black Lives Matter to the Bernie Sanders campaign. But we must never forget the role that women (especially mothers) played. It all started with the Women’s March the same weekend that Trump was inaugurated. As the research by Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson documented, it didn’t end there.
…after they marched, many of them went home, held meetings, invited friends to the meetings, started Facebook groups to get more friends to the meetings, called their Congressional representatives, held letter-writing parties, flooded Town Halls, and, finally, figured out which Republicans in their town councils or county governments or state legislatures or congressional districts they wanted to get rid of—and sometimes, which Democrats…
As parents and often churchgoers, they have broad networks of family and friends. Maybe they recently retired and have time on their hands. Their groups shrank a bit over the summer, but Trump’s belligerent tweets and reckless executive orders have served as a kind of reveille, rallying at least some of the troops back to the flag.
As I wrote just prior to the 2018 midterms, even white evangelical mothers in Texas rebelled against Trump’s caging of immigrant children, leading one of them to say that “I care as much about babies at the border as I do about babies in the womb.”
It was the “Mothers of the Movement” that organized against police brutality after the killing of their unarmed children by law enforcement. One of them, Lucy McBath, was elected to Congress in 2018 to represent a district in suburban Georgia.
That’s why it didn’t surprise me that mothers showed up this weekend in Portland, Oregon—armed with face masks and bike helmets— to protest the actions of federal troops in that city.
Incredible scene in Portland right now. A group of Moms are chanting, “Feds stay clear! Moms are here!” at the federal courthouse.

The list of things Donald Trump has done to offend mothers in this country is long—not the least of which is his attempt to force their children back to school with no plan to keep them safe from a raging pandemic. As Skocpol and Williamson documented with their research, many of these mothers had never been involved in electoral politics before. The president and his Republican enablers have woken up a sleeping giant and the day will come when they rue the day they did so.

0,2020-07-21T18:19:21+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/why-biden-might-be-trumps-kryptonite/,Why Biden might be Trump’s kryptonite,"The following observation from New York Times columnist Ross Douthat is almost completely accurate:
“There is no strategy that this president could adopt, no policy choice that he could make, no tweet of himself in a mask that he could issue, that would fundamentally alter his political position. Trump is incapable of normal presidential action, and even if his aides and handlers concocted such a strategy, the man in charge would make sure it would fail … ”
“But that doesn’t make his defeat inevitable. It only means that to speculate about a Trump comeback is to necessarily speculate about possibilities that are outside the president’s control.”
I’d say it was 100 percent accurate, but there is always hacking and cheating to consider, and Trump would presumably have to sign off on that, wouldn’t he?
Perhaps not, actually, since he’s no more capable of concocting a sophisticated and successful plan to steal an election than he is of running a honest solvent business. If something like that were to work, it would be executed by people Trump doesn’t control.
Assuming there is an honest count, even taking into consideration all the typical voter suppression shenanigans of the Republicans, it’s almost impossible to conceive of Trump winning the popular vote. It’s also nearly as difficult to see him winning the Electoral College. He isn’t going to do anything to help himself, either, so the odds heavily favor a steady worsening of his position rather than any improvement.
But it’s conceivable that Joe Biden could stumble badly or that the mood of the country shifts hard against the Democrats. Douthat suggests that a sudden improvement in the coronavirus crisis combined with an uptick of social protest could provide this kind of mood change, and I think that’s correct. I also think Douthat is right to be skeptical that urban unrest would be as impactful as it was in the late-1960s, since white flight has already occurred in this instance. It’s probably true, too, that a magical disappearance of the virus through a vaccine or lower-than-expected herd immunity would probably have a calming effect, making widespread looting less likely.
Trump’s biggest problem is himself, but the Democrats knew what they were doing when they chose Biden to run against him. As Douthat says, “There still remains the difficulty that not enough Americans are afraid to vote for Joe Biden, notwithstanding the Trump campaign’s attempt to brand him as the candidate of Antifa.”
Choosing a likable candidate to run against Trump was the magic kryptonite missing from the 2016 election. It renders the president virtually powerless, and now he’s just hoping that Biden’s choice of a running mate will give him a batter opportunity to attack. Preventing that possibility must be part of the thinking behind Senator Tammy Duckworth as a potential pick. A multi-racial disabled woman who was wounded in the line of duty in Iraq is not someone who can be effectively mocked and ridiculed. More kryptonite.
Duckworth would fit a do-no-harm strategy, but Biden probably has the luxury of picking anyone he deems qualified and suitable as a partner. What should keep him up at night are the things he can’t control.

Ted Yoho of Florida.
Yoho called the Congresswoman from Queens and The Bronx, a “fucking bitch.”
Ocasio-Cortez, known as “AOC,” was making her way up the steps of Capitol Hill as the Florida Republican and GOP Congressman Ted Williams of Texas were going down.
“Yoho told Ocasio-Cortez she was ‘disgusting’ for recently suggesting that poverty and unemployment are driving a spike in crime in New York City during the coronavirus pandemic,” The Hill reports.
Yoho didn’t stop there.
“You are out of your freaking mind,” he added.
Ocasio-Cortez responded by saying he was being “rude.”
A few steps later, Yoho unleashed his verbal assault.
“Fucking bitch,” he said.
There does not seem to be any dispute about what happened.
Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez responded to the attack via Twitter.
“But hey, ‘b*tches’ get stuff done,” she tweeted.
I never spoke to Rep. Yoho before he decided to accost me on the steps of the nation’s Capitol yesterday.
Believe it or not, I usually get along fine w/ my GOP colleagues. We know how to check our legislative sparring at the committee door.
But hey, “b*tches” get stuff done. https://t.co/WlG3xccwR7
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 21, 2020
She didn’t stop there, insisting Congressman Williams was no silent bystander, and accused him of “lying” about his participation.
What’s wild to me @RogerWilliamsTX is why would you blatantly lie to a reporter who saw this exchange?
You were yelling at me too, about “throwing urine.”
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 21, 2020
In what could be considered an apparent accusation of sexism, AOC retweeted two Democrats, both men, who say they had similar conversations about poverty and crime with Rep. Yoho but did not receive the same vitriol.
She also retweeted this, from Pod Save America co-host Tommy Vietor:
The comments by @RepTedYoho about @AOC didn’t happen in a vacuum. Republicans and right-wing media outlets have spent years lying about, demonizing and dehumanizing her. It’s not a coincidence that Fox News’s favorite targets are women of color like AOC, Rep. Omar, Susan Rice.
— Tommy Vietor (@TVietor08) July 21, 2020
Congressman Yoho has not apologized as of this writing.

0,2020-07-21T17:24:20+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/angry-misogynists-who-commit-murder-arent-lone-wolves-theyre-part-of-an-increasingly-violent-movement/,Angry misogynists who commit murder aren’t lone wolves — they’re part of an increasingly violent movement,"When the son and husband of Esther Salas, a federal judge in New Jersey, were shot at home on Saturday evening by a man dressed as a Fed Ex driver, attention first focused on Salas’ role in a financial case involving Deutsche Bank and Jeffrey Epstein. Soon, however, it turned out that the assailant — who took the life of Daniel Anderl, Salas’s 20-year-old son — had no involvement in that case. Instead, he was Roy Den Hollander, an attorney and notorious “men’s rights” troll who had a long history of filing frivolous lawsuits trying to “prove” that men, not women, are the real victims of sex discrimination. After what appears to have been an attempted assassination of Salas, Den Hollander went home and killed himself.
Den Hollander’s previous cases involved his efforts to sue nightclubs for having “Ladies Nights,” where they charge women lower prices for admission and drinks, and to sue Columbia University simply for having a women’s studies program. He also accused his ex-wife, a Russian-born woman who dumped him once her green card application had been approved, of being part of a global crime syndicate that included her divorce lawyers, a bank in Cyprus, a New York police detective and a topless bar. (That case, unsurprisingly, was dismissed.) As a New Yorker profile in 2007 made clear, Den Hollander was obsessed with the idea that he was entitled to having younger women sexually available — or, in his words, “waiting to give delights, understanding and loyalty.” Since that wasn’t working out, he spiraled into tantrum and sued everyone in sight, desperately seeking prove that men are the real victims of oppression.
For much of Den Hollander’s career as a professional misogynist, liberal observers treated him as a joke. I certainly made fun of him at my former blog for his Ladies Night suits, as the guy who wanted to believe that “the stripper really likes him.” Den Hollander was once the butt of a joke on a segment for “The Colbert Report.” On Fox News, however, he was greeted as a hero, brought on to claim that women “are a suspect class” who “walk all over [men] in their stiletto heels.”
But this shooting is a sobering reminder of a grim reality, which is that the misogyny that Den Hollander was peddling can far too easily go dark and turn to violence. Cheered on by an online community of bitter woman-haters who blame feminism for all their woes, men like Den Hollander frequently turn to outright terrorism against institutions and communities who didn’t give them all the goodies to which they think their sex entitles them.
The case that Den Hollander had before Salas, a suit challenging the fact that Selective Service registration only applies to young men, was yet another feeble effort to prove that men are the victims of sex discrimination, even though there hasn’t been a draft in decades. Nonetheless, Salas actually allowed the case to go forward, even though Den Hollander called her a “lazy and incompetent Latina judge appointed by Obama” on his website in 2019. The case was transferred to other lawyers last year.
Whatever the details of this tragic incident may be, the larger takeaway is obvious: Den Hollander was just the latest in a long line of men who would rather blame feminism than themselves for their personal failings, and who lash out violently at the world in acts of murder or terrorism.
The most famous of these, of course, was Elliot Rodger, who went on a 2014 shooting spree in Isla Vista, California, killing six people and injuring 14 others, apparently seeking revenge for his perception that “you girls have never been attracted to me.” Rodger identified as an “incel,” which is short for “involuntarily celibate” but better describes an ideology of men who believe that, because of feminism, they are being denied sex with women of the “hotness” caliber they believe they deserve.
There have been plenty more such attacks: Chris Harper-Mercer murdered nine people at an Oregon community college in 2017, citing Rodger as an influence. Scott Beierle shot up a yoga studio in Florida in 2018, killing two women and injuring four other people. Alek Minassian ran his van into a crowd in Toronto in 2018, killing 10 people and injuring 16, and also cited Rodger as an influence. Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda threw a 5-year-old boy over a railing at the Mall of America in a fit of outrage that women wouldn’t have sex with him. Earlier this year, a teenager who identified as an “incel” attacked women in a Toronto massage parlor, killing one. In May, 20-year-old “incel” Armando Hernandez live-streamed his shooting spree at an Arizona shopping mall, apparently targeting heterosexual couples. Just last month, another “incel” blew his hand off trying to make a bomb designed to kill “hot cheerleaders”.
Well before Rodger, there was George Sodini, who shot up a gym in suburban Pittsburgh in 2009, killing three women and injuring nine others. He was angry because — guess what! — he felt entitled to sex with the gym-toned women he saw there, and wasn’t getting any.
Den Hollander is also part of a long line of men who target judges and courts, believing that “the system” is out to get them because they’ve lost legal battles with ex-wives or have faced charges of violence against women.
One such man, Thomas Ball, set himself on fire outside a New Hampshire courthouse in 2011, apparently to protest his wife’s divorce proceedings and court rulings against him. In a posthumous manifesto mailed to a newspaper, he blamed those things on “the man-hating feminists” who allegedly run the government. Ball’s manifesto, however, hints at the real reasons: He admitted he had “slapped” his 4-year-old daughter badly enough to bust open her lip, which he considered a minor transgression but most normal people would view as child abuse.
Ball’s dramatic suicide became a rallying point for the “men’s rights” community, who saw him as a martyr to their cause, rather than a self-pitying, narcissistic, violent misogynist. Ball’s manifesto was posted on sites like A Voice for Men and his call to burn down courthouses was treated as inspirational.
This reaction to misogynist violence is standard in the world of “men’s rights” and “incels” and other online forums where men who hate women gather to talk about how they are society’s real victims. After Sodini’s murders, Tracy Clark-Flory, writing for Salon, found that the online world of “pick-up artists” — a related flavor of men who feel entitled to sex and are bitter they don’t get as much as they want — was sympathetic to this murderer, seeing him as a hapless victim instead of a vicious killer. Rodger’s long, self-pitying manifesto has become something of a Bible to the “incel” community, who often refer to him as “Saint Elliot.”
Despite all this, the media still tends to cover these acts of misogynist violence as isolated events perpetrated by “lone wolf” oddballs, instead of as lethal outbursts from a semi-organized movement that engages in “stochastic terrorism,” in which political leaders or movement activists deliberately use provocative and inciting language in hopes of inspiring their followers to commit acts of terrorism (while maintaining some shreds of plausible deniability).
(Let’s not forget the long history of violence against abortion providers, a different but related expression of male violence meant to control and punish women for wanting autonomy.)
Online misogynists are spread out over various websites and forums, but they are a discernible movement, just as surely as the “boogaloo” and other white supremacist movements that work in the same way. They have their own jargon, tropes and core beliefs — and they share an enthusiasm for celebrating individual acts of mayhem or terrorism, in hopes of encouraging more.
But when Reddit recently brought down the hammer on hate speech, in reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement, getting rid of forums like The_Donald that traffic in racist hate speech, they mostly ignored the dozens of forums dedicated to fomenting misogynist hatred.
It’s easy to see why. As past coverage of Den Hollander’s career makes clear, men who hate women are too easily normalized in our society, and are too often the objects of pity and sympathy rather than seen as the bigots they are. Sympathy for the incel murderer has even reached the pages of the New York Times, as when conservative columnist writer Ross Douthat wrote pityingly of “the unhappiness of incels” and their exclusion from the sexual marketplace, instead of seeing them for what they are, misogynists outraged that women now have the right to say no.
Philosopher Kate Manne coined the term “himpathy” for such sympathetic reactions that center the feelings of men, even truly odious men, over those of women, who, after all, are still being subject to sexual harassment, sexual assault and domestic violence at alarming rates. While the himpathizers often present themselves as trying to find a solution to the problem — if we could only get those incels laid, maybe they wouldn’t hurt women! — in reality, this attitude only reinforces the real problem, which is male entitlement.
A man like Den Hollander was fun to laugh at, no doubt. His entitlement, as a middle-aged man who expected the sexual worship of college-aged girls, was undeniably hilarious. But his presence in forums like Fox News, still the nation’s highest-rated cable news network, demonstrated that there’s still considerable social support for his core belief — one shared by an increasingly bitter and violent online community — that women exist to serve men and that their reluctance to be servile is a violation of men’s rights. The #MeToo movement has done a lot in recent years to help dismantle this view, but we clearly have a long way to go.

0,2020-07-21T17:21:11+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/conservative-activist-explains-how-psychologically-broken-trump-has-reshaped-the-republican-party/,Conservative activist explains how ‘psychologically broken’ Trump ‘has reshaped the Republican Party’,"When Fox News’ Chris Wallace interviewed President Donald Trump on Friday, July 17, he wasn’t shy about asking tough questions. According to Never Trump conservative Peter Wehner, one of the biggest takeaways from the interview is how bitter Trump sounded. That bitterness, Wehner stresses in a July 21 article for The Atlantic, will be remembered as Trump’s #1 contribution to the Republican Party.
When Wallace asked Trump how he will regard his years as president, Trump responded, “I think I was very unfairly treated. From before I even won, I was under investigation by a bunch of thieves, crooks. It was an illegal investigation.” And that obsession with grievance, according to Wehner, speaks volumes about how Trump views the world and the ways in which he has reshaped the GOP.
“Donald Trump is a psychologically broken, embittered and deeply unhappy man,” writes Wehner, a senior fellow at the right-wing Ethics and Public Policy Center. “He is so gripped by his grievances, such a prisoner of his resentments, that even the most benevolent question from an interviewer — what good parts of your presidency would you like to be remembered for? — triggered a gusher of discontent.”
Trump, Wehner argues, is the most influential Republican president since Ronald Reagan — although not in a good way.
“In a single term, Trump has reshaped the Republican Party through and through, and his dispositional imprint on the GOP is as great as any in modern history, including Ronald Reagan,” Wehner argues. “I say that as a person who was deeply shaped by Reagan and his presidency. My first job in government was working for the Reagan Administration, when I was in my twenties. The conservative movement in the 1980s, while hardly flawless, was intellectually serious and politically optimistic. And Reagan himself was a man of personal decency, grace and class.”
While Reagan was known for his optimism and his “morning in America” speeches, Wehner writes, Trump’s legacy is one of anger and grievance.
“There were certainly ugly elements on the American right during the Reagan presidency, and Reagan himself was not without flaws,” Wehner explains. “But as president, he set the tone, and the tone was optimism, courtliness and elegance, joie de vivre. He has since been replaced by the crudest and cruelest man ever to be president.”
Reaganism, Wehner laments, has been replaced by Trumpism in the GOP.
The Never Trumper writes, “Donald Trump is a vindictive man who also happens to be commander in chief and head of the executive branch…. One senses in Donald Trump no joy, no delight, no laughter. All the emotions that drive him are negative ones. There is something repugnant about Trump, yes, but there is also something quite sad about the man. He is a damaged soul.”

0,2020-07-21T16:34:33+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/fox-news-pundit-issues-dire-warning-for-republicans-dont-kid-yourselves-democratic-voters-are-very-enthusiastic-about-kicking-trump-out-of-office/,Fox News pundit issues dire warning for Republicans: Don’t kid yourselves — Democratic voters are ‘very enthusiastic’ about kicking Trump out of office,"When supporters of President Donald Trump see him trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in poll after poll, one of the things they say to console themselves is: yes, but Trump voters still have very high enthusiasm — much more than all the Democratic voters who aren’t crazy about having Biden as a nominee. But Fox News’ Brian K. Arbour, in an op-ed published on their website on July 21, warns Republicans and Trump supporters that they should not kid themselves about Democratic voters — who, he stresses, are “very enthusiastic” in 2020 and really want to see Trump voted out of office in November.
Arbour, who teaches political science at John Jay College/City University of New York, notes that Bill Stepien —Trump’s new campaign manager — recently wrote, “There is clear and irrefutable evidence that Joe Biden’s candidacy has a decided lack of enthusiastic support as compared to President Trump.” And Arbour argues that it’s a huge mistake to underestimate Democratic disdain for Trump — even among Democratic voters who don’t consider Biden their dream candidate.
“If one broadens the definition of enthusiasm beyond desire to support your side’s presidential candidate,” Arbour writes, “this argument weakens. Using a more diverse set of evidence, including turnout in primary elections and donations to candidates up and down the ballot, one can find lots of evidence of Democratic enthusiasm for this year’s election.”
Arbour agrees with Stepien that enthusiasm for Trump is high among his supporters and that Democratic voters aren’t nearly as enthusiastic about Biden.
“By that definition — being excited about the choice for president — there is indeed an enthusiasm gap,” Arbour writes. “But if we look at other indicators, we see lots of evidence for enthusiasm among Democrats.”
Biden may not be the ideal choice of Democratic voters, Arbour writes, but in terms of overall enthusiasm, they are fired up — and that enthusiasm is showing itself with everything from “fundraising” to “turnout.”
Arbour observes, “Last week, the Biden campaign announced that it had raised $282 million in the second quarter of 2020 — $16 million more than the Trump campaign…. Democratic fundraising success at the presidential level was matched at the congressional level…. Since June, Democrats have seen big increases in the number of votes cast in presidential primaries in Georgia.”
Another sign of “Democratic enthusiasm,” according to Arbour, is their “dislike for President Trump.” Arbour notes that according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 90% of Democrats disapprove of Trump — 79% of them strongly.
“It is easy to explain Democratic anger at President Trump,” Arbour notes. “While Republicans feel conflicted between President Trump’s conservative policy achievements and his personal behavior, Democrats feel no such ambivalence. They object to both and see Trump’s election as a worrisome sign of democratic health in our country.”
Arbour concludes his op-ed by emphasizing that Republicans should not underestimate how badly Democrats want to see Trump out of the White House.
“Republicans may take solace in the low levels of enthusiasm that Joe Biden’s voters are recording for Joe Biden, but a look at a broader set of numbers indicates that such sentiments may lead to the wrong conclusion,” Arbour warns Trump supporters. “Democrats seem very enthusiastic about a candidate this fall, but that candidate is Donald Trump. Democratic voters want him out of office, and they are indeed enthusiastic about making that happen.”

0,2020-07-21T16:06:45+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/iowa-gov-kim-reynolds-turns-hawkeye-state-into-trumps-petri-dish/,Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds turns Hawkeye State into Trump’s petri dish,"On the same day that Iowa marked its highest number of COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, after three weeks of rapid increase, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds defended her refusal to pass a statewide mask requirement and issued a proclamation mandating that all public schools provide in-person classes within weeks.
Employing the Orwellian rhetoric of the Trump administration, Reynolds hailed the “important milestones in our recovery,” just as an unpublished report from the White House Coronavirus Task Force ranked Iowa as one of 18 “red zone” states that lacked stringent enough mask rules and social-distancing regulations.
It gets stranger: Iowans can’t even visit Chicago now, according to a new emergency travel rule imposed by the Chicago Department of Public Health, unless they agree to a 14-day quarantine.
Iowa is not just a state in denial — it’s quickly descendng into a state of negligence.
On a state level, Iowa’s testing procedures have been wracked with delays and errors.  En route to work with the governor and the legislature, two state lawmakers had to retake their coronavirus tests, due to “damaged” samples. Last week, state auditor Rob Sands issued a report that found Iowa’s no-bid contract with an out-of-state company violates state law through its four-step rerouting of test results, which are reportedly sent first to Utah before reaching Iowa health officials, and cause an “unnecessary risk of error, equipment failure, maladministration, [and] outright falsification.”
But it’s not just incompetence that plagues Iowa — or the mind-boggling antics of a right-wing legislature intent on passing the most extreme laws on abortion and guns that sporadically push our state into the national headlines. (In case you missed it, even blind people have a right to own and use guns in Iowa, according to a 2011 state law.)
Iowa has become the petri dish of the Trump White House’s reckless policies.
When the White House issued an executive order in late April, invoking the Defense Production Act to keep open all meatpacking plants during the worst moment of the pandemic outbreak in the industry, Reynolds flew to the White House within days to pass on her “sincere thanks.”
Even as the virus ravaged meatpacking plants in Iowa, Trump and Vice President Pence hailed Reynolds and her state as a “success story” for testing and mitigation. Our governor’s glowing response:  “We’ve turned the corner.”
A week later, Iowa meatpacking plants ranked the worst in the nation in an independent assessment. With more than 1,300 cases, a single meatpacking plant in Waterloo, Iowa, still ranks in the top 15 worst clusters, according to an analysis by the New York Times. Families of three deceased meatpackers are now suing the Tyson company for knowingly and intentionally putting “profits over the health, safety and well-being of their Waterloo employees.”
When the White House demanded last week that all children attend school in the fall, contradicting Centers for Disease Control guidance, Reynolds responded within hours, jettisoning her long-time advocacy for local control and rejecting local district policies in Des Moines, Iowa City and other cities. Instead, she demanded that “all state agencies, school districts, and other local governmental bodies and agencies shall take all efforts to prepare to safely welcome back students and teachers to school in-person this fall.”
When the Trump administration reneged on promises to include exemptions for ethanol in the final renewable fuel standard last December, angering Iowa corn farmers, Reynolds deflected any criticism of the White House, instead placing the blame on the Environmental Protection Agency.
Last spring, Reynolds couldn’t even bring herself to defend the state’s impressive wind energy policies when Trump visited the state and famously declared that the wind turbines “cause” cancer. Reynolds crafted a painstakingly nonsensical response: It wasn’t “her place” to counter the president, she said. “You know how those things change — one year coffee is good for you, the next year coffee causes cancer. I mean, that’s just what happens.”
No, things don’t just happen in Iowa. We’re used to a lot of political doublespeak and crap. (A research engineer with the University of Iowa recently found that the state’s nearly 24 million hogs produced more fecal waste per square mile than the entire state of California; in a state of 3 million people, the porcine population pumped out waste equivalent to that produced by 83.7 million.)
When the governor’s car recently struck a Black Lives Matter protester in Des Moines, Reynolds called it an appropriate action.
As executive of one of the few states to refuse to enact a COVID-19 lockdown or issue statewide mask requirements, Reynolds likes to say she “believes in Iowans.” Last week, though, the longtime spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Health was forced out of office, thanks to her efforts to provide more information to journalists. “Response to this pandemic has become political and I think we’ve seen that all across the country,” lamented Polly Carver-Kimm, who had spent 12 years in her role as the state spokesperson.
But playing politics with wind turbines and pigs and corn, notwithstanding Iowa’s devastating role in contaminating the Gulf of Mexico’s “dead zone,” has its limits when a failing state government requires your children to attend school in a time of a deadly pandemic.
In May, Reynolds made national news with her bizarre disclaimer that we couldn’t afford to “prioritize lives over livelihoods.” She insisted business must go on.
But the lives of children are our priorities. Iowa’s governor may want to make our children the experimental subjects in Donald Trump’s heartland petri dish, but Iowans won’t stand for it anymore.

Householder ran for office in 2018, saying: “I’m a Pro-Gun, Pro-Life, Christian Conservative with the highest NRA rating in Ohio’s history.”
Also arrested were an advisor to the Speaker, the state’s former GOP chairman, a former Ohio Civil Rights commissioner, a consultant, and Neil Clark, who boasts of being “one of the best-connected lobbyists in Columbus” on his company’s website.
A spokesperson for U.S. Attorney David DeVillers described the case as a “public corruption racketeering conspiracy involving $60 million,” the Cincinnati Enquirer also reports.
Saying, “this is about right and wrong,” Householder drew headlines last year when he attacked the Ohio Library Council, and a local library for being “a resource for teenage boys to learn how to dress in drag.”
I sent this letter to the Ohio Library Council today. Our public libraries are great resources for young & old alike. But they should not be a resource for teenage boys to learn how to dress in drag. I demand it stop now !!! pic.twitter.com/uL2ujHZU3a
— Speaker Larry Householder (@HouseholderOH) May 31, 2019
The library had scheduled an event for teens which was to “include a drag queen makeup tutorial, crafts, a safe-sex program, and games,” NewNowNext reported. The event was relocated.
DeVillers has scheduled a 2:30 PM local time press conference.

0,2020-07-21T15:45:53+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/dhs-engages-in-spying-on-domestic-targets-as-trump-prepares-to-send-police-to-more-cities/,DHS engages in spying on domestic targets as Trump prepares to send police to more cities,"The Department of “But wait, I never expected that leopard to eat my face” has long been one of the busiest in Washington. Great power may be wedded to great responsibility in the comic books, but in real life … it’s a sure thing that extraordinary authority or ability will be, sooner or later, misused. Procedures designed for emergencies will be employed day to day. Laws created for the most severe circumstances will be deployed against the most trivial offenses. Systems built for the military will roll down city streets.
And, as we’re seeing right now in the streets of Portland, an agency gifted with extraordinary access to resources and information with the explicit intent of protecting the nation from the threat of international terrorists, will end up battering the faces of mothers and veterans in the cause of defeating … graffiti. That includes using intelligence resources and surveillance capability meant to dig Osama bin Laden out of a mountain fastness to monitor the activities of peaceful protesters in the United States.
Lawfare reported on Monday evening that they have obtained documents showing that the Department of Homeland Security is collecting information on protesters and planning “targeting monuments, memorials, and statues.” That collection includes drafting a legal cover to allow “expanded intelligence activities necessary to mitigate the significant threat to homeland security.” That’s right—spray paint is now a significant threat to the nation, one so severe that it allows DHS to draft legal cover created in the shadow of 9/11.
In a throwback to the worst actions of the FBI during the Civil Rights actions of the 1950s and ’60s, this document shows that parts of the intelligence community meant to deal with terrorism have been turned inward, not against the proven-violent threat posed by white nationalist organizations, but against protesters involved in the reaction to the police murder of George Floyd and the push to remove Confederate monuments from public sites.
Acting DHS official Ken Cuccinelli—who, like acting director Chad Wolf, has never been officially nominated for his position or subject to Senate review—insists that the government is aware of unspecified “intelligence about planned attacks on federal facilities.” But, as Lawfare makes clear, the assumed authority to conduct intelligence operations against Americans “covers significantly more” that just Cuccinelli’s claims. It includes, at least, monitoring planned marches and activities regarding Confederate symbols and monuments that are not on federal property. DHS has—in a document that is not even classified—made clear that it is deploying powers that were always subject to abuse, in defense of the symbols of racism, wherever they sneer down from their marble mounts.
But of course, the intelligence gathering aspect is just one way in which DHS is being misused. As The Washington Post reports,Trump is very proud of the brutality and chemical agents that the untrained forces have deployed in Portland. “In Portland, they’ve done a fantastic job,” said Trump. “They’ve been there three days, and they really have done a fantastic job in very short period of time. No problem. They grab them, a lot of people in jail. They’re leaders. These are anarchists. These are not protesters.”
This is how Trump presents what appears to be the random selection of people off the street, some of them far away from any federal facility, and throwing them into unmarked cars to be held without access to attorneys or any formal charges. DHS has admitted that the forces in Portland have no training with either dealing with protests or even normal criminal proceedings. And it shows.
Trump and Wolf have made it clear that the intention is to expand this occupation to other cities where Trump claims “dangerous anarchists” are in control. What may be the most extraordinary thing about this incredible step is just how openly Trump is handing out unchecked authority to deal with trivial offenses in defense of blatantly racist symbols. For as many times as Trump has raged about “MS-13” or drug lords on the southern border, it’s not those threats that have generated this massive expansion of federal authority—it’s people who think a century and a half of official veneration of slavery is more than enough.
But the extraordinary surveillance actions and invasion of federal forces into American cities isn’t the end of this assault. There’s another vital flank on Fox News, talk radio, and right-wing media. With edited photo, endlessly replayed clips, and footage lifted from completely unconnected incidents, the Fox audience has been sold the idea that American cities have descended into chaos for months. It wasn’t a part of Seattle occupied by people handing out free pizza and medical care, it was the entire city overrun by screaming anarchists firebombing buildings and shooting police. It’s not a wall of local moms trying to prevent Trump’s secret police in Portland from launching another random assault on protesters, it is, of course, an army of antifa terrorists ready to burn America to the ground.
There’s a reason that the gun-waving couple from St. Louis have become regularly interviewed stars on Fox. It’s not just that they’ve been made heroes of the Second Amendment, but that the fear and expectation of violence they displayed is exactly what the Fox audience has been sold. The fear of fellow Americans created on Fox is an essential support for Trump that is almost entirely invisible for anyone watching an actual news network.
As the Post makes absolutely clear, Donald Trump is, “leveraging a manufactured excuse to use military and quasi-military forces for his political benefit—just as the White House ordered a group of peaceful protesters to be cleared from a plaza in Washington so Trump could visit a church for a photo op.”
Washington, D.C. was the proof of concept. Portland is the beta test. What Trump has learned is that Republicans in Congress will still back his every play, and Fox is always willing to stand in support of racism. Now the rollout is coming across America.

0,2020-07-21T15:00:59+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/most-incompetent-state-leadership-in-the-us-these-6-governors-make-the-case/,Most incompetent state leadership in the US? These 6 governors make the case,"There is a battle right now for the absolute worst governor in America and, unsurprisingly to readers of this website, all the top contenders are from the Republican Party. Let’s review.
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem
First up is South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. She resisted stay-at-home orders in April, leading to a massive outbreak. In June, she released a video calling for “more freedom, not more government” while lashing out at the media. In July, she hosted Donald Trump himself for a no-mask appearance that was more of a campaign rally at Mount Rushmore. Noem had previously asked Trump to overturn the ban on fireworks around the monument. The ban went into effect after a pine beetle invasion devastated the area, leaving lots of dry timber to fuel fires, and because of concerns that fireworks debris was poisoning groundwater. Never mind it all, Noem and Trump wanted a big show of freedumb with no masks, even during one of the worst health crises in American history. For what it’s worth, there were rumors Trump liked her so much he was considering replacing Mike Pence with Noem, although people in Trump’s orbit later shut that down.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds
Next up is Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds: another governor who resisted shutting things down to flatten the curve and then oversaw a spike, mostly in agricultural sectors where immigrants working at meat processing plants bore the brunt of the outbreak. Today she is drawing the ire of teachers and school administrators after she abruptly changed the state’s policies and demanded students attend in-person this fall for at least half the regular school days. As noted in the Des Moines Register, this has sent parents and teachers into “chaos.” The paper notes it is the “most concrete misstep in addressing the next school year. It throws into chaos families’ expectations about school as they continue to confront rampant uncertainty about COVID-19 in many other aspects of their lives.”
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp
And now we head further south, where the top contenders all reside. Crossing over the Mason-Dixon line, we have Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia. He rode into office on a wave of voter suppression, suppression that he directly created and implemented in his previous role as secretary of state. Kemp proudly resisted shutdown orders until the data clearly showed that the virus was beginning to spiral out of control. We were fully into the month of April and full-blown efforts to “flatten the curve” when Kemp held a press conference saying he’d just learned asymptomatic people could spread the disease, something the rest of us were all aware of because we listened to the scientists from the start. Making this even worse, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are headquartered in Atlanta. All he had to do was consult with literally anyone at the CDC for this information.
And when Donald Trump saw his poll numbers beginning to slide and started barking about ordering everything to open back up, Kemp was right there to lead the charge. When Trump’s charge to reopen was criticized and his numbers slumped even more, he quickly threw Kemp under the bus, criticizing him for reopening too soon. Even today, as the science is clear as day that masks are critical in reducing the spread of the disease, Gov. Brian Kemp has the gall to sue Atlanta for requiring masks in the city. Bless his heart.
Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt
Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt flouts mask recommendations with his family
When that COVID wind came sweeping down the plains, Gov. Kevin Stitt largely refused to wear a mask. Sure he was telling folks in March they were “safer at home,” but over on his Twitter account, he was proudly defying expert advice to stay home, avoid indoor spaces, and wear masks, sharing photos of his family out to dinner in a crowded restaurant. He has since deleted this tweet after announcing on July 15 that he is the first governor in the country to test positive for COVID.
And while the restaurant photo drew national attention, that same week he shared photos at a junior livestock show that took place indoors, with not a mask in sight.
Stitt was one of a handful of attendees to test positive since attending Trump’s hilariously disastrous comeback rally in Tulsa, which predicatbly sparked an outbreak in the Tulsa area.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis
And now onto Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, or as he is now called on Twitter: Ron DeathSantis or Rona DeSantis. In late May, DeSantis appeared with Vice President Mike Pence in Florida to spike the ball, raging against the media for what he called “knee-jerk headlines” after images from crowded Florida beaches went viral. He was basically claiming victory over an enemy that was, in reality, just getting started. When he raged at the media on May 20, Florida was averaging 527 new cases per day. Today the Sunshine State reported 10,347 new cases, the sixth consecutive day in a row the state has exceeded 10,000 new cases a day. On Sunday, Florida topped 5,000 deaths. For what it’s worth, in early May, experts estimated Florida would have 5,440 deaths by Aug. 4. DeSantis brushed it off, calling it “conjecture.” Turns out that estimate was low.
Even with all of that, DeSantis is insisting schools remain open five days a week this fall. Today, Florida’s largest teachers union filed a lawsuit over the reopening order.
Missouri Gov. Mike Parson
And that leads us to the Show Me State of Missouri, where Gov. Mike Parson has shown himself to be a total buffoon. You might be thinking, even worse than DeSantis? I’m here to to sadly affirm this to be true. As a lifelong Kansas Citian (from both sides of this Kansas-Missouri state line), it is hard to understate just how embarrassed and frankly how frightened I am to live in this state right now. Like Donald Trump, Mike Parson seems intent on inflicting maximum harm on the residents of the state’s urban centers. From sending the National Guard to Kansas City during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests (which served only to turn up the temperature of protesters, instantly creating tension and conflict where there had been very little), to vowing to pardon the St. Louis couple who pointed guns at peaceful protesters as they walked down the street in front of their tacky St. Louis mansion if charges end up being filed in the case, Parson keeps lowering the bar.
Then there was the embarrassing display at the White House, where he slathered praise on Donald Trump during a made-for-television July 7 meeting on reopening. His comments were widely mocked both nationally and back home in Missouri. Shortly after traveling to D.C., Parson returned home for a steak fry event—no masks, no social distancing, and with most of the programming taking place indoors. This happened in mid-July 2020, with all the information we have about how this disease spreads.
Teresa and I enjoyed a great evening with friends at the 17th annual @MoCattle’s Association Steak Fry. pic.twitter.com/0pVyJpLixt
— Governor Mike Parson (@GovParsonMO) July 12, 2020
And don’t even get me started on his steak cooking. What he did is a disgrace to good steaks everywhere.
From the start of the COVID-19 crisis, Parson’s leadership has been abysmal. As the entire nation was heading into a shutdown and every public health expert on the planet was cautioning for social-distancing, staying in, and avoiding indoor spaces, Parson was sending the exact opposite message to his constituents. This was Mike Parson on March 15.
Teresa and I joined our family this morning to pray for our state and for our county on this National Day of Prayer. pic.twitter.com/XUHIFBJV4g
— Governor Mike Parson (@GovParsonMO) March 15, 2020
No masks, indoor space, defying all public health experts: It is no wonder Missouri ranks dead last in state public health funding. And I do mean dead last, because Missourians die due to these budgetary decisions.
Finally, in an interview on Monday with conservative radio host Marc Cox, Parson insisted children go back to school full-time and that children who contract COVID will simply be sent home. “These kids have got to get back to school. They’re at the lowest risk possible. And if they do get COVID-19, which they will — and they will when they go to school — they’re not going to the hospitals. They’re not going to have to sit in doctor’s offices. They’re going to go home and they’re going to get over it.”
And that, my friends, was the icing on the freedumb cake for me and why I had to move Mike Parson to the top of the list. Where does Mike Parson think those kids are going? They are going home to mom and dad. They are going home to grandparents who live in the home. They are very, very likely to spread it to their teachers and support staff. Where are those adults supposed to go? What are the protocols when a teacher contracts COVID? Is there testing available in each school? How many substitute teachers are willing to take their place? Sen. Elizabeth Warren rightly took Parson to task for his comments on reopening schools, saying, “This is willfully endangering our kids—and entire communities—for political gain. Forcing schools to reopen without providing them with the resources they need to do so safely is reckless, dangerous, and the last thing we should do.”
So how does your governor stack up? Who did I miss? Sound off in the comments below. For those of you who don’t live in South Dakota, Iowa, Georgia, Oklahoma, Florida, or Missouri, what is it like having a governor who isn’t a mouth-breathing, science-denying, anti-life, authoritarian-praising, bad steak-cooking incompetent?

And in Detroit, a police officer who, according to prosecutors, fired rubber bullets at three journalists during a protest in late May is now facing felony assault charges.
The Detroit Free Press’ Frank Witsil reports that on Monday, July 20, 32-year-old Detroit police officer Daniel Debono was charged with multiple accounts of felony assault. Debono is facing nine counts altogether: three accounts per journalist.
According to prosecutor Kym Worthy, “The evidence shows that these three journalists were leaving the protest area and that there was almost no one else on the street where they were. They were a threat to no one. There are simply no explicable reasons why the alleged actions of this officer were taken.”
Debono, who is presently suspended with pay, could be sentenced to up to four years in prison if convicted. The journalists Debono is accused of assaulting with rubber bullets are 30-year-old Nicole Hester, 29-year-old Matthew Hatcher and 28-year-old Seth Herald — all of whom, according to Worthy, wore press credentials.
Witsil reports, “They identified themselves as members of the press, had their hands up and asked to cross the street. As the three began to cross, Debono is accused of firing his weapon at them, striking all of three with rubber pellets. The shooting, Worthy said, was unprovoked.”
According to Worthy, Herald suffered a wrist injury — while Hester suffered face, neck, arm and leg injuries. And Hatcher’s face was bruised.
The injuries that Hester, Hatcher and Herald suffered in Detroit are not the first time police have drawn criticism for their abusive treatment of journalists who were covering the Floyd protests. At a protest in Louisville, Kentucky, journalist Kaitlin Rust and her cameraman were shot with rubber bullets by police, according to CNN. And in Minneapolis, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez — along with a producer and a photographer — were arrested and handcuffed by police but later released.

0,2020-07-21T14:12:12+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-how-trump-will-try-to-rig-the-election/,Here’s how Trump will try to rig the election,"By now, it’s relatively easy to forecast Donald Trump’s tyrannical moves. There are no advanced Frank Underwood-style chess gambits in play here. It’s barely Candyland, despite the fascistic goals involved. Trump is, on top of it all, a simple-minded, easily predictable Golgothan who telegraphs every move of self-preservation. Sometimes it can be reassuring to have a sense of where he’s going with his repetitious blurts. At other times it leaves us with this perpetual sense of instability, knowing what might be lurking around the corner. The November election fits horrifyingly into the latter category.
I believe I know how Trump will try to interfere with the process as well as the outcome, and it’s more than a little unnerving, especially given the cataclysmic stakes this time. Warning: This is a bit of a horror show, so hang on tight. Oh, and everything that follows presumes a close race, with the advantage leaning in Joe Biden’s direction.
We’re all brutally aware that every move Trump makes is aimed squarely at re-election. If he’s not re-elected, he could face criminal prosecution and dozens of lawsuits after he returns to being a private citizen. He knows better than anyone that the presidency is the only thing saving him either from the slammer or from an underground escape to a non-extradition country.
As part of his herky-jerky maneuvers to evade legal jeopardy, we also know he’s willing to sentence hundreds of thousands of Americans to death, and millions more on top of that to suffer from permanent pre-existing conditions, due to his near-genocidal indifference to the pandemic — indifference aimed at manipulating the stock market and thereby boosting in his re-election chances. It’s a matter of historical record that he was impeached by Congress and put on trial for trying to cheat in the election, while refusing to discourage Russia from cyber-attacking the process again.
You get the point. He’s capable of doing anything in order to win, even risking his legal future. But none of the above tactics directly addresses how he might handle the actual process of suppressing and overturning votes.
Like a petulant boy who tosses a board game across the room when he’s losing, Trump is going to hurl the election process into absolute chaos. Here’s how: He’ll continue to suppress voting by discouraging absentee voting, while benefiting from new and existing roadblocks to in-person voting. Then, on and after Election Day, he’ll sue to try and stop absentee ballots from being counted.
You might’ve seen the unintentionally hilarious video of Trump on “Fox News Sunday” last weekend. During his sweaty, lie-filled exchange with Chris Wallace, the president once again repeated, “I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election.” He also said that he might not accept the outcome of the election. “I have to see,” Trump said when pressed on the question. Absentee voting, also known as “mail-in” voting, will be his primary target in his plan to derail the election. (Point of order: all mail-in ballots are absentee, including the president’s ballots. I will therefore use the term “absentee” from this point forward.)
Election Day won’t be a “day” at all. In fact, some estimates suggest we won’t know the winner of the presidential election, let alone contested Senate and House races, for a week or more after Nov. 3, mainly due to the record number of absentee ballots used during pandemic conditions. It’ll take days to electronically tabulate all those votes, and maybe weeks for hand-counted ballots in some precincts. I’m not even factoring in the possibility of recanvassing or actual recounts.
So far, there are 34 states, including the District of Columbia, allow some form of voting by mail without an excuse for one’s absence. (Oregon has conducted all elections by mail since 1998, with no significant problems. Colorado and Washington state have adopted universal vote-by-mail more recently.) By the way, the absentee voting states include Florida, where Trump will be voting by mail this year — again, with no excuse needed. The other 17 states require an excuse, but at least some of those will likely change the rules before November, eliminating the need for an excuse.
The main focus of Trump’s shrieking about absentee voting, of course, is to establish a hearts-and-minds framework to support legal challenges against those ballots. To that end, he’s routinely exploiting the bully pulpit to manufacture doubt about the reliability of absentee voting. From there, he’s capable of launching a series of lawsuits against boards of elections — perhaps in every state where absentee ballots are used, or just in states with margins too close to call or individual counties with narrow margins. As long as he continues to hammer his loyalists about the evils of absentee voting between now and Election Day, they’ll be increasingly likely to back him up during the actual process, organizing demonstrations and maybe a few “Brooks Brothers riots” not unlike Election 2000.
Any and all swing states will be ripe for legal challenges — not because of actual election or voter fraud but simply because Trump believes there’s fraud taking place. (Or, to be more accurate, because he claims to believe that.)
The other point is to discourage the use of absentee ballots, with the broader goal of convincing pro-Trump state officials to roll back existing absentee rules. After all, it’s much more difficult to monkey around with absentee votes that, by definition, include a paper trail. On the other hand, in-person votes cast on electronic voting machines are more susceptible to manipulation and hacking, whether by Russian agents or someone else, and we all know about Trump’s business partners in Moscow and their track record with American elections. In his desperation, Trump will be eager to meddle with every voting format, covering all his bases.
Challenge after challenge could rocket-propel the entire election back into the hands of the Supreme Court, home of the infamous Bush v. Gore decision, and there’s no guarantee that Chief Justice John Roberts will swing the way we hope he will. Irrespective of where Trump’s legal challenges land, he will absolutely use the courts as a delaying action, making for a hell of a long process at a time when the patience of the American people is practically nonexistent.
Electors are supposed to cast their ballots on Dec. 14, based on the results of the popular vote. If there’s an actual declared winner by that date, I’ll be shocked. Trump’s legal challenges will be thick and he’s shown zero compunction to give up. (See also his relentless legal challenges to protect his tax returns from prosecutors and congressional oversight.)
It’s also possible that Trump’s indefinite deployment of federal stormtroopers in selected cities will discourage some voters from turning out. Trump’s screeching has also suggested that he might order ICE and CBP goons to monitor polling places, which could discourage Latino citizens or other recent immigrants from voting.
One more thing: As the days following the election descend into chaos, it wouldn’t shock me if Trump simply declared victory before all the votes are counted. That won’t mean much in the grand scheme, but it will further incite his people and worsen the chaos.
I don’t know how all this will end, but I feel relatively secure in forecasting the mayhem. Honestly, as with everything Trump, I hope I’m wrong and this election wraps up without a glitch. But given King Joffrey the Flaccid’s actions lately, especially with his contra-constitutional deployment of unidentified soldiers to disappear protesters from the streets, it would be foolish to count on a smooth ride. The absolute best strategy for the Democratic Party, and indeed all Normals, is to prepare for a bloody mess before we have a winner. The party ought to be fully lawyered up in anticipation of Trump’s psycho-bombs detonating at polling places and in state capitals across the country. Don’t be blindsided.
I think we can all agree that Donald Trump will not go quietly, or accept defeat with any measure of dignity. Knowing the stunts he’s likely pull, and preparing accordingly, is half the battle.

The doctor who developed it says questions were ‘supposed to be easy’,"In an interview with Fox News’ Chris Wallace that was filmed on Friday, July 17 and aired over the weekend, President Donald Trump bragged about his performance on a cognitive test and challenged former Vice President Joe Biden — the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — to take the same test. Trump insisted that parts of the test were quite difficult, but according to the doctor who developed the test, it was meant to be easy.
Developed by Dr. Ziad Nasreddine in 1996, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment or MoCA test is designed to screen for early signs of Alzheimer’s or dementia. Wallace, during his interview with Trump, reminded the president that MoCA was “not the hardest test” and noted some of the questions. But Trump disagreed, insisting that parts of MoCA were, in fact, challenging and urged Biden to “take a test right now.”
In an interview with Market Watch, Nasreddine confirmed that he didn’t intend for MoCA to be difficult. Nasreddine told Market Watch, “This is not an IQ test or the level of how a person is extremely skilled or not. The test is supposed to help physicians detect early signs of Alzheimer’s, and it became very popular because it was a short test — and very sensitive for early impairment.”
Nasreddine discussed some of the questions with Market Watch, including one in which the person taking the test is asked to draw an analog clock and depict a specific time — explaining, “You need planning and executive function and spatial skills to space the numbers on the clock correctly…. There are ‘traps’ that patients who have cognitive impairments fall into with this test.”
Other examples of MoCA questions, according to Market Watch’s Nicole Lyn Pesce, might range from the person being asked to describe the similarities between a watch and a ruler or being asked to identify some animals depicted in illustrations.
I’m a psychologist. I’ve administered this test (the MOCA) hundreds, if not thousands of times. Let me tell you, bragging about acing this test is the equivalent of bragging that you tied your own shoes this morning. https://t.co/ldzfcq9RGk

I see the president is bragging about “acing” the MoCA again. I’m a doctor, we use this test all the time. You can’t “ace” the MoCA. You either get perfect or we take away your driver’s license.
— Ty Berry (@tberry3) July 19, 2020
Pesce notes that Nasreddine and his “peers are growing increasingly concerned that the test might not be as accurate anymore, because too many elements have been shared online. This allows people to potentially practice the questions to perform better on the exam.”
Nasreddine told Market Watch that if someone performs poorly on MoCA, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the person has early onset Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia. However, Nasreddine noted that MoCA “is supposed to be easy for someone who has no cognitive impairment.”
“The purpose is to detect impairment,” Nasreddine explained. “It’s not meant to determine if someone has extremely high levels of abilities.”

0,2020-07-21T13:25:27+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/angry-and-broke-constituents-have-vulnerable-senate-republicans-at-odds-with-mcconnell-on-covid-19-relief/,Angry and broke constituents have vulnerable Senate Republicans at odds with McConnell on COVID-19 relief,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has his priorities for the next coronavirus relief bill: forcing kids back to school and protecting businesses—and schools—from liability if they end up killing people by reopening prematurely. Those are his priorities. His cadre of vulnerable Republicans seeking reelection this year have more pressing worries, like the tens if not hundreds of thousands of their constituents who are still unemployed and are about to lose the lifeline of expanded unemployment insurance (UI) benefits.
“We have to—together—get through this by making sure that people are able to get back to work, that businesses are able to survive, that individuals know that they’re going to be okay,” endangered Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado told The Washington Post. Good luck with that when you’ve got Grim Reaper Mitch McConnell and Trump leading the way. The freak-out impetus for Gardner and others is Trump’s move to keep coronavirus testing and tracing funds out of the next relief bill. The White House seems to have backed away from that, but the threat of whatever it is Trump’s going to try to pull next—and the knowledge that voters are very scared and very angry—is putting these senators on edge.
Gardner told the Post that his constituents are demanding more federal aid and the continued unemployment benefit boost, which he also supports extending. He is, however, open to reducing that benefit, which is now $600/week. He also said that he’s more than willing to listen to Democrats’ demands for more state and local aid, which McConnell is refusing unless it’s specifically tied to school reopening.
Sen. Susan Collins is also clamoring for more aid to her state, Maine, and for continued UI expansion. Trying to remount her “moderate” horse, Collins says that “now is not the time” to worry about how much Congress is spending to address the crisis or about that national debt. That’s how worried she is about reelection—she’s not even trying to play deficit peacock.
Meanwhile, their Democratic opponents are on offense. In one of Georgia’s races, Democrat Jon Ossof hit hard. “David Perdue and Donald Trump have nothing to run on but widespread disease, mass unemployment, a record of being wrong and being wrong such that Americans lose their lives, millions have lost their jobs,” he said. He’s not wrong. “David Perdue will lose in November when his record is exposed.” In Texas, MJ Hegar is finding a lot of room for hitting John Cornyn. “He said it was a mistake to expand unemployment insurance, and I’m not confident that he would support it again,” Hegar said in an interview with the Post. “That’s not a handout. That is our country, our capitalist economy responding to the economic crisis. So he should be thinking more about what is best for his constituents and not what Mitch McConnell tells him to say.”
That’s a message that’s going to be working for Democrats all over the country. No one wants to be McConnell’s rubber stamp any more.

Cohen’s attorneys claim his re-incarceration is retaliation by Barr over a book he is writing about President Trump, The Hill reports.
“He is being held in retaliation for his protected speech, including drafting a book manuscript that is critical of the President — and recently making public his intention to publish that book soon, shortly before the upcoming election,” the  suit claims.
He is asking to be released from jail immediately.
Cohen was returned to prison after refusing to sign a statement promising to not publish his book about Trump until after he had served out his sentence. He would also have to promise to not speak to reporters.
His lawsuit cites First Amendment issues. The ACLU is part of his legal team.

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Eighteen Senate Democrats on Monday asked a leading U.S. bank regulator to explain how his agency handled investigations into discrimination and “redlining” in the banking industry.
The letter, signed by Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, and the other lawmakers, comes after a story by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum recounting how six lending discrimination probes were dropped under President Donald Trump.
It calls on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to explain how it handled those cases and why the banks involved have not been sanctioned. “Without intervention by the OCC, countless consumers could be subject to discrimination with no way to know or seek redress,” the letter says.
The OCC abandoned investigations into Bank of America and five other lenders suspected of bias, ProPublica and The Capitol Forum reported. The Bank of America probe was shelved after corporate lawyers pushed back on examiners, according to the story.
The OCC, under Trump appointee Joseph Otting, declined to pursue the cases, often over the objections of OCC staff who wanted to see the banks punished, the news organizations reported.
In at least three instances, the OCC determined that the bias was so serious that it should be investigated with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, according to people familiar with the cases.
The OCC declined to comment on the investigations. In a statement to ProPublica and The Capitol Forum, Brian Brooks, the acting comptroller, said: “I will not comment on decisions and actions that preceded me, but under my leadership the OCC will use all our tools as warranted to ensure everyone has fair access to banking services and receives fair treatment from the banks and savings associations the OCC oversees.”
Each of the banks declined to comment on the specifics of the investigations and said they are committed to providing equal access to credit.
The lawmakers’ letter is addressed to Brooks, a former bank executive, and asks for details about how the agency has handled discrimination cases under Trump and whether banks have sway over examiners.
The lawmakers ask the regulators to tell them how many times senior OCC officials met with banks that were under investigation for fair lending violations and whether the banks’ lawyers and officers asked senior OCC officials to intervene in the investigations.
Pulling back on enforcement not only weakens protections against discrimination but the power of the Community Reinvestment Act, which grades banks on how well they lend to poor communities, the letter says.
If banks that discriminate are never sanctioned, they could get a higher CRA grade than they deserve, the letter adds: “Disregard for fair lending enforcement could inflate CRA evaluations.”
Otting spent his two and a half years in office rewriting the rules for the CRA, and he stepped down the day after he unveiled a reform plan that gives banks more flexibility in satisfying the law.
Discrimination in mortgage lending was banned more than 50 years ago under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, yet the homeownership rate for Black Americans is 44% compared with 74% for white Americans, according to the most recent census data.

The coronavirus pandemic has proven to be an anchor on the president’s political fortunes, and his failures may drag down Mitch McConnell’s Senate majority and increase the Democrats’ House majority, according to political scientist Daniel Drezner’s new column for the Washington Post.
“Let’s assume this outcome for a second — what does it mean for the GOP?” wrote Drezner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. “Politics is a coldblooded game, and even before Trump has been declared a political dead man walking, speculation is beginning about what comes after.”
Some Republicans have already jumped ship and become #NeverTrumpers, but Drezner is doubtful that the GOP will engage in deep self-reflection about the conditions that led to that downfall.
“Even if Trump crashes and burns, his cult of personality will command significant loyalty from his #MAGA base,” Drezner wrote. “That alone is enough to influence party primaries that in turn influence the party’s future leaders.”
Right-wing conspiracy theorist and anti-immigrant bigot Allen West was elected this week to lead the Texas GOP, and Drezner sees that as a sign that a post-Trump Republican Party could move even further to the fringes.
“The scary thing about a post-Trump GOP is the prospect that it learns nothing,” Drezner wrote. “After getting pasted in 2006 and 2008, the GOP adopted an obstructionist posture during the Obama years. The more disaffected voters were during the Great Recession, the better this strategy worked. It is all too conceivable that the post-Trump GOP changes itself not at all. It can count on the vagaries of partisan politics in the United States to eventually inherit political power once again.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Eleanor Holmes Norton announced Monday they are introducing a bill this week requiring federal law enforcement officials to wear identification when on duty or serving the public.
The United States of America should not have secret police.
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 20, 2020
Federal agents are expected to head to cities around the country over the next few weeks—a deployment that would follow at least a week of operations in Portland, Oregon as part of what is widely seen as a rollout for a more intense and nationwide effort.
BREAKING: @AOC and @EleanorNorton to introduce bill that would require federal law enforcement officers to display identification when on duty, staffers tell me https://t.co/q4W1g0k5P5
— Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) July 20, 2020
Ocasio-Cortez and Norton—the congresswoman for the District of Columbia—are expected to introduce the bill (pdf) later in the week.
As The Nation‘s Ken Klippenstein, who broke the news of the bill, reported:
The bill would require on-duty federal agents to display not just the name of their agency but also the individual agent’s last name and identification number. It would also mandate a new form of oversight for the Justice Department, requiring its inspector general to conduct routine audits to ensure compliance with the legislation. The results of these audits would then be reported to Congress.
“It’s absolute insanity that this isn’t a basic requirement already,” tweeted journalist Adrian Crawford.
Government Accountability Project deputy director of legislation Irvin McCullough told Klippenstein that the lack of accountability is raising concerns as officers from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agencies are increasingly involved in domestic law enforcement.
“Lots of lawyers are asking the same thing: Where’s the transparency?” said McCullough. “Unidentified internal security forces are apprehending American citizens, and accounts allege these apprehension processes are more similar to overseas renditions than traditional arrests.”
“Citizens deserve to know who’s arresting them—or at least what entity—to report any abuses they suffer or witness,” McCullough added.
On Monday, acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf told Fox News that he was not going to be constrained by local officials who do not want his agents in their cities, as happened in Portland.
“I don’t need invitations by the state, state mayors, or state governors to do our job,” said Wolf. “We’re going to do that, whether they like us there or not.”
In June, demonstrators in Washington were cleared from a park near the White House by federal law enforcement officers so President Donald Trump could have a photo op at nearby St. John’s Church.
“Secret police snatching Americans off of street corners and shooting rubber bullets at peaceful demonstrators is something we would expect to see in an authoritarian state, not outside the White House,” Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. “Yet, that is our current reality.”
“This bill will increase accountability and oversight for law enforcement,” she continued. “Currently, law enforcement can violate an American’s First Amendment right with complete anonymity. If an officer violates their agency’s policies, their victim should have the ability to report them to their agency and demand accountability.”

Attorney Max Kennerly welcomed the Ocasio-Cortez/Norton bill.
“We do not need nor want anonymous people asserting they have government authorization to use violence, and we do not need nor want a government that evades accountability by acting through anonymous agents,” tweeted Kennerly.

0,2020-07-21T11:18:11+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/confirmed-fox-news-knew-of-harassment-allegations-against-tucker-carlson-before-his-pre-planned-vacation/,Confirmed: Fox News knew of harassment allegations against Tucker Carlson before his pre-planned vacation,"Fox News learned the details of sexual harassment allegations against top network host Tucker Carlson on July 9, four days before Carlson announced on the air that he would be taking a “long-planned” vacation, Salon has confirmed.
Carlson, who claims to have gone into journalism after a career in the CIA failed to pan out, was named in a sweeping and graphic sexual misconduct lawsuit which two women filed against the network Monday in a New York federal court.
The women, Jennifer Eckhart and Cathy Areu, alleged rape and sexual harassment at the hands of some of Fox News’ biggest stars, including the recently fired Ed Henry and Carlson’s primetime colleague Sean Hannity. Areu singled Carlson out for allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation.
Michael J. Willemin, an attorney who along with veteran sexual misconduct litigator Doug Wigdor represents the two women, told Salon that their team informed the network about the details surrounding Areu’s allegations July 9, which a Fox News spokesperson confirmed to Salon in an email.
The spokesperson said the network “promptly investigated” the claims upon learning about them.
“Tucker is still employed, and this has zero to do with his vacation, which was legit and pre-planned,” the spokesperson added.
Carlson made the announcement on his first show after the network was informed of the pending lawsuit. At the same time, Willemin claimed that the network had already known for two weeks that he and Wigdor were representing the women.
The news raises more questions about the timing of Carlson’s short break, which also came amid an onslaught of criticism after network rival CNN revealed that the show’s longtime top writer had secretly posted racist and vile comments on the internet for years.
Carlson, who once took a vacation when advertisers began cutting ties with his show after he called white supremacy a “hoax,” had in the prior days and weeks escalated his own race-baiting rhetoric again. He was accused of “hate speech” after appearing to echo the infamous white supremacist “14 words” slogan: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”
Following the host’s original July 13 announcement, Salon took up an intrepid investigation into other Fox News personalities who have taken conspicuously timed “vacations” over the years.
Carlson has, in some senses, been riding high after returning in the highest cable news ratings in history the previous month and drawing speculation about a possible presidential run. At the same time, he was the subject of a recent IRS criminal complaint, as well as an ongoing high-profile defamation lawsuit, also filed against the network in a New York federal court.
The latest suit did not deter Carlson from returning to the air Monday. In his first show since the pre-planned interregnum, Carlson attacked The New York Times for allegedly preparing to publish a story which would reveal the location of his house. Carlson suggested that the move would endanger the lives of his wife and children.
The harassment allegations against Carlson stem from a December 2018 installment of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” featuring Cathy Areu, then a frequent guest of the program.
At the end of Areu’s segment, an unnamed producer or writer whispered in her ear to stay put until the program was off air, according to the complaint. She claimed that no one in the crew would disconnect her microphone and earpiece on set, making it impossible for her to leave.
When the show wrapped, Carlson allegedly invited Areu to his hotel room, specifying that his wife would not be present. Areu claimed that Carlson cut her appearances when she refused, featuring her three times in 2019 and zero times in 2020.
A producer said the Fox News host personally reviewed and rejected proposals to have Areu on his show despite the fact that her segments were among the most popular, per the filing.
The suit’s most graphic allegations come from Eckhart, a former associate producer at Fox Business, who accused Henry, the former co-anchor of “America’s Newsroom,” of rape and other forms of sexual violence. Areu also filed sexual harassment claims against Henry, as well as Hannity and the “Media Buzz” host Howard Kurtz. The four men have also been sued in their individual capacities.
The legal complaint was itself so graphic in nature that it included a trigger warning: “This document contains contains highly-graphic information of a sexual nature, including sexual assault.” It goes on to detail Henry’s alleged attempts to groom Eckhart, who claims she was asked to be his “little whore” and “sex slave.” Henry allegedly threatened Eckhart with punishment and retaliation if she did not comply with his demands.
Eckhart alleged that she was ultimately “violently raped while helpless and restrained in metal handcuffs” as Henry “performed sadistic acts on her without her consent that left her injured, bruised and battered with bloody wrists.”
The suit claimed that Henry had earlier forced Eckhart to perform oral sex on him — on network property — before raping her at a hotel where Fox often hosted visiting employees, “thereby facilitating, whether knowingly or unknowingly, Mr. Henry’s conduct.”
Henry also allegedly sent both Eckhart and Areu lewd and abusive text messages. A message to Eckhart referenced “owned & submissive” anal sex, according to the filing. Others said, “F**k you and your safe word. You will know when I am done,” and “When u r owned u don’t get a ‘choice.'”
Yet another text to Eckhart allegedly read, “Good long session last time left you bruised battered dazed sated begging for more.” He appended the tweet with the hashtag “#perfect.”
Henry allegedly abused Areu with “a slew of wildly inappropriate sexual images and messages” for several months this year, according to the court document. The texts, which Areu allegedly retains, include “a ‘closeup’ photograph of a woman’s vagina being ‘clamped’ closed by four clothespins” and a video titled “Fastest Interview … candidate selected in 3 seconds.”
According to the complaint, the video featured a woman job candidate exposing her vagina to the interviewer, who then selected her for the job. Immediately after Henry sent the video, he allegedly texted Areu: “Are you avail for anchor interview.”
Network executives allegedly knew about Henry’s misconduct as far back as early 2017. The suit named Fox News Executive Vice President of Human Resources Kevin Lord, Fox News President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace and Fox Business President Lauren Petterson.
The filing alleged that the network did not take substantive disciplinary action against Henry, but instead rewarded him with a promotion to co-anchor on “America’s Newsroom,” as well as a streaming show on Fox Nation. Additionally, the suit claimed that HarperCollins, a Fox-affiliated imprint, signed Henry to a lucrative book deal.
When Fox News took action against Henry ahead of the lawsuit, the network allegedly did not inform Eckhart, leaving her to learn the news on Twitter and in press reports, according to the filing.
“It’s heinous to do that to a victim like this — to force her to see him all over the news,” Willemin told Salon.
Fox News issued a statement Monday denying Areu’s allegations against anyone other than Henry, based on “the findings of a comprehensive independent investigation.” The statement also suggested that Eckhart and Areu lack standing to sue the network for Henry’s behavior.
“We expect Fox News to claim – as it almost always does – that an ‘independent’ investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing,” said Wigdor, who in 2018 settled claims brought by more than 20 individuals against the network, including allegations against disgraced former star anchor Bill O’Reilly and former CEO Roger Ailes.
Wigdor said that the network’s investigation did not include interviews with either woman, who both offered to meet under “reasonable conditions.” He called on Fox to interview them in the name of public transparency.
“Fox News would have the public believe that it is a different place from the Fox News that was run by former disgraced Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes,” the complaint’s first paragraph read. “Unfortunately, it is actually worse.”
In the spring of 2018, just before former network host Shep Smith departed on his own vacation amid a squabble with the network’s primetime lineup, he told colleague Chris Wallace during on-air banter that everything would be “peachy-keen” on his return.
“Going to take a one-week vacation that was previously planned, and be back in a week, and everything will be peachy-keen and hunky-dory,” Smith said. “I can’t wait.”
“That’s what they always say: Previously planned and one-week vacation,” Wallace replied.
Smith eventually departed the network in 2019 after a public dust-up with Carlson. The network sided with Carlson.

In the leaked intelligence bulletin published in May under the title “Threat Actors Likely Use Private Investment Funds To Launder Money, Circumventing Regulatory Tripwires,” the FBI wrote that it has “high confidence” that “threat actors” could use “the private placement of funds, including investments offered by hedge funds and private equity firms, to launder money, circumventing traditional anti-money laundering programs.” The term “threat actors” refers to both hostile foreign powers and criminals attempting to make money.
The FBI notes that government law enforcement and watchdog agencies aren’t up to the task to suss out money laundering through the finance system in this way. “AML [anti-money laundering] programs are not adequately designed to monitor and detect threat actors’ use of private investment funds to launder money,” the report notes.
A hedge fund is a type of investment fund in which the managers trade in relatively liquid assets (or assets that can be bought and sold without a drastic change in their price) using various complicated techniques. Hedge fund management tends to be lucrative, regardless of whether an individual manager is actually successful, because the standard fee arrangement in the hedge fund industry is something known as “2 and 20.” Under that system, hedge fund managers take two percent of the money put up by an individual wealthy client, regardless of whether they successfully turn a profit off of those investments. When the investments are profitable, they then reap an additional 20 percent of those profits.
Private equities are another type of investment fund. Whereas hedge funds trade in relatively liquid assets, however, private equities purchase and restructure companies which are not being publicly traded through methods such as leveraged buyouts, mezzanine capital, growth capital, venture capital and distressed investments. Private equities are controversial because they often inflate fees and expenses charged to companies in which they hold stakes, which means private equities can hurt individuals whose pension plans are invested in them or whose jobs depend on them through fee arrangements that allow the managers to make billions at the investees’ expense.
Hedge funds and private equity firms operate in a regulatory gray area, which makes them vulnerable to criminality, the FBI claimed: “Hedge funds and private equity firms receive funds from entities registered in nations that maintain laws conducive to masking underlying beneficial owners, thereby making it harder for US financial institutions and regulators to determine the source of funding.”
The report added that “hedge funds and private equity firms have been used to facilitate transactions in support of fraud, transnational organized crime, and sanctions evasion.” It cited as specific alleged examples a former partner at a major American law firm who “assisted others in laundering more than $400 million from a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment scheme,” a representative from a hedge fund based in London and New York who “proposed investing in private placement funds and using a series of shell corporations to purchase and sell prohibited items from sanctioned countries to the United States,” a Mexican cartel operating in southern California which “recruited and paid individuals to open hedge fund accounts at private banking institutions” and “a New York-based private equity firm [which] received more than $100 million in wire transfers from an identified Russia-based company allegedly associated with Russian organized crime.”
Hedge funds and private equities have been associated with a wide range of criminal behavior. Bernie Madoff, who was responsible for a $64.8 billion financial fraud that was exposed in 2008, ran a scam that involved feeder funds, which sends money to hedge funds that make investment decisions. Hedge funds have been previously criticized for not being required to fight money laundering. As Clark Gascoigne, deputy director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, told ProPublica last year: “You’ve got several trillion dollars, the management of which nobody is required to ask any questions about where that money is coming from. This is very problematic.”
There are also occasions when hedge funds profit from a company’s failure: Empty creditors, or people who can be made whole through or even profit from credit default swaps, frequently have a financial incentive to let companies like the global tour operator Thomas Cook crash and burn, rather than try to save them.
Private equities are also rife with controversy. Last month President Donald Trump’s administration allowed large managers of 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) to put workers’ retirement savings into private equity investments. Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), warned that American workers have “socked away $6.2 trillion in 401(k) accounts and another $2.5 trillion in IRA accounts,” meaning that “if just 5 percent of the money in these retirement funds were available to private equity, it would be a windfall of $435 billion — real money even to private equity millionaires and billionaires.” Private equity firms have also been connected with the downfall of companies like Toys R’ Us, RadioShack, Deadspin, Shopko and Payless Shoes.

Politico reported Monday that the sheriff of Jacksonville, Florida is in a particularly difficult spot as the convention day approaches. He explained that the “lack of clear plans, adequate funding and enough law enforcement officers” means he can no longer provide security for the event.
“As we’re talking today, we are still not close to having some kind of plan that we can work with that makes me comfortable that we’re going to keep that event and the community safe,” said Duval County Sheriff Mike Williams. “It’s not my event to plan, but I can just tell you that what has been proposed in my opinion is not achievable right now … from a law enforcement standpoint, from a security standpoint.”
President Donald Trump has demanded an in-person convention, and when North Carolina’s governor refused to allow it, the president sought out his friend Gov. Ron DeSantis, who welcomed them with open COVID-19 arms.
“The controversy deals one of the biggest potential blows to Trump’s decision to hold an in-person nominating convention during a pandemic,” Politico reported. “The proposal has already been beset by concerns over safety and reports of high-profile Republicans declining to attend.”
Sheriff Williams is a Republican, but he places public safety first and he isn’t willing to have his name on the security for an event that can’t be secured. He explained that announcing the major event has given him and his team little time to prepare. So far, the RNC hasn’t found where the convention event will be held other than the convention floor itself. There was supposed to be a $50 million grant, but that was cut back to $33 million and Williams said that there are a lot of strings attached, which makes it difficult for him to agree to security contracts.
By Feb. 2019, the RNC was outed still bankrolling Trump’s former bodyguard, Keith Schiller, saying that he was coordinating the security for the convention. It’s unclear how the $225,000 sum has helped the GOP manage their security problems when Sheriff Williams seems to be the one coordinating the security.
The Florida Sheriffs Association asked the state for 2,000 officers to help with the convention, but they were only able to get about 500. He turned to the Florida Police Chiefs Association, but he still can’t get the numbers necessary to secure the area.
“But there’s a lot of things that need to happen: an event schedule nailed down, and being able to sign contracts and spend money so that we can prepare for this event. And none of that has happened yet,” Williams said. “So here we are inside of 40 days, and I haven’t really pulled the trigger on anything RNC-related when it comes to finances or contracts and so, you know, only related to security, mind you, nothing, nothing related to any of this.”
“It’s like a gunfight. I don’t think we should have gunfights. But if you have one, I’m coming,” said Martin County Sheriff Bill Snyder. “It will be a noxious brew of vitriol and emotion.”
Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told Politico that “Trump’s security detail already makes such big demands of local law enforcement that it makes it difficult to supply security for him.” He explained that he saw what that was like firsthand when Trump visited Daytona Beach recently.
One of the biggest concerns for municipalities has been that Trump’s campaign has refused to pay for additional security costs since the 2016 campaign.
In Oct. 2019, Albuquerque sent a $211,175.94 invoice to the president’s campaign for the security and barricades needed for a rally he did in the city. As of April, the campaign still hadn’t paid the bill. There isn’t much hope, however, as Trump’s campaign has also ignored bills from Lebanon, Ohio, Mesa, Arizona and Erie, Pennsylvania, to name a few.
The Center for Public Integrity reported last year that Green Bay and Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Tucson, Arizona; Burlington, Vermont and Spokane, Washington — were also stiffed by Trump, but that was from before he was elected to the presidency and during the 2016 campaign.
As Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold pointed out, Trump also had Irish police protect him at his resort in Ireland. He charged them $100,000 in food and drink costs.
Sheriff Chitwood confessed that he’s scared not to go along with Trump’s demands.
“There’s a fear of telling him no because anyone who tells the president no, it’s like, off with their heads,” he told Politico.
“There are going to be tons of issues,” he added. “This has something that has never ever happened before. And for some reason, commonsense is being thrown out the window.”

0,2020-07-21T11:10:05+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-most-promising-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-shows-even-more-positive-results/,The most promising coronavirus vaccine candidate shows even more positive results,"Anew study reveals that a promising coronavirus vaccine being developed by Oxford University researchers is safe and shows promise.
The Oxford vaccine, which goes by the unpronounceable moniker “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222),” is being developed with the assistance of a British-Swedish pharmaceutical company known as AstraZeneca, according to an article recently published in The Lancet. The study involved 1,077 volunteers and in its early-stage human trials was shown to be safe and stimulate a strong immune response. Andrew Pollard, the lead author of the study, said in a statement that the researchers hope “this means the immune system will remember the virus, so that our vaccine will protect people for an extended period.”
He added, “However, we need more research before we can confirm the vaccine effectively protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for how long any protection lasts.”
The authors noted that the most common reported systemic reactions were fatigue and headache, and that other negative side effects included feverishness, muscle ache and malaise.
“Our preliminary findings show that the candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine given as a single dose was safe and tolerated, despite a higher reactogenicity profile than the control vaccine, MenACWY,” the authors wrote. Reactogenicity means the tendency of a shot to produce common adverse reactions, like a sore arm or mild fever. “No serious adverse reactions to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 occurred,” they add. “The majority of adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity, and all were self-limiting.”
The World Health Organization reports that there are currently 23 potential vaccines being tested in human trials, with more than 130 others in preclinical studies. In addition to the Oxford study, The Lancet reported that a Chinese vaccine is also showing modest, positive results.
In an editorial, The Lancet pointed out that there are many additional steps beyond the clinical trials, even if they prove fruitful.
“While vaccine development research continues, questions are already arising on the next steps and challenges, concerning the manufacturing, distribution, and widespread accessibility of a possible vaccine,” the editorial warned. “Some strategies are already being considered: Sandy Douglas at the University of Oxford, for example, is leading the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine manufacturing scale-up project. Working immediately on large-scale production could accelerate the availability of a high-quality and safe vaccine when the right candidate is there.”
In addition, as Oxford University notes on its website, “‘Translational medicine’ – taking discoveries from the laboratory right through to treatments for patients — is a significant focus of medical research at Oxford. This ‘bench to bedside’ approach is aided by fruitful links with NHS [National Health Service] organisations.”
One possible threat to the success of any vaccine, at least in the United States, is that a large number of people may not get it and thereby threaten our ability to develop herd immunity. A survey last month by The Washington Post and ABC News found that only 43 percent of Americans would definitely get vaccinated and only 28 percent would probably do so. By contrast, 12 percent said they probably would not and 15 percent said they definitely would not.
“We very clearly know that, if we don’t get 70-something percent of the population covered, we will probably not get to herd immunity,” Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told Salon in May when discussing the struggle to achieve herd immunity. “There are some people that think that, with this virus, we might be able to achieve it with 50 percent, so that’s not 100 percent. But I’m thinking that 70-something percent is about where we need to be, and it’s because I’ve looked at some of the data. We may achieve it with 50 percent, but the bottom line is we’d run the risk of not getting herd immunity with the vaccine.”

0,2020-07-21T11:07:17+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/covid-19-sweeps-through-florida-mega-retirement-villages-community-as-residents-ignore-precautions/,COVID-19 sweeps through Florida mega-retirement Villages community — as residents ignore precautions,"The Villages is a sprawling “age 55-plus” community in central Florida, home to approximately 120,000 well-to do Floridians, mostly retirees. Boasting “an amazing selection of recreation facilities and parks” as well as “many social clubs and activities,” the community is so large it resembles a small city, encompassing three zip codes.
According to Kimiko de Freytas Tamura, writing for the New York Times, residents of the Villages had, for the last four months, basically lived without paying a great deal of attention to the Covid-19 pandemic that has ravaged other areas of the state. Two-thirds of those claiming residence are registered Republicans (some of the more politically active folks within the community were recently celebrated by Donald Trump when he retweeted a golf cart procession commemorating Trump’s birthday, notably highlighted by one Villages resident shouting “White Power!”). In fact, the political affiliations of Villages residents seem to be among the easiest to discern anywhere in the country. As the leader of the Villages Democratic Club, quoted in the Times article, explains, “You can tell who is a Democrat, who is a Republican by their masks.”
The relative insularity of the community and its physical distance from areas of serious Covid-19 outbreaks within the state had apparently, up until this point, prevented significant increases in Covid-19 infections during the first four months of the pandemic. Those halcyon days, however, appear to be ending, and for a hugely vulnerable population, the mounting number of cases within the Villages since the beginning of July has been alarming.
As the Times reports:
Since the beginning of July, hospital admissions of residents from the Villages have quadrupled at University of Florida Health The Villages, the hospital’s critical care doctors said. As of last week, the hospital admitted 29 Villages residents, all of them with the virus, said Dr. Anil Gogineni, a pulmonologist and critical care doctor there. That was up from the single digits three weeks before.
In Sumter County, the biggest of three counties where most of the Villages is concentrated, the number of cases ballooned from 68 in the first week of June to more than 270 last week, according to the county’s health department.
Still, the reality of what is almost certainly about to crash down on them still seems to be eluding most residents. As the Times article notes (and the photos accompanying the article make clear), the areas’ golf courses remain open and filled to capacity, as do the hair salons, bars, restaurants and picnicking areas, by people not wearing any types of masks. Described are loud laughterand ‘line dancing” classes as these senior citizens congregate, seemingly unmoved by the SARS-Cov-2 virus literally encroaching on their doorstep:
They turn up the volume on a radio and dance in the squares. They crowd bars where songs by Elvis Presley and Bobby Sherman play. There are picnics and water aerobics classes.
Virus numbers from the towns just outside the confines of the Villages are even higher. It’s certainly possible that these are attributable to those “essential workers” who service the Villages residents in those same bars, restaurants and golf courses.
Some of the attitudes displayed by the Village residents (as documented in the Times article) are rather telling. Upon being infected, some residents are described as becoming secretive and hiding the fact, as if they had some form of leprosy. As one resident interviewed for the article put it, “It’s like the plague and they don’t want to let anybody else know that they’re sick.” Importantly, residents say they have received no instructions to inform the property managers if they become sick, which suggests that no effort is being made to determine their contacts.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis visited the Villages on July 6, at that time heaping praise on residents for adhering to safety precautions. According to the Villages’ own news outlet, DeSantis “said he had been told by Villages officials about how well residents are doing with social distancing and other precautionary measures.”
But, as the Village-news.com site points out,
DeSantis’ comments would indicate that he isn’t aware of large groups that have been seen gathering at some area restaurant bars, private parties and throughout various other locations in the community. Line dancers often can be found congregating together in the Lake Sumter Landing area and thousands of people packed into the same town square recently for two separate golf cart parades – the majority of whom weren’t wearing masks nor practicing social distancing.
  DeSantis apparently also wasn’t aware of Sumter County sheriff’s deputies having to patrol Lake Sumter Landing early on during the pandemic to break up gatherings on the covered patios, which eventually had to roped off to keep Villagers away from them.
In fact the Village-news article includes a cornucopia of instances involving Villagers ignoring social distancing. It’s not clear whether DeSantis was being unduly credulous to what he “heard” from Village management or whether he was simply inventing some pleasant facts.
Whatever the case, it appears that the Covid-19 pandemic is poised to wreak havoc among some of Florida’s wealthiest senior citizens, many of whom, predominantly Republicans, still appear to be in a complete state of denial. As Tamura notes in her article for the Times, “About 20 percent of Florida’s population is 65 or older, the highest percentage in the nation alongside Maine, and that age group has made up half of its coronavirus hospitalizations and over 80 percent of deaths.”
Note: For a countervailing viewpoint regarding the Times’ portrayal, please see this from blueash in the comments.

Sign up for The ProPublica Illinois newsletter for weekly updates.
A Michigan family court judge on Monday denied a motion to release a teenager who has been held at a juvenile facility since mid-May for violating probation after not doing her online schoolwork, saying the girl will benefit from ongoing treatment there.
“I think you are exactly where you are supposed to be,” the presiding judge of the Oakland County Family Court Division, Mary Ellen Brennan, told the 15-year-old. “You are blooming there, but there is more work to be done.”
The decision came despite an argument from the attorneys of the teenager, Grace*, that the therapy and educational support she receives at the facility are inadequate and a statement by the prosecutor that his office supported her release. Caseworkers for the court and Children’s Village, where she is being held, testified she should be kept at the facility until she completes the monthslong program.
After the hearing, Grace and her mother, Charisse, embraced for more than a minute, the first time they have had physical contact since May 14 because of COVID-19 restrictions. They sobbed audibly through their masks before leaving the courtroom separately.
During the two-hour hearing at the Oakland County court, Brennan also mounted a defense of her initial decision in May to place Grace in detention for the probation violation, devoting about 45 minutes to recounting the troubled relationship between the girl and her mother.
Brennan began by speaking directly to the girl, saying she wanted to ensure the information was on the record: “This morning for you, respectfully, it is going to get worse before it gets better. Because I am about to go over all the crap, all the negative, all the prior attempts at helping. I am going through it all.”
The case, which has drawn national scrutiny, was detailed in a ProPublica Illinois investigation co-published last week with the Detroit Free Press and Bridge Magazine. It has sparked several protests outside the courthouse, and members of Congress, state lawmakers and Birmingham Public Schools board members have called for Grace’s release. The Michigan Supreme Court’s oversight agency has opened a review of the procedures in the cases.
Monday’s hearing came after Grace’s new attorney, Jonathan Biernat, filed a motion Thursday asking the court to review the case and send her home.
Brennan limited discussion to Grace’s “progress and engagement” in the treatment program. She denied Grace’s attorneys’ attempts to discuss her original decision to detain the teenager for the probation violation and would not allow testimony from Grace’s special education teacher.
The prosecutor’s office has until Friday to respond to Biernat’s motion to reconsider the ruling on the probation violation, and Brennan said she will then issue a written opinion.
Grace was a high school sophomore in Birmingham Public Schools when she was charged with assault and theft last year, for incidents in which she bit her mother’s finger and pulled her hair and stole another student’s cellphone.
She was placed on probation in mid-April and, among other requirements, was to complete her schoolwork. Grace, who has ADHD and receives special education services, struggled with the transition to online learning and fell behind when Groves High School stopped in-person learning because of COVID-19. Her probation officer filed a violation against her on May 5, two weeks into the probation.
On May 14, Brennan found Grace guilty of violating probation for “failure to submit any schoolwork and getting up for school.” She ordered her detained, concluding Grace was a “threat to (the) community” based on the prior charges of assault and theft. Grace was placed in secure detention at Children’s Village, in suburban Detroit, for about three weeks and then transferred to a residential treatment program within the facility.
The decision to detain Grace came while the state was operating under an order from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to eliminate any form of detention or residential placement unless a young person posed a “substantial and immediate safety risk to others.”
At Monday’s hearing, Grace’s case coordinator at Children’s Village and the judge, reading from the caseworker’s report, said the girl has behaved well and has been engaged with the treatment program. She has met all the goals, was the “star resident” one week this month and is currently at the second of five stages in the program. Each stage takes about a month to complete, the case coordinator said, and she recommended that Grace complete the program. That would take another three and a half months, she said.
The court caseworker also recommended that Grace stay in the program. “They have made significant progress,” the caseworker, Ashley Bishop, said. “In speaking with mom, she reports they have been able to communicate much better, (Grace) is more self-aware, she is more serious, she is more thoughtful.”
“When I read this report, this is as good as it gets. … This is excellent. She is on point, she is doing well, she is engaged,” Brennan said. She later said, “The worst thing I can do is say you are doing great, now let’s get you home and watch the whole thing blow up.”
But Grace, speaking to the judge, said her good behavior indicated she was ready to go home. “I know I can control myself. … That altercation should not be defining who I should be now,” she said, adding: “I can be respectful. I can be obedient. I feel like that is being completely disregarded, no offense.”
She and her attorney argued she has been “deprived” of education and therapy. She has between 30 and 60 minutes of individual therapy twice a month and has had three joint sessions with her mother. Before being detained, she was meeting with a therapist twice weekly in addition to family therapy and academic tutoring, Grace and her mother have said.
“I believe placement in my home with the same, consistent therapy that I was getting beforehand, and love and support that will always be around me, will be a benefit for myself, my mom, my family and my community,” Grace said.
For school, Grace has been provided packets of material from the local district, which she said have been inadequate. “I am getting behind in my actual schooling while here. The schooling here is beneath my level of education,” she said. “And I know you may not seem to think this is a punishment, but in my heart, I feel the aching and the loss as if it were a punishment.”
For the first segment of the hearing, Brennan detailed Grace’s contentious relationship with her mother, during what she referred to as “the crazy years,” citing police records and child welfare reports mostly from 2017 and 2018. The reports describe Grace yelling, pushing, punching and biting her mother, and her mother’s inability to control her daughter, the judge said. She also mentioned Grace’s mental health treatment and troubles at school, including her theft of school technology, as well as social services support to help resolve conflicts between the mother and daughter.
The ProPublica investigation cited the police reports and other records about Grace’s behavior, including that she entered a court diversion program in 2018, at her mother’s request, for “incorrigibility.” At that time, Grace agreed to participate in counseling and not use electronic devices.
However, in filing the probation violation, the probation officer, who did not appear in court Monday, only cited incomplete schoolwork. She said Charisse reported that her daughter was not doing work, though the mother has said she spoke out of frustration. Charisse subsequently has said her daughter needed time to adjust to remote learning.
Brennan, who is running for reelection, said on Monday she had not felt it was safe to send Grace home after the probation violation because of the “numerous incidents of domestic violence,” and she didn’t want to put them in a “hot box” together when families generally were staying at home during the pandemic.
“She was not detained because she didn’t turn her homework in,” Brennan said at one point during the hearing, taking a long pause to look out at the courtroom. “She was detained because I found her to be a threat of harm to her mother based on everything I knew.”
At the original probation violation hearing in May, Grace’s mother testified that her daughter had not caused her any physical harm during the probation period. Grace said at Monday’s hearing that there had been no physical altercations between the two after the original assault charge in November and there is no police record of any.
In issuing the decision, Brennan said she wanted the girl to succeed, urging her to “give yourself a chance to follow through and finish something.”
She also cited the teenager’s work with a program at Children’s Village to prepare shelter dogs for adoption. “I want you to finish. The dogs want you to finish. Truly,” she said.
Biernat, Grace’s attorney, said after the hearing that he plans to appeal the decision. “We want her back at home with her mother,” he said.
As Grace and her mother hugged before saying goodbye, Charisse told her to “stay strong.”
With her head on her mother’s shoulder, Grace replied: “I can’t.”
ProPublica is using middle names for the teenager and her mother to protect their identities.

Trump confirmed reports about his push to include a payroll tax holiday in an interview with Fox News that first aired on Sunday.
“I would consider not signing it if we don’t have a payroll tax cut,” Trump said, claiming that “a lot of Republicans like it.”
“It’s been proven to be successful and it’s a big saving for the people. It’s a tremendous saving and an incentive for companies to hire their workers back and to keep their workers,” Trump later said during a Monday appearance in the Oval Office. “The payroll tax to me is very important.”
Though a few Republicans, such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have expressed support for a payroll tax cut, a “number of Republicans oppose” the measure and have pushed back on its inclusion in the bill, according to The Washington Post.
“I have not talked to a single office that has expressed enthusiasm for payroll tax cut,” Brian Riedl, a tax expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute, told The Post.
The payroll tax is a 7.65% tax on employee earnings and a 7.65% tax on employers that funds the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. While President Barack Obama temporarily cut the tax by 2% for workers in 2011, Trump wants a full temporary pause on the tax for both workers and employers, according to The Wall Street Journal.
“Trump’s actions are a war on seniors,” Nancy Altman, the head of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CNBC. “He is insisting on threatening Social Security on which most seniors rely for their food, medicine and other basic necessities.”
Republicans, who have raised objections over the rising federal deficit, are expected to include the proposal in their bill, according to The Post. A March estimate from the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that eliminating the tax for eight months would increase the deficit by $840 billion.
Because the proposal is targeted at those still receiving paychecks, it would do nothing for the tens of millions of Americans laid off amid the pandemic.
“A payroll tax cut is exceptionally ill-suited for the current moment,” Seth Hanlon, a tax expert at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told Business Insider. “It’s not a second best solution. It’s not even the hundredth best solution. It’s a policy that’s designed to benefit people who are working. It benefits people who are earning more, and it doesn’t do anything for people out of work.”
The policy would largely benefit the richest Americans while providing most American workers with negligible benefits. An analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that 65% of the benefits would flow to the richest 20% of Americans. For most Americans, the “benefits would arrive drip by drip,” according to Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
“That wouldn’t do enough for households affected by the coronavirus, which are likely to need a sizable infusion of cash to meet necessary expenses,” he wrote in a Bloomberg op-ed.
Worse, Republicans plan to add the payroll tax cut to their proposal while pushing for a cut to unemployment benefits for jobless Americans, according to The Post. The Republican plan may also require Americans to pay back the tax cut at a later date.
The legislation could also alter plans to send another round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans. That is expected to be coupled with a reduction to the $600-per-week federal unemployment benefits to $200 or $400 per week.
Republicans are also expected to reject desperate pleas for cities and states facing massive budget shortfalls due to a lack of tax revenue caused by stay-at-home orders. Instead, Republicans plan to offer local leaders flexibility on spending the $150 billion Congress allocated in March. The House had passed a bill which would provide $1 trillion in additional relief to states and cities.
The Republican bill is also expected to tie school funding to classroom reopenings. While the House plan would provide about $3 trillion in relief, the GOP proposal is expected to be valued at around $1 trillion.
“Unfortunately, by all accounts the Senate Republicans are drafting legislation that comes up short in a number of vital areas, such as extending unemployment benefits or funding for rental assistance, hazard premium pay for frontline workers, or investments in communities of color being ravaged by the virus, and many other necessary provisions,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a Monday letter to Democratic colleagues. “Democrats will need to fight hard for these important provisions.”

“Former Florida congressman Allen West unseats James Dickey to become Texas GOP chairman” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
Allen West, the firebrand former Florida congressman, has defeated Texas GOP Chairman James Dickey to lead the country’s largest state Republican Party.
West claimed victory shortly before 3:30 a.m. Monday, while Dickey conceded about an hour later. The developments came during an early morning round of voting among state Senate district caucuses at the party’s virtual convention.
West ended up carrying a clear majority of the 31 caucuses — 22 — to only four for Dickey, a wide enough margin to negate any desire for a floor fight where individual delegates would be asked to make their choice for chair. Dickey formally withdrew early Monday afternoon, urging party unity ahead of the November election.
“That is my commitment and that is my humble request of all of us — that we stand together, united by our shared commitment to win together in November,” Dickey said.
West briefly joined Dickey on the convention broadcast, saying the two are “united in one single message” of keeping Texas a “strong, red conservative state.” West, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, also told Dickey to “please consider yourself to be a very important counselor and mentor to me — because I know how to jump out of airplanes, but I’m gonna learn how to be a pretty good chairman of the Republican Party of Texas.”
West moved to Texas several years ago and became politically active here. His victory means an abrupt change in party leadership with less than four months until one of the most challenging elections that Texas Republicans are facing in a long time.
West’s campaign said Monday morning he would “immediately resume the responsibilities of the role and begin to implement his strategy to hold Texas.” West got encouragement from President Donald Trump, who tweeted, “Congratulations Allen, great job!”
Dickey’s concession early Monday morning came amid reports that West was easily winning the majority of Senate district caucuses. A candidate needs to carry at least three caucuses to force a floor vote, though West’s strong showing left little uncertainty about how that vote would go and Dickey chose not to go to the floor.
The race’s conclusion capped a tumultuous convention that had unraveled on Dickey’s watch. There was so much dysfunction and delay that delegates voted late Sunday night to take up unfinished business at a second convention — after settling party leadership races.
After Dickey dropped out of the chair race Monday afternoon, he passed the convention gavel to West, who promptly adjourned the gathering until the second convention. The time and place of the second convention have not been determined. Those and other details will be recommended by a 10-person committee that delegates voted to establish late Sunday night but has not named yet.
In addition to Dickey, the party’s vice chair, Alma Perez Jackson, was also defeated. She had faced a challenge from Cat Parks, who chairs the Hamilton County party and had led a candidate recruitment task force created by Dickey. Parks declared victory late Monday morning, shortly before it was announced that she had won 16 Senate district caucuses to 11 for Jackson.
West represented Florida’s 22nd Congressional District from 2011-2013. He built a national profile for his bombast, sparring with his House colleagues and railing against then-President Barack Obama. West came to Texas in 2014 to become the CEO of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas think tank that shuttered three years later.
Responding to West’s win Monday morning, the Texas Democratic Party pointed to his long trail of incendiary rhetoric. Among the comments: He has argued Islam is not a religion but a “totalitarian, theocratic political ideology.” West, who is Black, has also suggested Black communities were “stronger” during segregation.
“We’re disgusted but not surprised that Texas Republicans chose a certified racist conservative hardliner like Allen West as their new chairman,” state Democratic Party spokesman Abhi Rahman said in a statement. “West is everything that is wrong with the Republican Party and brings to light their failures on building an inclusive, welcoming party that is deliberate and thoughtful in handling crisis situations.”
Dickey had campaigned on restoring the party’s finances and positioning it well for the November election through a renewed focus on fundraising, candidate recruitment and voter registration. During his closing statement Saturday morning, Dickey also impressed upon delegates how all-consuming the job is, saying “this is a 24/7 job and I have been a 24/7 chairman.”
“Words matter, but work matters too — and results matter more,” Dickey said, repeatedly saying his “No. 1 priority” is to help ensure success for President Trump and Texas Republicans in November. “This is what I’m focused on, folks — winning.”
In his final pitch to delegates, West promised to make the party better known nationally and adopt a more aggressive strategy against what he described as an increasingly extreme Democratic Party.
“It’s time that our Republican Party once again steps up and leads the way, not just in Texas, but all across the United States of America,” West said. “It’s time to make sure that the Republican Party of Texas is relevant again, that our message is out, that our message is being heard.”
West also appealed to some in the party who have grown frustrated with their own leaders — namely Gov. Greg Abbott — for how they have responded to the coronavirus pandemic. West rallied delegates against what he said was the “tyranny that we see in the great state of Texas, where we have executive orders and mandates, people telling us what we can and cannot do, who is essential, who is not essential.”
The State Republican Executive Committee first elected Dickey to the post in 2017 after the resignation of his predecessor Tom Mechler. Dickey won his first full term a year later at the state convention.
Before chairing the state party, Dickey led the GOP in Travis County, home to Austin.
West brought a high profile to the race and huge financial advantage, vastly out raising and outspending Dickey. While West stumped on building a more ambitious Texas GOP, he also courted support from some in the party who believe Dickey had grown too unwilling to stand up to state leaders when it came to the party’s legislative priorities and the scandal last year that forced House Speaker Dennis Bonnen into retirement.
But no issue overshadowed the closing weeks of the race like the party’s insistence on conducting an in-person convention in Houston despite the coronavirus pandemic. After the convention center operator nixed the party’s contract earlier this month, the party launched a legal battle to continue with an in-person convention. The party lost in the courts shortly before the convention was set to begin, leaving it with a short period to transition to a virtual gathering.
Despite promises that the party had a virtual backup plan all along, the convention opened Thursday with almost immediate technical problems, and the State Republican Executive Committee voted that night to pause the event for a day Friday to resolve the issues. When the convention came back Saturday, things were still rocky — delegates complained they had still not received credentials, committees took much longer than scheduled and live-streaming problems ruined speeches by some of the state’s top elected officials.
West largely stayed out of the convention debate until recent days, when he criticized Dickey for not having an adequate backup plan and questioned the voting technology for the virtual gathering. On Saturday afternoon, he joined calls for Dickey to halt the convention until every delegate could be credentialed.
Dickey acknowledged the pre-convention turbulence in his speech Saturday morning.
“This has been a humbling week and this path to our state convention today has been challenging,” he said, “but I will never give up on the Texas Republican Party.”

Then cases exploded,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Back in April, when public health officials were still helping lead Utah’s response to the coronavirus, the spread of the disease had slowed, stabilizing at fewer than 200 reported cases a day.
Then came a shift in power, and priorities.
State legislators who felt Gov. Gary Herbert was not moving quickly enough to lift restrictions on businesses created a commission to set guidelines to reopen. “It’s not meant to give economic outcomes a higher weight, but it is time to give them some weight,” said Sen. Daniel Hemmert, a Republican who sponsored the bill and took his seat on the commission alongside other politicians, bureaucrats and business leaders.
Email correspondence and interviews with more than a dozen state and local officials in Utah show that the health of the state’s businesses was prioritized over the health of the public, as officials stopped slowing the spread of the virus and instead calculated how many sick people its health system could bear.
Dr. Joseph Miner, executive director of the Utah Department of Health, told ProPublica that state leaders originally planned to relax restrictions as cases decreased. But “because of the concern that you can’t keep the economy closed this long,” they reopened before that happened and shifted their attention to how many cases hospitals and contact tracers could handle.
“We know there’s going to be increased cases. We just said, amongst ourselves, this is really what we’re addressing: our capacity to respond rather than decreasing numbers.”
With key health experts cut out of the decision-making process, including the state epidemiologist and local officials who were stripped of their ability to issue their own restrictions, the governor and the commission quickly swept aside restrictions meant to slow the virus’s advance in Utah. You can now hold indoor events with up to 3,000 people and outdoor events with up to 6,000. You can drink at bars, eat in restaurants and go to the movies.
People in Utah are going back to work; new unemployment claims from early July dropped 78% since the peak from early April, when most businesses were closed, and its unemployment rate is just above 5%, which is under half of the national average. Utah was considered one of the states best-prepared to weather the pandemic’s economic downturn. But experts say that rising infections could threaten any state’s recovery.
And in Utah, infections are rising. The percentage of tests that come back positive is at 10% as of July 13, compared with 3% to 5% in April. On July 14, the state reported its highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. Since late May, the seven-day average of daily case counts statewide has quadrupled.
Utah’s story is mirrored in states across the country, where leaders sidelined public health experts and forged ahead without meeting criteria scientists say are necessary to reopen. In Florida, the governor loosened restrictions as cases rose; Miami is now the national epicenter of the virus. Georgia left it up to businesses to decide how much to scale back service in the middle of a pandemic; South Carolina let the hospitality industry write its own reopening guidelines. The virus is now spreading uncontrolled in those two states, with some of the highest rates in the country. Texas, whose governor took advice on reopening from a panel stacked with corporate executives and business leaders, reopened restaurants and malls after reaching a record in daily deaths; its hospitals are now stretched to the brink.
Herbert’s office did not respond to questions about how he’s managed the pandemic. In an emailed statement, Jefferson Burton, the commission’s co-chair, said the group regularly reviews Utah’s reopening guidelines and makes changes based on new data, federal guidance and input from stakeholders. Decisions on when to lift restrictions are based on hospital utilization, infection growth rates and the number of tests performed, among other factors, the statement said. “There are not hard-and-fast data points that automatically trigger a move. … Rather, individual geographic areas are evaluated looking at their specific trends over time.”
Dr. Michael Good, CEO of University of Utah Health and the only physician on the commission, said the “goal has always been to slow the spread of the virus.” The commission is trying to balance decisions on reopening in a way that keeps infections low while not inadvertently causing other social and economic problems, he said.
Epidemiologists say that one of the biggest risks of reopening prematurely is that it suggests formerly banned activities are now safe. The family of a diabetic man who died after going to a party in Riverside County, California, said he had been careful until the government eased restrictions.
The timing of Utah’s spikes in cases clearly overlaps with the loosening of restrictions, said Dr. Emily Spivak, an infectious disease physician at University of Utah Health. People assumed the risk was over. Spivak has seen group barbecues and young people taking party trips to Lake Powell with “full-on 20-year-old summer social behavior.” Of course case numbers went up, she added. “It’s not rocket science.”
A Shift in Power
Initially, Utah acted decisively to try and stop the spread of the coronavirus. In March, working with health advisers, Herbert decided to shut down schools days before New York City and restricted businesses based on their level of risk. Restaurants could not offer dine-in service; gyms and salons were closed.
While Herbert refused to issue a statewide shutdown, saying he didn’t want to overrestrict less affected areas, mayors and local health officials wrote their own stay-at-home orders, which came with fines and even criminal penalties for violations. The state was a patchwork of legally binding rules, as The Salt Lake Tribune reported. “We give local control for the regional differences,” Herbert said at the time, “and I think we’ve struck the right balance.”
Senate President Stuart Adams, a Republican businessman, disagreed. On April 8, he confirmed that lawmakers would convene to address the pandemic and consider limiting the power of local governments, saying their rules were creating confusion. It was time, he told the local paper in Ogden, for “a new phase” focused on the economy.
Sen. Hemmert and Rep. Mike Schultz co-sponsored a bill to establish the Public Health and Economic Emergency Commission, a 10-member team that would guide the reopening and advise Herbert. Staff from the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget would provide support.
Apart from two health care system CEOs, none of the members had a medical or public health background. Among them: Adams, the two Republican legislators who sponsored the bill, the president and CEO of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce and the CEO of the Larry H. Miller Group of Companies, which includes sports teams such as the Utah Jazz as well as a chain of Megaplex Theatres across the state.
By the time the commission assembled, there was a new leader in charge of the state’s coronavirus response.
Miner, a physician who had headed the state Health Department since 2015, has a lung condition and had been unable to attend in-person meetings. To be the “boots on the ground” for the the virus response, the governor appointed Burton, a retired military leader with no medical training who had experience in disaster management. Burton once headed Utah’s National Guard and is running for a seat in the state House of Representatives. While Miner said he has remained “very much involved,” he was not present, even virtually, for key decisions ProPublica asked about. He said he was briefed on outcomes by Burton’s deputy.
During the time that Burton has served as co-chair of the commission, the three legislators on the commission have donated (either personally or through their campaigns) a total of $4,000 toward his run for state office, one-fifth of what his campaign has raised. He won the Republican primary in June and has no Democratic challenger in the general election.
The governor’s office and a large team of advisers had createda color-coded system for reopening that could be turned up or down like a dial “based on the health risk.” The system had four levels that dictated how businesses could operate, labeled red (“high risk”), orange (“moderate risk”), yellow (“low risk”) and green (“new normal risk”). All of Utah was under the red designation in late April; each successive level would open more businesses and ease limitations.
The commission took the governor’s guidelines and added specific rules for every industry, including restaurants, schools, entertainment venues and religious services. Five days after the group was created, it recommended moving the state to orange.
Herbert accepted the plan and moved Utah to the “moderate risk” level on May 1. Hotels and gyms opened. Groups of 20 could congregate with masks and social distancing.
Another Shift in “Risk”
Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say one of the key factors for relaxing restrictions is evidence of a 14-day decline in new cases.
By May 12, cities and counties were expressing an interest in moving into the yellow, “low risk” level. Cases had plateaued, but had not dropped. Dr. Angela Dunn, the state epidemiologist, told KSL News Radio that on an “optimistic” timeline, some parts of the state might be ready to move into yellow on June 1.
But on May 14, just 13 days after moving the state into orange, the governor and the commission announced they were moving most of the state into the “low risk” level, on May 16. It was impossible to see, at that point, the full effects of the orange phase after half a month, because of the incubation period of the virus and the lag between symptoms, testing and test results.
Jenny Wilson, the mayor of Salt Lake County, petitioned to keep her county in orange; she noted that the active positive case rate there was several times higher than the state’s. She could have kept the restrictions before the bill creating the commission passed, but now she needed the governor’s approval. Herbert denied the appeal, but he approved similar petitions from the two largest cities in her county — Salt Lake City and West Valley City — and three other counties.
The rest of the state relaxed further into the phase labeled “low risk.” All businesses could resume with certain precautions. Public swimming pools opened; close-contact team sports were allowed with temperature checks. Restaurants could serve buffets.
“Speaking [with] my public health voice, I feel that this is a mistake,” Jennifer Dailey-Provost, a Democratic state representative who’s pursuing a doctorate in public health, tweeted in reaction. “To say I’m frightened is an understatement. I hope I’m wrong.”
Two weeks later, on May 27, cases began to surge.
A spokesman from the Salt Lake County Health Department said it’s hard to say if the county would have fewer cases today if the entire county (and not just two cities) had stayed in orange. Commuting patterns make it impossible to separate different municipalities, and the piecemeal approach left some streets orange on one side and yellow on the other.
County data shows that throughout June, on days with a particularly high number of new cases, more than half came from areas that went yellow before the mayor felt they were ready.
Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said the commission has made it more cumbersome for local leaders to pass their own rules, but she gives the governor credit for allowing her city to remain in orange and approving the county’s mandate for wearing face masks in public.
One of the counties Herbert had allowed to stay in orange was Grand County, home to Arches National Park. But that changed on May 28. When local officials asked to maintain extra protections as they moved to yellow — such as leaving hotel rooms empty for 24 hours between bookings — the governor’s office denied the request.
The rural county has logged few cases, though it is impossible to tell how many tourists may have caught the virus there before returning home. Bradon Bradford, director of the Southeast Utah Health Department, which covers Grand County, said the local numbers started going up in July.
The commission’s top-down approach is “uncharacteristic” of Utah, said Kirk Benge, who leads the Public Health Department for San Juan County in the southeastern corner of the state. “Most politicians claim that they like local authority and they like local decisions. In an emergency, to immediately strip that … I felt, was a mistake at the time.”
A Mysterious Decision
Top health officials and other legislators have little insight into the commission’s actions. Miner told ProPublica he has never attended a meeting. Nor has Dunn, the state epidemiologist. Both are part of a work group that provides input on what activities are allowed under each phase, but they aren’t involved in the final decisions of when and how restrictions are loosened.
Dailey-Provost, the legislator with public health training, said her offers to help and suggest health experts went nowhere. She co-authored a study in April that predicted how coronavirus cases would peak in Utah. Reality has outstripped the study’s worst projections.
One of the commission’s most significant decisions occurred in late May, when they suggested redefining the yellow phase, which capped gatherings at 50 people, to allow indoor gatherings of 3,000 and outdoor gatherings of 6,000.
The proposal caught Dunn and other health officials off guard. They discussed it at their work group meeting of health and business experts. Burton’s deputy, Richard Saunders, who often attends commission meetings, was also present.
Benge, the health officer for San Juan County, said he was “100% against” the change. Many businesses were still transitioning into the yellow phase and hadn’t had time to open up, Benge said, so it was too early to loosen the guidelines any further. Dunn and Miner shared similar concerns.
Miner said he recalls the group was being asked to figure out how to implement the change as safely as possible. He said they concluded that if the venues were required to track where everyone sat, at least they could do contact tracing if anyone got sick.
The numbers were headed in the wrong direction. A day earlier, on May 28, the Tribune reported the biggest single-day spike in new cases statewide, as well as an outbreak in a nursing facility that infected more than half the residents. One county in northern Utah saw a 33% increase in cases.
Health officers fretted about the decision in emails released to ProPublica.
“This change happened on a timeline contrary to my recommendations and the recommendations of the state epidemiologist and other health officers,” Benge wrote to his county health board.
“I don’t think we’ll need to move to Green because it’s all being phased into Yellow,” Bradford wrote to other local health officials.
“So who is going to count to see when they reach 6001 participants?” another officer replied.
Herbert accepted the commission’s changes in June.
Jordan Mathis, the officer for the TriCounty Health Department that oversees Daggett, Duchesne and Uintah counties, said the numbers seemed arbitrary. “Why 3,000? Why 6,000? Where’d we pull those from?”
Good, the commission member, said he doesn’t recall the exact reasons behind those numbers, but those discussions “were occurring at a time when 999 out of 1,000 Utahns did not have a coronavirus infection,” he said. Today, the situation is more serious, with four times as many active cases as there were back then, he said. “Those are not the conversations we would be having today.”
Brian Hatch, the health officer for Davis County, sits on a medical team that is supposed to advise the commission. He doesn’t recall the commission ever asking for its advice on the phase guidelines. The medical team has focused on recommendations for high-risk residents who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.
Hatch said the idea for 6,000 people outdoors might have come from his county. When the state moved to yellow, there was no reopening plan for Lagoon Amusement Park, the only amusement park in the state. The park owners worked with Hatch. They settled on 6,000 people, which is 15% of its usual capacity. With social distancing, mandated masks and other precautions like timed tickets, they could operate safely, Hatch said.
The park reopened Memorial Day weekend with the governor’s approval, a week before the commission meeting on May 29. A spokesman for the park said it reached the 6,000-person limit only a few times since opening. Hatch said there have been no outbreaks connected to the park, and having a large crowd dispersed outdoors is very different from cramming 3,000 spectators indoors. Since the risk of infection is much higher inside, “I’m concerned with 20 people together,” he said.
Hatch said he doesn’t know where the 3,000 number came from. Health officials couldn’t point to any recent events with thousands gathered indoors. A spokeswoman for the Larry H. Miller Group, whose CEO sits on the commission, said the company’s movie theaters have kept indoor crowds at 50 and have not hosted any sporting events at their large venues.
The indoor guidelines require assigned seating (to enable contact tracing) and masks whenever social distancing isn’t possible.
Dunn and Benge said masks alone aren’t enough. Masks need to be used in concert with distancing and hand washing, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “(The commission is) using the masks as an excuse to break all the other science rules.”
The High Risk of “Low Risk”
Shortly after the May 29 meeting where the work group discussed the changes to the yellow guidelines, the commission held its own meeting.
According to meeting minutes, the commission wanted to determine how and when the state could switch to green, the “new normal.” One of the people present was Burton’s deputy, Saunders, who had just attended the work group meeting with Dunn and Miner.
Saunders told commission members that the potential impact from recent events — including Memorial Day celebrations and the opening of the amusement park — would become clear in the coming week. He said epidemiologists in the state Health Department advised staying at yellow until June 30.
Adams motioned to move most of the state to green by June 5, as long as the data supported it. The transition meant large crowds could gather without assigned seating. Religious services would no longer require 6 feet of space between families and sports competitions could resume.
The six commission members who were present voted unanimously for the idea. They waited several days to announce the news.
Utah had cycled through two phase changes in one month. Dunn worried residents saw it as permission to abandon precautions like masks. After all, the yellow phase was labeled “low risk.”
“I am concerned that we are providing the public with false information regarding their risk for contracting COVID-19,” she wrote to Miner, Burton and others on June 1. “Our % positive is at 7%, just a short jump away from the 8% positive at the beginning of this outbreak when we were only testing hospitalized patients. Our growth rate is sharply increasing.”
The very next day, the commission said the state was ready to go to green.
When Benge heard the news, he told colleagues he was “concerned that the current ‘Phased Health Guidelines’ have gradually shifted at the state level, from being focused on protecting health to being more focused on protecting the economy.”
The commission acknowledged coronavirus cases “may continue to rise” as restrictions are lifted. But case numbers are “a poor indicator of health risk for all Utahns,” as 99% of COVID-19 patients recover, they said in a press release that cited low hospitalization rates, low death rates and increased testing and contact tracing. They called for a “smart” green level where everyone should still wear masks and stay socially distant.
They didn’t mention the racial disparities that persisted throughout the pandemic. Fourteen percent of Utah’s population is Latino, but they make up 40% of cases. The proportion of patients who die from the virus is three times as high for Native Americans as it is for white residents. Navajo Nation, which extends into Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, recently imposed stay-at-home orders over several weekends because of the worsening situation in surrounding areas. Most of the roads leading to Utah’s national parks go through the reservation, said Pete Sands, a spokesman for Utah Navajo Health Systems. So when residents or visitors refuse to take precautions, it directly affects Navajo citizens.
Too many states are letting their cases grow based only on health care capacity, said Benjamin, the American Public Health Association director. “Why open the economy and allow needless death and illness and disability … [when] this single-minded strategy is eroding the economy in the long term?” he said. “Sick people can’t work. People who are afraid to go out and shop [or] eat aren’t going to go out.”
Experts say there’s more at play than ensuring hospital beds; workers face personal protective equipment shortages and burnout. There’s no surefire way to prevent COVID-19 deaths, and many survivors are left with heart damage, scarred lungs, neurological problems and other long-term effects doctors are just beginning to understand.
A day after the commission’s announcement on June 2, Dunn told reporters that no community in Utah was ready for green.
Herbert waited until June 12 before moving one county to green. A week later, he approved requests from nine other counties to do the same.
As Herbert finalized the partial shift to green, Dunn sent an urgent memo to state and local health officials, which the Tribune published several days later on June 22.
“If we do not reach a rolling 7-day average of 200 [cases] per day by July 1, we need to move the entire state to orange,” Dunn wrote. “This will send the message to Utahns that this outbreak continues to be a serious problem.”
“This might be our last chance for course correction,” she warned. “Contact tracing and testing alone will not control this outbreak.”
Dunn recommended a statewide requirement for face masks. If that wasn’t possible, she wrote, “we need to be clear with the public about why decisions are being made lessening restrictions — economic, not health.”
Herbert said he appreciated Dunn’s analysis but would not close down the economy. The seven-day average stood at 485 cases per day.
Beyond Capacity
By mid-July, the seven-day average had reached 650 cases per day.
A growing number of health and business interests want a statewide mask mandate. That includes the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce and the Larry H. Miller Group, whose leaders sit on the commission. Adams has come out against the idea.
Herbert has required masks in state buildings and in K-12 schools starting this fall but stopped short of a blanket rule, citing individual freedom and local control. The issue has become so politicized in Utah that one county commissioner compared the idea of a mask mandate to Nazism. In Provo, residents crowded into a county commission meeting to protest the school mask requirement.
Darin Mellott, a real estate executive who serves on a separate economic task force on the pandemic, describes himself as an establishment Republican. But he personally feels masks are an easy way to stem the tide. “I think future generations, if we do nothing, are going to look back and say, ‘Why did you subject so many people … to this threat, because of some imagined threat to our liberty?’”
Mellott said Herbert has a tough balancing act — “I think we would be in a much worse situation if it weren’t for him” — but that the governor and other state leaders need to give more health professionals a seat at the table. “This is a war against the virus, and the medical professionals are the generals,” he said. “So listen to the generals.”
In a recent press conference, Herbert acknowledged that labeling the different phases based on risk might have given the public a false sense of security. He challenged residents to voluntarily wear masks and set a goal to keep average new cases below 500 a day by August 1. Herbert cited 800 a day as the absolute maximum the state can handle.
Dunn told ProPublica she suggested 200 cases a day because it allows the state to do contact tracing within 24 hours. Because of the lag time between infections and hospitalizations, any preventative measures taken today won’t have an effect for another two to four weeks, so there’s no time to lose. “You can’t wait until you’re already underwater,” she said.
The state is hiring more contact tracers, but can now handle only 300 cases a day.

This election, one of President Donald Trump’s most influential advocates is 26-year-old Charlie Kirk, who has developed a unique bond with the first family. The conservative star dines with the president at Mar-a-Lago and rang in the new year there. During each of the last two winters, he used the club to hold a formal fundraiser for his nonprofit, Turning Point USA, that featured Donald Trump Jr.
At a Turning Point event in June, the president, addressing the crowd, said, “Let us also show our appreciation to my good friend, Charlie. I’ll tell you, Charlie is some piece of work who is mobilizing a new generation of pro-American student activists.” On a Turning Point webpage soliciting donations, Trump Jr., a close friend of Kirk’s, is quoted as saying, “I’m convinced that the work by Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk will win back the future of America.”
The tax-exempt charity says its mission is to educate “students about the importance of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and capitalism.” As its profile has risen, its revenue has ballooned, reaching $28 million, a sevenfold increase in four years.
But behind the scenes, Turning Point USA has entered into questionable financial arrangements, particularly involving Kirk’s mentor, William Montgomery, the lesser-known co-founder who is credited with discovering Kirk. Montgomery, 80, an Illinois entrepreneur and onetime Tea Party activist, is one of three Turning Point insiders who have won lucrative deals from the group to handle its printing, payroll processing and fundraising.
The nonprofit has also made misleading assertions about its finances to state and federal regulators, according to interviews and an examination of tax and business records.
Charities are required to conduct annual independent audits certifying their books are sound in order to fundraise in more than a dozen states. But the accounting firm Turning Point uses has engaged in multiple business relationships with Montgomery, who for years served as its treasurer. The dynamic, experts say, imperils independence and undermines the credibility of Turning Point’s financial statements, including its federal tax returns — an issue of significance at a moment when more and more cash is flowing into the organization’s coffers.
“This raises real questions about the legitimacy of the return,” Philip Hackney, a University of Pittsburgh School of Law professor who formerly worked in the IRS’ chief counsel’s office, told ProPublica. “It makes it difficult to trust what is reported and begins to raise the possibility that it’s a fraudulent statement.”
The IRS requires, under the penalty of perjury, that charities attest whether they received an independent audit. Both Kirk and the co-founder have signed off on Turning Point’s filings.
In response to questions from ProPublica, Sally Wagenmaker, an attorney for the nonprofit, said that payments to businesses belonging to organization officials “provided a compelling operational benefit in Turning Point’s best and other interests,” and that they were “in full compliance with TPUSA’s IRS-compliant conflict of interest policy.”
Andrew Kolvet, a Turning Point spokesman, said the business relationship between the group’s auditor and its former treasurer is not significant and maintained the accounting firm is indeed an independent company. Another potential issue, ProPublica found, is that the license of the firm expired in late 2018, though the one that personally belongs to the firm’s managing partner has not.
Turning Point was founded in 2012 by Kirk, then 18, and Montgomery, who invested in the young activist after hearing him speak at a small college in the state. At the 2016 Republican National Convention, Kirk met Trump Jr. and would soon accompany him on the road as an assistant. As Turning Point has thrived, Kirk’s salary has grown from $27,000 to nearly $300,000, and he no longer lives with his parents — last May he bought a $855,000 two-bedroom, two-bathroom oceanfront condo in Longboat Key, Florida, county property records show.
Over the last year, the president has delivered remarks at the organization’s conferences threeseparatetimes. At the group’s December 2018 Mar-a-Lago affair, the president’s eldest son helped it haul in nearly $5 million, tax records show. Recently, Kirk published a book called “The MAGA Doctrine,” which Trump and his son promoted on Twitter.
For his part, Montgomery, whose Facebook profile picture features him posing with Trump Jr., left Turning Point last April, when, Kolvet said, his term as a board member ended. Two months later, Kirk effusively praised Montgomery in a blog post, celebrating his unmatched contributions to the nonprofit. “To anyone who has been impacted by my videos, podcast, TPUSA, our chapters, literature, events, conferences, field programs, or any speeches I have given,” Kirk wrote, “you have Bill Montgomery to thank for investing in an 18-year-old with a vision — when everyone else thought it was impossible, foolish, and deemed for failure.”
Montgomery, Kolvet told ProPublica, “remains a friend of the organization.”
Turning Point amplifies White House messaging by regularly tweeting memes and one-liners supportive of Trump administration policies or politics to hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers, and it retweets similar messages sent by Kirk, who is followed by nearly 2 million people. Meanwhile, Kirk’s and the group’s tweets are often retweeted by the president, promoting the young leader’s incendiary statements to more than 82 million followers, including his description of COVID-19 as the “China virus.”
Kirk cultivates the image of a young, serious executive, favoring button-down shirts and sport coats in public. He revels in provoking left-leaning activists and students on everything from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the effects of “white privilege,” which he calls a “racist lie.” Turning Point promotes clips of his campus confrontations on social media, typically boasting that Kirk has “destroyed” an unworthy adversary.
Turning Point says it now has chapters on more than 2,000 campuses, 272 employees and an affiliated nonprofit largely focused on supporting Trump. Yet as the organization has expanded, it has on occasion been the center of controversy. Politico found that Turning Point has fabricated its influence on college elections. And in 2017, The New Yorker drew attention to an organizational culture that appeared plagued with racism and indifferent to laws that prohibit charities from engaging in express political advocacy. The magazine obtained text messages written by the group’s former field director that said, “I HATE BLACK PEOPLE. Like fuck them all…I hate blacks. End of story.” (The sender of the text resigned and Kirk told the magazine, “Turning Point assessed the situation and took decisive action within 72 hours of being made aware of the issue.”)
ProPublica’s examination of Turning Point’s finances raises additional questions about the way the group is run, the reliability of its public disclosures and its approach to regulations governing nonprofits.
Turning Point is registered to fundraise in dozens of states across the country. Because of the group’s size, attorneys general and secretaries of state in 15 states — including New York, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Kansas — require it to file audits to remain in good standing. The work, each state’s statute invariably specifies, must be carried out by “an independent certified public accountant.”
The IRS does not require such an audit, but it asks about the audit’s status. On Turning Point’s last four federal tax returns, consistent with its state filings and spanning a period that covers July 2015 through June 2019, the group asserts that its financial statements are “audited by an independent accountant.”
But Turning Point’s accounting firm, the Stapleton Group, based in Orland Park, Illinois, has a significant tie to the charity. Montgomery, the charity’s co-founder, has served as a “business development advisor” for Stapleton, helping to bring clients to the firm. The company’s managing partner, Robert Stapleton, who handles Turning Point’s returns, has worked as Montgomery’s personal tax preparer, according to Stapleton. The firm, which employs a handful of people, was incorporated by the same suburban Chicago lawyer who, records show, formed a business entity Montgomery used to collect rent and make political contributions.
Robert Stapleton and the Stapleton Group did not respond directly to ProPublica. Instead, the firm provided comments through Kolvet.
Stapleton became Turning Point’s auditor after Montgomery introduced the firm to the organization, a referral for which Montgomery wasn’t compensated, Stapleton said through the spokesman. On his LinkedIn page and in a biography that once lived on Turning Point’s website, Montgomery identifies his connection to Stapleton’s firm; on the former, it states the affiliation began in 2010 and has continued to the present.
Montgomery received “no remuneration” from the firm and “acted in a business development capacity in his spare time and on commission only” in 2011, according to Stapleton. Turning Point, Kolvet said, “is confident in the independence of any services provided by The Stapleton Group.”
In a statement, the firm said, “The Stapleton Group upholds the highest levels of integrity and independence while conducting audits and reviews for many businesses and organizations of all sizes.”
Until the spring of last year, records show, Montgomery served on Turning Point’s board and as its secretary and treasurer, giving him oversight of Turning Point’s financial books and custody over its corporate records, according to the group’s bylaws. At one point, he was solely responsible for fundraising and the spending of Turning Point’s cash, according to charity records filed in New Mexico.
“If Montgomery has a strong relationship with the auditor, then there is a clear conflict there,” said Tzachi Zach, an Ohio State University accounting professor. “Other than the auditor being hired, there should be no other relationship between the auditor and the nonprofit.”
James Fishman, a former assistant attorney general in the New York attorney general’s office, said that, on the question of independence, Turning Point’s audit arrangement “does not pass the smell test. If an attorney general looked closely, they would find it wasn’t independent.”
In a letter dated July 7, and provided by Kolvet, Robert Stapleton wrote to Montgomery on company letterhead asking him to “immediately correct” his LinkedIn profile that claimed he is “associated with the Stapleton Group.” The letter was dated two weeks after ProPublica first inquired about Montgomery’s ties to the accounting firm; Montgomery’s LinkedIn profile still identifies him as a “business development advisor” for Stapleton.
The nonprofit’s most recent publicly available audit, signed by the “The Stapleton Group” in May 2019, presents an additional issue. The firm’s license to practice expired in late 2018, according to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, the state agency that regulates occupational licenses. In Illinois, state law prohibits certified public accounting firms with an expired license from conducting audits.
Stapleton said his firm “is aware and is in the process of rectifying the issue,” and through Kolvet provided a copy of his personal CPA license to ProPublica. Wagenmaker, the Turning Point attorney, wouldn’t provide a copy of the group’s most recent audit, which is not yet public and captures the nonprofit’s finances through last July. She also wouldn’t confirm whether it was carried out by the Stapleton Group.
Montgomery hasn’t responded to calls and emails seeking comment.
During Montgomery’s time at Turning Point, he personally benefited from several of the group’s business arrangements. Between July 2017 and June 2019, tax records show, Turning Point paid more than $430,000 to a printing shop owned by Montgomery, and gave him an additional $25,000 for the rental of a small office space. The compensation was on top of the direct income he received from Turning Point, which earned him close to $200,000 during the same period.
Doug De Groote, the organization’s board secretary, said the vendor payments to Montgomery “represent fair market value or lower for the trade services received.” He added, “These decisions were made with Mr. Montgomery recused and with the organization’s best interest paramount.”
Turning Point similarly said it was getting a better deal by using the payroll processing firm owned by the organization’s current treasurer, Tom Sodeika. In late 2018, the nonprofit tapped the services of his small, Illinois-based company, Precision Payroll of America. Turning Point paid Precision $51,072 for its services from late 2018 through last July, according to tax records. The amount, Kolvet said, was “at a significant discount below market rates and in full compliance with Turning Point conflict-of-interest policy.”
In January, Sodeika sold the company and relinquished all executive positions there. Turning Point would not say how much Sodeika sold Precision for or to whom he sold it, but Kolvet told ProPublica that “prior to the sale of the company” it provided services to Turning Point “at discounted market rates.”
Turning Point’s treasurers are not the only insiders who have reaped financial rewards from the nonprofit. It also appears to have steered extra cash to a highly paid employee through limited liability companies, business records show.
Stacy Sheridan, Turning Point’s “senior advancement director,” receives a salary of more than $180,000, according to the group’s latest tax filings, which also show over $200,000 flowing to two business entities — GSM Strategy LLC and Lionrock Ventures LLC — that were paid for fundraising. The return does not disclose who is behind both companies, neither of which has a website. But corporate records for GSM and Lionrock include Sheridan’s name and addresses associated with her.
When asked about the LLC payments, neither Kolvet nor Sheridan provided a comment. On their own, the veiled arrangements may pass legal muster, but Hackney, the former IRS official, said they could be part of a larger, troubling pattern.
“As the number of self-interested transactions go up,” he said, “the potential goes up for the possibility that the organization is being operated for the private interests of those who control the organization.”

0,2020-07-21T10:29:15+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/we-asked-right-wing-flack-michael-caputo-why-hes-in-charge-of-dr-faucis-schedule-his-response-whats-with-the-attitude/,We asked right-wing flack Michael Caputo why he’s in charge of Dr. Fauci’s schedule. His response: ‘What’s with the attitude?’,"Last week the Washington Post published a report titled “Fauci is sidelined by the White House as he steps up blunt talk on pandemic,” which revealed that President Trump had not sought the counsel of the government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, in more than a month.
But as the Trump administration has strayed from the advice of many of its scientists and public health experts, the White House has moved to sideline Fauci, scuttled some of his planned TV appearances and largely kept him out of the Oval Office for more than a month even as coronavirus infections surge in large swaths of the country.
The 2,500-word report only briefly touches on the official who does that scuttling: a man named Michael Caputo, a 2016 Trump campaign aide who has been described as a conspiracy theorist with racist views and is closely allied with former Trump adviser Roger Stone.
It’s not clear when Caputo took control of Fauci’s media calendar. In a brief conversation with Salon, he replied, “Weeks ago.” Asked if he could ballpark how many weeks that was, Caputo replied, “No.”
The administration hired Caputo as deputy press secretary for Health and Human Services sometime in early to mid-April, the month the coronavirus was to “miraculously” disappear, according to the president.
In reality, it was the month that reports about Trump’s displeasure with Fauci began to surface. Caputo deleted more than 1,000 of tweets in early April, many of which were graphic or patently offensive, suggesting he was not expecting to be hired at the time.
Officials have suggested to Salon, in the context of Fauci’s recent media appearances, that if HHS were indeed trying to silence the longtime public servant, it’s not doing a good job of it.
It’s unlikely that the administration could silence Fauci outright without drawing intense public backlash, but Caputo has selectively muzzled the eminent disease expert, especially when he darkens or contradicts White House messaging. Per the Post:
The tension between the White House and Fauci was on full display last Sunday, when CBS host Margaret Brennan told millions of viewers that “Face the Nation” had tried for three months to interview him.
White House communications officials, who must approve television appearances related to the coronavirus, responded by allowing Fauci spots this week on PBS NewsHour, a CNN town hall with Sanjay Gupta and NBC’s “Meet the Press” during the prime Sunday morning slot, according to one person familiar with the situation.
  Then Fauci joined a Facebook Live event on Tuesday with Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), disputing Trump’s assertions that a lower death rate showed the country’s progress against the pandemic. Fauci called it “a false narrative” and warned, “Don’t get yourself into false complacency.”
Fauci did not end up making any of the scheduled appearances. The White House canceled them after his Tuesday remarks, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relate behind-the-scenes conversations.
Additionally, Fauci himself has insinuated that the Trump administration was suppressing his voice. A page dedicated to his media appearances on his agency’s website is missing the months of May and June entirely.
Caputo told Salon that he handles all of Fauci’s media and press and has final say on media calendars for “six different doctors and scientists,” including Fauci.
Dr. Deborah Birx, CDC head Dr. Robert Redfield and Surgeon General Jerome Adams are also under HHS purview, as are Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir and HHS Secretary Alex Azar.
When Salon asked Caputo about the Post’s report that he had thwarted some of Fauci’s television appearances, which including an invitation from MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, Caputo replied that he simply cycled officials through in rotation.
“We have six different scientists and doctors who we use,” he explained. “We get requests from different networks and different shows, and we have far more than just one person we work with. You can’t have all of them on at the same time.”
“Sometimes we are utilizing different voices and different scientists. Fauci is a particularly good one,” he said. “But every day, every network show, presents a different challenge, and we have a wide variety of solutions.”
Caputo then asked if this story was going to run while Fauci’s PBS interview aired last Friday. He was told that was not a goal.
“You would look really bad if you did,” he said, emphasizing how “stupid” it would be to run a story about him blocking Fauci while Fauci was on TV.
“I chose Fauci for PBS tonight,” Caputo continued, contradicting the Post report that the White House gave PBS the nod. “Every single booker asks for Fauci. I give them the person who fits.”
Caputo declined to get into the nitty-gritty of his formula for determining who fits, but did explain his process. “I instruct my team to provide the outlet and point of contact, but not to bother me with the name of the scientist or doctor,” he said. “I can do that.”
If that’s true, then the gatekeeper of public access to critical information from health officials does not care about what information media outlets want. It is a highly unorthodox way to run media relations at any time, not to mention at the federal government’s public health nerve center in the middle of a pandemic.
Journalists often contact government experts precisely because they have specific questions for a specific official, based on that official’s area of medical or scientific expertise. But Caputo, who has no medical or scientific background, suggested that he considers nothing beyond availability and his own gut instincts.
(The voicemail message at the HHS Office of Public Affairs instructs journalists to “please leave your name, outlet, request and contact information.”)
The Post report complicates Caputo’s claim that he calls the shots, alleging that he doesn’t make decisions about Fauci without first consulting the White House:
Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump ally, approves Fauci’s television appearances, with input from the White House, said one of the senior administration officials. Several White House aides view Fauci’s interviews as unhelpful and say they’re frustrated he has expressed interest in appearing on programs such as MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which are hostile to the administration. That one was rejected.
Salon asked Caputo why the deputy press secretary for HHS would tell employees not to “bother” him by including a scientist’s name.
“What’s with your attitude?” Caputo responded. “Don’t give me this — this attitude.”
Salon responded that no disrespect was intended, and Caputo instructed us to try another press contact at the department. (Salon had done so.)
Salon then asked Caputo, twice, whether he had spoken about Roger Stone at any time with HHS officials or with White House hiring chief John McEntee, or with McEntee’s deputy, 23-year-old James Bacon.
Caputo hung up.
Reached for comment, a spokeswoman for the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease said, “The NIAID Office of Communications and Government Relations coordinates media interviews for Dr. Fauci, the director of NIAID. NIAID (part of NIH), like all agencies part of HHS, has always followed HHS’s coordinating process for interviews.”
The spokeswoman did not reply when asked whether that process now involved Caputo, or when he took over Fauci’s calendar.
Michael Caputo has spent a sizable portion of his colorful life in political PR, or what might appear to be PR.
After graduating from high school in Buffalo, New York, Caputo did PR for the Army. He left the Army for college, after which he promoted Ronald Reagan’s agenda in Central America with Lt. Col. Oliver North. He also worked media relations for President George H.W. Bush’s losing 1992 campaign.
Somewhere in there he befriended Roger Stone and took up an apprenticeship with the modern master of political dark arts. For a while Caputo was Stone’s driver.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, Caputo moved to Russia, where he worked for President Boris Yeltsin and later as a consultant charged with rehabilitating Vladimir Putin’s image in the U.S. He has claimed he was once shot in Russia during a drunken donnybrook.
When Caputo returned to the U.S. he returned into the GOP operative world, in 2007 running a website designed to smear Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York. Spitzer was forced to resign the following year amid a prostitution scandal.
At some point Caputo had befriended Donald Trump, and in 2014 he conceived a PR scheme to secure Trump’s bid for the Buffalo Bills NFL team, creating a fake organization and hiring a fake founder — a double-amputee cancer survivor — to gin up sympathy.
Caputo used the organization to orchestrate a bare-knuckle smear campaign targeting Trump’s chief competitor for the Buffalo team, Jon Bon Jovi, who later said he needed “years of therapy” to get over it.
Bon Jovi and Trump both lost their bids to buy the Bills.
In the spring 2016 Caputo joined the Trump campaign, but was forced to quit in June when he celebrated the sacking of former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski by tweeting, “Ding dong the witch is dead!”, adding a picture of the Wicked Witch of the East from “The Wizard of Oz,” her feet protruding from under the house that crushed her.
A month earlier, when Caputo was still with the campaign, he and Roger Stone met with a Russian expatriate living in Florida named Henry Greenberg — his original name was Henry Oknyansky — who offered to sell them dirt on Hillary Clinton.
In 2018 the Washington Post acquired text messages between Caputo and Stone in which they called Greenberg “the Russian.” In his earlier testimony to Congress, Caputo had claimed that he and Stone did not know Greenberg and/or Oknyansky was Russian.
That reaped him high praise:
Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2017
Former special counsel Robert Mueller also interviewed Caputo during his investigation into Russian election interference. Caputo likened those interviews to a proctology exam, adding that Mueller knew “more about the campaign than anyone who ever worked there.”
Mueller’s team never charged Caputo with any crime, but they did indict and convict Stone, whom Caputo counts a close friend to this day.
During the campaign, Stone had communicated with “Guccifer 2.0,” the apparent nom de guerre for a group of Russian intelligence officials who funneled stolen Democratic Party emails to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Stone later communicated with Assange directly, and was alleged in testimony by Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and Michael Cohen to have told Trump that email dumps were coming.
This contradicted claims that Trump made to Mueller in sworn written responses.
In January, with the Senate trial of Trump’s impeachment kicking into high gear, Caputo published a book titled, “The Ukraine Hoax: How Decades of Corruption in the Former Soviet Republic Led to Trump’s Phony Impeachment.”
The next month the Senate acquitted Trump, and Stone was sentenced to 40 months in federal prison for obstructing a congressional inquiry into the president, among other felonies.
It is still not clear how or why Caputo’s name came before HHS.
Sometime in April, however, someone placed him in the Department of Health and Human Services — although he has no background in medicine or science, and the United States was in the opening weeks of the worst health crisis in a century.
That was the month that Trump had foretold would “miraculously” vanquish the global coronavirus pandemic, and the month when Fauci’s future in the administration was first seriously thrown into doubt.
“Installing Caputo allows the White House to further control [Alex] Azar’s communications strategy,” Politico reported at the time. Administration officials reportedly believed that Azar, the HHS secretary, had been leaking negative stories about Trump to the press in order to buttress his own record on the pandemic response.
It didn’t take long for Caputo’s deleted tweets to surface.
In late April, CNN uncovered more than 1,300 tweets, many of them racist, misogynistic, cruel and riddled with coronavirus conspiracy theories. Caputo had posted the tweets between February and early April, mere days before his on-boarding at HHS, indicating that he might not himself have expected to be hired for a government position.
Responding to a conspiracy theory that Americans brought the coronavirus to China, Caputo tweeted on March 12 that “millions of Chinese suck the blood out of rabid bats as an appetizer and eat the ass out of anteaters.”
Caputo suggested in a March 8 tweet that a Democratic “strategy to defeat” Trump required hundreds of thousands of American deaths. He referenced James Hodgkinson, a left-wing activist with record of domestic violence who shot Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., during a congressional baseball practice in 2017.
“Coronavirus is the Democrats’ new Russia, their new Ukraine,” he added. “And nobody will believe them except their zombies.”
“For the Democrat 2020 victory strategy to work, 100,000+ Americans have to die,” he posted March 11. “For the Democrat 2020 victory strategy to work, you have to believe the media.”
A few days after that story broke, CNN unearthed still more deleted tweets, these tracing back to 2019 and including vile remarks about women.
In December 2019, Caputo posted a reply to former FBI employee Lisa Page, a favorite target of the president’s, with a crass reference to oral sex, writing, “what’s that on your chin.”
In another, he wrote:
“I never thought you broke the law, Lisa — sleeping around with married men is quite legal. Your political opinions also aren’t illegal, just unethical at work, like your affairs. You got dragged into this for hate and love — your hate for Trump and your love for, well, you know.” He added a GIF of a train heading into a tunnel.
In other tweets from this year, Caputo kept calling women “dogface”: “look at this dogface”; “I would never sleep with you, dog-face”; “you have a dogface.”
In October 2019, with impeachment in full swing, Caputo attacked then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, firing off a series of tweets calling him a “piece of shit,” a “traitor,” a “scumbag” and a “seditionist.”
CNN has cached the tweets here.
Additionally, Caputo has apparently owed substantial sums in back taxes, in both New York and Florida. He once complained that the Mueller investigation had almost bankrupted him, but he appears to have been saved from that fate when his self-published GoFundMe page pulled in more than $350,000, outstripping its stated goal by $200,000.
Even a top administration salary, while not petty, is certainly not lucrative, and deputy press secretary positions normally go to junior or up-and-coming officials, not veteran operatives of Caputo’s experience who do not take well to bureaucracy and do not expect to be bossed around.
After Salon’s call with Caputo, an HHS press officer sent an email offering to field follow-ups questions. Our follow-up emails were unanswered.
The media contact page at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — the agency Fauci has helmed for more than 35 years — says “Content last reviewed April 7, 2020.”
Fauci’s own “in the news” page shows a conspicuous two-month gap in on-air appearances between April and July.
In a contentious June 24 call with reporters, Caputo blasted back at questions about the White House’s apparent efforts to discredit Fauci, a Presidential Medal of Freedom honoree.
“The reason why we put this call together so quickly and why we have upwards of 75 reporters on this call is because you’ve been spun up,” he yawped, after going nearly an hour without saying anything.
“Somebody has given you disinformation,” said Caputo, who himself had spread coronavirus disinformation with palpable contempt just a few months prior. “Do you understand? I’m old enough to remember when it was considered dishonest to undermine public confidence in the public health system.”
The PR veteran later took a more subtle approach.
“We have great faith in the capacity of all of our scientists and doctors on the coronavirus taskforce to impart necessary public health information,” Caputo said in a statement. “People like Admiral (Brett) Giroir, Surgeon General (Jerome) Adams and others are carrying these messages very effectively.”
He did not mention Fauci.
The White House and Roger Stone did not reply to multiple requests for comment. Fauci could not be reached for comment.

“Among the Democrats’ concerns is that a Senate investigation being led by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has become a vehicle for ‘laundering’ a foreign influence campaign to damage Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, according to two people familiar with the demand,” reported Natasha Bertrand. “Though the letter did not mention the Johnson investigation, it included a classified addendum that the two sources say identified the probe as one of the sources of their concern.”
The letter was signed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Senate Intelligence Committee ranking member Mark Warner (D-VA).
Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, opened the investigation ostensibly to audit the origins of the Russia investigation in the previous administration. But even some Republicans have raised concerns that the overly political nature of the probe will backfire on them.

In a 2008 interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Hollander was outed for his anti-women leanings as he ranted about “cut[ting] out the feminazi, feminist women’s studies programs” from Columbia University.
Women “are a suspect class,” he claimed. “Every time they open their mouths, I begin to suspect something.”
“You have issues, don’t you?” asked Cavuto.
“No, the point is, if you look at equal pay per unit of time, or equal pay, or pay per unit of risk, girls are making more than guys,” said Hollander.
He ultimately sued the Institute for Research on Women & Gender at Columbia University.
Hollander previously “represented a New Jersey woman suing the U.S. Selective Service System for the ability to register for the draft,” said the New Jersey Globe.
Judge Salas had agreed to hear the case in 2015, but dismissed part of the suit in 2019. There was still another part of the case pending, however, Hollander allegedly shot himself after killing Salas’ 20-year-old son and severely injuring her husband.
“In the past, Hollander had unsuccessfully argued in New York that Ladies Nights offering free drinks to women violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution,” the report also said.

“These kids have got to get back to school,” Gov. Parson told local St. Louis talk radio host Marc Cox. “They’re at the lowest risk possible. And if they do get COVID-19, which they will — and they will when they go to school — they’re not going to the hospitals. They’re not going to have to sit in doctor’s offices. They’re going to go home and they’re going to get over it.”
“We gotta move on,” Parson added, as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “We can’t just let this thing stop us in our tracks.”
Last week Gov. Parson announced he is spending $15 million of COVID-19 federal relief funds to promote tourism to his state.
Some children who have contracted the coronavirus and recovered from COVID-19 are being hospitalized with a rare inflammatory blood disease, Multisystem-Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, or MIS-C.
“The youngest confirmed patient was just a few weeks old,” The New York Times reported last month. “At least four children — one in Louisiana and three in New York — are reported to have died from the condition.”
Children who don’t suffer from MIS-C have also died after contracting the coronavirus. And children can also spread the disease to adults.
Here’s audio of the governor’s remarks:

On social media many expressed anger and disgust over the governor’s remarks.
My mother lives in Missouri and is an elderly cancer survivor. We have a child with Down Syndrome in our family who lives there. @mikeparson is completely disregarding the safety of his constituents, especially those in the high-risk category, with his flippant, reckless comment.

0,2020-07-20T20:37:11+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/aol-co-founder-warns-us-wont-return-to-its-pre-coronavirus-economy-anytime-soon/,AOL co-founder warns US won’t return to its ‘pre-coronavirus economy’ anytime soon,"The U.S. won’t be getting back to normal anytime soon — certainly not in 2020. Tech entrepreneur Steve Case, a co-founder of America Online and author of the 2016 book “The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur’s Vision of the Future,” addresses that new economic reality in a July 19 op-ed for the Washington Post — and stresses that Congress shouldn’t think in a pre-coronavirus way.
“This week, Congress will likely take up the next steps in the economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Case explains. “If the package is like previous efforts, it will focus on trying to turn back the clock to February 2020 — treating the economy as if it were Sleeping Beauty, merely needing to be awakened to be fully restored. This strategy is a mistake: Congress needs to stop solely backing efforts to restore the old economic reality and focus on how to develop a new one.”
The AOL co-founder goes on to say that even in the “pre-coronavirus economy,” many Americans “were left behind.” And Case lists three ways in which “Congress can help launch a new, more equitable era of entrepreneurship.”
Case’s first recommendation is to “make it easier for the earliest-stage start-ups to receive (Paycheck Protection Program) dollars and for all start-ups to access the Main Street Relief Fund.”
“PPP loans,” Case notes, “go to existing businesses to maintain jobs but not to new businesses that want to create them.” And his second recommendation is that “the government needs to be a counterweight to private capital that exacerbates geographic disparities in opportunity as the country responds to the crisis.”
“The pandemic is a devastating tragedy, but adversity tends to be met by the creation of new industries and new businesses,” Case observes. “This crisis will stir innovations in medicine, goods and services delivered at home, remote work and learning, and more. Where will these new firms grow? If the decision is left to the private sector alone, almost all of them will be in three states: New York, California and Massachusetts, which attract 75% of all venture capital. Great ideas to respond to this crisis are spread widely across the country — but capital is not.”
Case’s third recommendation is for “lawmakers” to “step in to address unintended inequalities of opportunity for female and minority entrepreneurs caused by the earlier relief bills.”
“Because these programs fund only existing businesses,” Case observes, “they reinforce opportunity gaps. Communities with thriving businesses get more PPP and Main Street aid; those that have lacked capital to get businesses off the ground in the past see little help now. The solution would be for Congress to direct unused PPP funds to start-ups led by female entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs of color, creating opportunities where they have not existed before.”

“Part of Trump’s reelection strategy is to scare the white suburbs, which polls show have soured on him, with ‘urban’ (read: minority) violence,” University of Michigan history professor Juan Cole wrote Monday for his website Informed Comment.
“It now appears clear that part of that strategy is to send federal agents dressed like Iraq War troops to Democratic-run cities, on the pretext of protecting federal property, and then for them to attack and provoke Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police protesters, causing violence to escalate and using it… to scare the suburbs,” Cole continued. “The exercise also has the advantage for Trump of entrenching a new form of secret police and of turning federal agents into instruments of his authoritarianism.”
As Cole noted, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo on Sunday that U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf are “weighing in on” similar plans for other cities, “and you’ll see something rolled out this week, as we start to go in and make sure that the communities—whether it’s Chicago or Portland or Milwaukee or someplace across the heartland of the country—we need to make sure their communities are safe.”
Wolf made clear in a Monday appearance on Fox News that the administration will deploy federal law enforcement with or without the cooperation of local officials, saying that “I don’t need invitations by the state, state mayors, or state governors, to do our job. We’re going to do that, whether they like us there or not.”
In a Sunday afternoon tweet about Portland and “The Radical Left Democrats, who totally control” presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Trump name-checked not only Chicago but also New York and Philadelphia:
The Radical Left Democrats, who totally control Biden, will destroy our Country as we know it. Unimaginably bad things would happen to America. Look at Portland, where the pols are just fine with 50 days of anarchy. We sent in help. Look at New York, Chicago, Philadelphia. NO!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2020
Asked by Fox News host Chris Wallace on Sunday what he is going to do about shooting deaths in New York and Chicago, the president said: “I explain it very simply by saying that they’re Democrat-run cities, they are liberally run. They are stupidly run. We have forced them in Seattle to end the CHOP because, you know, we were going in that following day. You probably have heard it. We were getting ready to go in. We were all set, and when they heard that we were going they set their police force.”
The Chicago Tribune reported Monday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “is crafting plans to deploy about 150 federal agents” to the city this week.
In response to the administration targeting her city, Chicago Sun-Times columnist Lynn Sweet wrote Monday that “if Trump sends a Portland-style action to Chicago, it would represent a dramatic escalation between Trump and Mayor Lori Lightfoot regarding how to deal with the city’s ongoing battles against gun violence and demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality.”
Sweet also framed the potential “military-style response” to Black Lives Matter protests in Chicago sparked by Minnesota police killing of George Floyd as part of the president’s effort to win in November, writing that “Chicago is one of several liberal, Democratic-run cities targeted by Trump in coordination with his reelection campaign to reinforce his message that he is for ‘law and order’ while framing rival Joe Biden as soft on crime and anti-police.”
Former Labor Secretary and current University of California, Berkeley professor Robert Reich as well as Democratic Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler made similar observations about the Oregon city last week:
The governor of Oregon asked tha Acting Secretary of Homeland Security to remove federal troops from Portland. The Acting Secretary refused.
This should tell you all you need to know about Trump’s strategy to fuel confrontation on the streets of America.

Portland Mayor @tedwheeler says Trump sending troops to local cities is a strategy to “use federal troops to bolster his sagging polling data. It is an absolute abuse of federal law enforcement officials.” pic.twitter.com/v7b8RmcoMN

Though both local and state officials in Oregon have warned that the federal presence in Portland is making the situation worse not better, the Washington Post‘s Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman argued last week that there “is reason to believe that this is exactly what the Trump administration wants.” They wrote:
We know Trump wants these scenes to be playing out on people’s televisions in faraway states, such as—to select a few at random—Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Florida.
And given that his homeland security chief is actively ignoring local officials’ demands that he pull out federal law enforcement—in a manner that those officials say is inflaming the situation—it’s reasonable to surmise that escalation is the whole point of these exercises in the first place.
Since video footage from Portland started circulating last week, the administration has faced condemnation from politicians at all levels, civil liberties advocates, and journalists. The crackdown also elicited separate lawsuits from the ACLU and Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who is suing DHS, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Protection Service, and their agents for violating “the civil rights of Oregonians.”
The conduct of federal agents in Oregon’s largest city and concerns that it will be replicated elsewhere in the country have provoked a promise from Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) to soon introduce an amendment to military spending legislation that would block the Trump administration from deploying U.S. law enforcement to other cities as well as alarm about what happens if Trump gets four more years in the White House.
“Portland may be a dumbshow for dummies, but it also looks like a dress rehearsal,” Esquire columnist Charles Pierce warned last week. “This is not an ‘authoritarian impulse.’ This is authoritarian government—straight, no chaser. And this administration has a powerful thirst for it. It will do anything if it thinks it can get away with it in order to benefit a president* who wants to bring the Republic down on his head.”
Christopher David, a 53-year-old disabled Navy veteran whose encounter with federal police in Portland went viral over the weekend, told The Independent that Trump “is trying to see how far he can push it in Portland and create some kind of model for other cities so he can stir up enough chaos and discontent to try and win the election again. All of this is just doubling down on his strategy of division and chaos.”
Noting David’s comments, Common Dreams columnist Michael Winship wrote Monday that “even worse, it conceivably could be connected to a greater scheme designed to steal the November election. He pointed to “a terrific new piece” by Andy Kroll in Rolling Stone headlined, “The Plot Against America: The GOP’s Plan to Suppress the Vote and Sabotage the Election.”
“We need to wise up and prepare for the onslaught,” Winship argued. “Trump just refused to tell Chris Wallace of Fox News whether or not he’ll accept the election results. Donald Trump is a menace who if he sees he’s losing bigtime—and he does—won’t hesitate to repress the vote count so that he can declare a second term and because, in his words, ‘I’ve been very unfairly treated.’ Donald Trump puts the petty in petty tyrant but he’s a tyrant, nonetheless. Be very afraid.”

“We are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election and November,” the letter states.
There’s little information to glean precisely what foreign interference campaign lawmakers might be referring to. The letter, sent by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Sen. Charles Schumer, and Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Mark Warner, was sent with a classified attachment presumably giving more specifics.
The U.S. intelligence community has repeatedly warned that such campaigns are indeed serious and ongoing, with Wray testifying last year that Russia in particular remains “absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections.”

CNN’s Fareed Zakaria took Trump to task on June 20, slamming the president for being so painfully out of touch during the pandemic.
When Trump was interviewed by Fox News’ Chris Wallace on Friday, July 17— an interview that aired over the weekend — he bragged about taking a mental acuity test and challenged former Vice President Joe Biden to take the same test. But Zakaria told CNN’s Brianna Keilar that Trump’s ludicrous claims about the United States’ coronavirus response are hardly a demonstration of his intellectual fitness.
“The truth is, Brianna, you don’t need to talk to experts, you don’t need to talk to leaders — all you have to do is look at the numbers,” Zakaria told Keilar. “If the president thinks that the United States is doing well in the coronavirus pandemic compared to the rest of the rich countries in the world, the advanced world, he needs to take another cognitive test. Because the United Sates is basically at the bottom of the heap. The United States, roughly speaking, has ten times the number of daily deaths that Europe has. Many European countries have a few hundred cases every day; Florida alone is up to 10,000 cases a day. So, we’re not just doing worse; we’re doing worse by an order of magnitude — and the data makes this absolutely clear.”

Arizona, for decades, was a deep red state that was synonymous with the Barry Goldwater school of right-wing conservatism. But Arizona has evolved into a swing state, and journalists Lauren Gambino and Maanvi Singh stress — in a July 20 article for The Guardian — that it could play an important role in deciding whether or not President Donald Trump wins a second term.
“With less than four months until the election,” Gambino and Singh explain, “polls show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead of the president in Arizona — a state Trump won in 2016 by fewer than four percentage points, a far narrower margin than past Republican nominees. Then, in 2018, in November’s midterm elections, young Latino voters cast votes in record numbers, joining white moderates in the suburbs, to elect Kyrsten Sinema — the first Democrat to win a U.S. senate seat in Arizona in decades.”
Sinema, a very centrist Democrat, now holds the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. And Arizona’s other U.S. Senate seat is presently held by Sen. Martha McSally — the same seat that, for many years, was held by Sen. Barry Goldwater and later, Sen. John McCain (who was proud to call himself a “Goldwater Republican” or “Goldwater conservative”). McSally is up for reelection this year, and poll after poll has shown her trailing Democrat Mark Kelly.
At this point, it would be premature to call Arizona a blue state: Arizona still has a far-right Republican governor, Doug Ducey. But it has definitely evolved into a swing state. And as Gambino and Singh point out, one of the key factors in that evolution has been Arizona’s large Latino population.
“While Trump’s embrace of hardline, anti-immigrant rhetoric seemed to rally his base in the Midwest,” Gambino and Singh point out, “operatives in both parties believe it has hurt him in Arizona — a border state where many Republicans were trying to move beyond the divisive politics that had tarnished their brand with Latino voters.”
Arizona is where Republicans in the state legislature, in 2010, unveiled the draconian Senate Bill 1070 — which, Gambino and Singh note, “included a provision requiring law enforcement to determine the immigration status of anyone officers had ‘reasonable suspicion’ to believe was in the country illegally. The political, economic and cultural backlash was swift: businesses, sports teams, musicians — even the City of Los Angeles — boycotted the state.”
During her 2018 campaign, Sinema aggressively courted Latino voters and aired a Spanish-language ad:
<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>
Marisa Franco, co-founder of the Latino group Mijente, believes that SB1070 played a key role in turning Arizona into a swing state.
“There was political overreach from the right, and SB 1070 was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Franco told The Guardian. “It awakened an electorate that’s, I think, more justice-minded.”
Moreover, Franco believes that Arizona might be on its way to becoming a blue state.
“I think it’s very possible for Arizona to turn not just blue, but even a shade further,” Franco told The Guardian. “There’s potential for Arizona to support not just the most moderate Democratic agenda, but go beyond that.”

Many believe that the falling poll numbers for Donald Trump are a measure of his mishandling the coronavirus pandemic to the point of calamity or his divisiveness in the face of a racial crisis.  While these things may be partially true, there is a far more important, overriding factor: his inability to hold ongoing rallies.
His loss of continual exposure to the public has meant his supporters would separate enough to see reality for themselves. This is a phenomenon mental health experts have spoken about in The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: how his continual exposure through the presidency would make him uncontainable, and we issued a “Prescription for Survival” in March 2020, to highlight how his removal or, if not, at least removal of influence was necessary for our collective health.
Mental disease could be more contagious than other forms of infection since it does not require physical exposure but only emotional bonds.
There are many medically unjustifiable misconceptions we have about mental disease, but none is perhaps as consequential as the denial that it can be contagious.  Indeed, its contagion could be more efficient than other forms of infection since it does not require physical exposure but only emotional bonds.  We noted at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic that the more important pandemic to gain control over was “the mental health pandemic.”
Weakened hosts, an environment that facilitates transmission, and our lack of consideration even of the possibility—even among some psychiatrists wedded to an atomistic view of people—has made Americans more vulnerable.  In addition, poor mental health contributes to denial, and therefore those who are the most affected are the least likely to admit that anything is wrong.  Bioterrorism is frightening, but psychological warfare even more so, for it hijacks the very mind that is capable of protecting itself.
My focus as a preventive psychiatrist has been the ecology surrounding individuals.  Contagion of mental symptoms is common in public hospital and prison settings, where there are high concentrations of untreated, severe mental disturbances.  Severe symptoms can spread among family members, criminal co-conspirators, gangs, and other tight-knit groups.  A colleague and collaborator at the World Health Organization, Dr. Gary Slutkin, has long advocated that we consider violence and other behavior an infectious disease whose spread we can interrupt.  International terrorism and suicide are known to be contagious, for example.  Effective prevention, therefore, requires population-level interventions and application of psychiatric principles to systems, institutions, and cultures.  The last course I designed for students at Yale Law School was one of translating law into social policies that prevent violence and further societal health.
Three conditions are necessary for the spread of mental symptoms:
1. Severe pathology in an influential figure
The transmission of mental symptoms has been given different names: induced delusional disorder, shared psychosis, folie à deux, trois, quatre,…, or millions—depending on the number affected—or mass hysteria when affecting a whole population.  All describe the same phenomenon, but none are satisfactory.  The latest, induced delusional disorder, focuses on the most commonly transmitted symptom, delusions, but does not cover other possible symptoms, such as mood.  Shared psychosis captures the syndrome-like severity, but is a misnomer because it often does not involve actual psychosis.  Folie à deux, or “madness in two,” is perhaps the most preferred but a foreign phrase.  Finally, “mass hysteria” describes well the frenzied quality that arises from the sharing of symptoms among crowds, but often does not actually involve symptoms of “hysteria”, or histrionics.  The important feature is that mental symptoms are not confined to the person; they take hold and spread across interpersonal boundaries, just as they initially take over one portion, and then eventually the whole of the mind of an individual.
Severe psychopathology in an influential figure, therefore, transmits to others or a group, until the exposed persons or groups come to feel, think, and behave as if they had the same disorder as the primary person.  Unlike normal social dynamics, where enthusiasm, common purpose, or even outrage can be “infectious” but individuals retain their uniqueness, the spread of pathology is especially efficient and deleterious, taking over the personalities of those involved.
Transmission happens more readily in vulnerable persons, but those who succumb are not necessarily of unsound mind to start.  Delusions of persecution or general paranoia are the most common to transmit, but even bizarre beliefs, such as the primary person being of divine origin, are not rare.  Exposure to actual delusions is unlike exposure to strategic lies or simple misinformation; they are more infectious because the primary person is genuinely convinced of them and the emotional pressures for others also to believe them is stronger.  For example, when an influential figure holds the paranoid belief that a serious viral pandemic is a “hoax”, orchestrated by one’s enemies to bring down one’s presidency, it can be more emotionally persuasive than any reality and is difficult to correct.
2. Group members with high emotional investment
Another condition for the spread of mental disease is emotional investment.  Folie à deux describes shared madness within a pair, but here we will focus on folie à groupe, or the spread of mental symptoms in a group.  The group can be a household (folie à famille), a prison dormitory or cell-block, a religious or other highly emotionally-bonded group, a community, or a nation.  Members may have high emotional investment in the primary person because of family relations, gang affiliation, cultic programming, or similar symptoms to start.  Pathology in the primary individual facilitates transmission: a compulsive drive to “tweet”, a desire to deny reality coupled with propaganda, intolerance of uncertainty leading to pressures of conformity, and an insatiable need for adulation driving addiction-inducing, hypnotic rallies.  These symptoms create the ideal conditions for additional transmission of symptoms.
As symptoms spread, cognitive distortions, delusions, and other manifestations take on an emotional power that are difficult to match with normal responses.  Induced delusions function like primary delusions, wherein resistance is too great for evidence or truth to gain traction.  Those who try to maintain their grounding in reality experience stress, anxiety, ostracism and exhaustion and may eventually submit.  When it originates in disease, it is different from culture but is more aptly called a “cultural disorder.”
3. An environment that fosters contagion
Conditions of isolation, either physically or through filtered information, especially when they “immunize” against alternative viewpoints through phrases such as “fake news” or “the enemy of the people,” combined with constant, high levels of exposure to the symptomatic primary individual, is the formula for shared delusions.  The environment, therefore, is very important.
Many have remarked on the cult-like quality of the leader-follower arrangement we see with the president and his supporters.  The dynamic alarmed my colleagues in the mental health profession enough to write entire volumes.  Existing arrangements of “viral” social media, profit-driven news programs that rely on ratings, and rallies that reinforce herd mentality and conformity, all contribute to the spread of symptoms.
How is the recognition of shared psychosis, or folie à groupe, helpful?  We know from the scientific literature that, when contact with the inducing individual is removed, the shared symptoms usually subside just as dramatically as they have appeared.  If removal is not possible, we know that reducing exposure can be helpful.  We can prevent epidemics from occurring in the first place by screening for mental impairment before individuals take positions of influence.  Further, we can take steps to protect ourselves in the future by promoting public mental health and education about mental disease, as well as reducing environmental “toxins” that include propaganda, brainwashing, and filtered information.  Knowing that mental compromise can contribute to physical demise, and recognizing the distinct, characteristic patterns of disease, we can better avoid mistaking it for a normal choice or just another ideology that excites people.

The DHS paramilitary officers wear camouflage, riot gear, masks, have no name tags or any identifying insignias, and drive in unmarked vans.
They reportedly come from several federal agencies, including the Border Patrol’s BORTAC unit, which are SWAT teams. An internal DHS memo, The New York Times reports, warned they are not trained in crowd control. Their presence has “re-energized” the protests in Portland, which were dwindling down before the feds were deployed.

A tea party darling, Meadows led the U.S. House Freedom Caucus—the crazy wing of the crazy party. Among his greatest hits was voting against Hurricane Sandy relief, leading the charge for the 2013 government shutdown, and providing the catalyst (via a resolution) for Republican House Speaker John Boehner’s resignation in 2015. And he was oh-so-loyal to Donald Trump from day one.
One would think, however, that being a back-bencher in a chamber with 435 seats was different than actually being in charge of staff. One would further think that once put in actual charge would lead one to behave more responsibly. But nope. In Meadows, Trump finally found someone as destructively stupid as he.
Exhibit A: There are lots of reasons Trump has f’d up the national response to the global mass death event wreaking havoc in our country. Turns out, Meadows is a big one. In one corner, you had Trump too afraid to lead, over his head, and stewing that the virus was so unfairly harming his reelection chances. In the other corner, you had ….
Casting the decision in ideological terms, Mr. Meadows would tell people: “Only in Washington, D.C., do they think that they have the answer for all of America.”
Funny. In South Korea, Seoul thought they had the answer for all of South Korea. And they got control of the virus in zero time flat. Same thing in New Zealand, where Wellington squashed the virus through their entire nation. Berlin took over in Germany, and new cases are just a handful of days and schools can safely reopen.
All over the world, federal governments have smartly decided to take control of the national response to a virus that knows no boundaries. It is only in the countries that have royally screwed things up, that states and other municipalities have been left to try and salvage what they can—places like the United States, Brazil, and Russia.
In other words, you have to be a special kind of asshole to think that the most powerful and best-resourced governmental institution should sit out a pandemic raging throughout the country. But, if you remember that Meadows voted against federal aid for disaster-struck Texas and Louisiana, well then, it makes more sense, right?
Exhibit B: This:
Some of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers are adamant that the best way forward is to downplay the dangers of the disease. Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, has been particularly forceful in his view that the White House should avoid drawing attention to the virus, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Mr. Meadows has for the most part opposed any briefings about the virus […]
Guys, don’t draw attention to the virus. No one will notice this thing that is killing a thousand people a day. If we pretend it’s not there, then it disappears!
Gonna stress this again, because those words are so unbelievably stupid that it beggars the mind: Mike Meadows thinks that ignoring the virus will help Trump. He thinks that the thing that is the number one concern of voters will cease being a concern if only the White House pretends it doesn’t exist.
So Meadows’ grand plan is:
1. What virus?
2. Open schools.
3 ….
4. Reelected!
Given that Trump systematically purged his team of any semblance of competence, it’s only fitting the chief of staff he finally settled on is as stupid as he. The only problem is that, with real power, he’s causing real damage to our nation. Something that is, unfortunately, true of every Trump official.

Lumped in with those “traces” are the GOP lawmakers who have enabled the president.
According to John Weaver — who admitted that he helped get former GOP Senator Jeff sessions elected — the group has no plans to disband should Trump go down to defeat in November.
With Sargent writing, “The Lincoln Project’s declared mission is ‘defeating Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box.’ That includes a pledge to elect Democrats over Republicans who, like Trump, do not ‘support the Constitution,’ he went on to point out that the group has been notable for the inclusion of Kellyanne Conway’s husband George, and longtime GOP strategist Rick Wilson known for his hard-hitting attacks on Democrats.
Asked whether “the Lincoln Project is breaking permanently with the GOP embrace of voter suppression, gerrymandering and other anti-democratic tactics,” Weaver said absolutely, adding they are commited to ensuring the “drive-by Jim Crowism in many parts of the country is put to an end.”
Asked about his work for Sessions, Weaver replied, “I have my own atonement to do every day about that. Did I contribute to putting a brick in the road to where we are today? Yeah, I did.”
The political strategist pointed out that the group plans to release get-out-the-vote ads to go with the blunt-talking ads they have already aimed at Trump and GOP senators like Lindsey Graham (SC) and Susan Collins of Maine.
Which brought up what the group plans to do after the election.
Pressed whether the Lincoln Project will run “ads attacking President Biden for raising taxes on oil companies in early 2021,” Weaver said ‘no.’
“We’re not gonna do that,” he explained. ““He [Biden] will have a mandate to clean up the mess that Trump has created with the help of his enablers. That shouldn’t be held up. We intend to do all we can to make sure that doesn’t happen.”
“Indeed, in Weaver’s telling, binding the ‘wounds’ of Trump, as the group’s mission puts it, includes working against Republicans who try to prevent Biden from addressing our deep crises, particularly among Trumpist Republicans such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) who use this to position themselves for 2024,” Sargent wrote, adding that Weaver told him, “
“We will not stand on the sidelines if an attempt to bind the wounds is held up. We plan on participating in that debate.”

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
As hospitals across the United States brace for a difficult six months — with the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic still raging and concerns about a second wave in the fall — some are acutely short-staffed because of an ill-timed change to immigration policy and its inconsistent implementation.
A proclamation issued by President Donald Trump on June 22, barring the entry of most immigrants on work visas, came right as hospitals were expecting a new class of medical residents. Hundreds of young doctors were unable to start their residencies on time.
Trump’s order included the H1-B visa for highly skilled workers, which is used by some practicing doctors abroad who get U.S. residency slots. The proclamation stated that doctors “involved with the provision of medical care to individuals who have contracted COVID-19 and are currently hospitalized” should be exempt from the ban, but it delegated the issuing of guidance to the departments of State and Homeland Security. That guidance has been slow and inconsistent.
Many consulates started approving doctors’ visas on Thursday, after ProPublica asked the State Department about the delay. Others say they’re still awaiting guidance.
At hospitals where many incoming residents are visa holders, even a delay of a few weeks in arriving in the U.S. creates a staffing crisis. Doctors and administrators are afraid that the repercussions will last for the rest of the year — leaving them overworked and ill-prepared even before a second wave of the virus hits.
ProPublica has heard from 10 would-be medical residents stuck abroad because of H1-B visa issues. Six of them had gotten emergency consulate appointments for visa approval, but when they arrived for meetings they were told their visas could not be approved. Three were still waiting on DHS approval for their visas, a necessary step before a visa gets a consulate stamp. One resident had application approval but was denied an emergency consulate interview appointment because of the ban. All were destined for hospital positions treating COVID-19 patients.
The State Department told ProPublica on Tuesday that it, “in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security and interagency partners, is establishing and implementing procedures” for the visa ban, and that it “has communicated and will continue to communicate implementation procedures” to consulates abroad.
On Thursday, the State Department’swebsite posted guidance, spelling out that doctors treating COVID-19 patients were exempt from the ban. On that day, many of the residents ProPublica spoke to said they had suddenly received visa approvals. “A quite remarkable turnaround, given that I received a rejection email three days ago,” one said. In at least five countries, however, consulates were still not processing doctors’ visas.
The Committee of Interns and Residents, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, has heard from over 250 interns stuck abroad. Over 150 of them are on H-1B visas.. (The others are on visas that weren’t covered in Trump’s ban, but can’t get approval because their consulates are still closed due to the pandemic.) Union president Jessica Edwards pointed out to ProPublica that while that number may sound small, each intern is responsible for the care of thousands of patients.
As of 2017, there were 2,532 medical residents on H1-B visas, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association — though the Trump administration’s continued restrictions to legal immigration may have made it less appealing for hospitals to sponsor visas in the last few years. But the impact on hospitals is highly concentrated in the less-prestigious hospitals that tend to rely on residents from overseas.
At one New York City hospital serving low-income residents, nearly half the incoming class is still stuck abroad, multiple sources confirmed to ProPublica. One hospital in a large Midwestern city told ProPublica that “roughly half” of its first-year doctors started on time. In the Deep South, a region now overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases, a doctor who was set to start told ProPublica he was among 10 residents still awaiting visa approval as of early July. All hospitals and doctors spoke to ProPublica on the condition of anonymity because they worried about jeopardizing their visa applications.
ProPublica has also spoken to more-experienced doctors facing the same issue — including an infectious-disease specialist blocked from starting a job in an area of the Western U.S. where COVID-19 cases are rising.
When there aren’t enough incoming residents to replace departing third-year residents, staffing crunches result.
At the New York City hospital, a doctor told ProPublica that after only 10 days of short-staffing, one resident had called in sick from exhaustion. The doctor recounted a recent shift in which there had only been two junior residents on call, compared with the typical six. Even by having residents work individually instead of in teams of two, they couldn’t keep up with new patient admissions.
“The patients had to just stay there waiting in the (emergency department) for the residents to finish their first admission, in order to see them,” the doctor said. “When the shift was over, I logged into the computer and I would see notes written at 10 p.m., 11 p.m. And these residents are expected to go home and then come back again at 6:30 a.m.”
Even at hospitals with decreasing COVID-19 caseloads, short-staffing is a bigger problem than it was in pre-pandemic times. Some hospitals are seeing a “surge of non-COVID patients” who were unable to get care for chronic conditions like heart disease during lockdown and are now deteriorating, a doctor at a short-staffed hospital told ProPublica. And because protocols prevent doctors from switching back and forth between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, the hospital needs to keep more doctors on-call to maintain staffing levels in both wards.
“If someone is getting acutely ill, who will see them?” a hospital administrator told ProPublica. “I’ve got my poor residents running around trying to make sure everyone is seen in a timely manner. And residents are great, but they can only be in one place at one time.”
Some of these problems will be fixed as residents receive delayed visa approvals and are able to come. But it will take weeks, if not months, to successfully onboard them. The Midwestern hospital anticipates that arriving residents may not be able to start until mid-August. In the meantime, they’re understaffing services and using fourth-year medical students in place of residents.
Hospitals are used to a summertime efficiency gap, as new interns learn the ropes. This year, it could persist into fall — when a second wave of coronavirus infections is expected.
“I’m really worried that in three months,” said the medical administrator, “we’re going to have a bunch of residents who are just exhausted and just getting into the worst part of the fall, flu and COVID season.”
These doctors already had to push themselves through the first wave of COVID-19 this spring. Furthermore, at hospitals hardest hit by the visa ban, the residents picking up the slack are often themselves H1-B visa holders whose futures are now uncertain. Trump’s ban didn’t revoke visas for anyone currently in the U.S., but if they leave the country — which they will have to do if they change jobs — their ability to return is unclear. Some of the doctors interviewed by ProPublica were living in the U.S. before the pandemic and returned home partly to get visa approval for their new jobs. One doctor ended up stuck in India while her husband was unable to travel there from the U.S.
Another doctor from India, now working in the U.S., told ProPublica: “My parents, they’re (in India) by themselves, and both of them are about 70. At some point, probably, they will catch the infection.” If that happens, the doctor plans to leave the U.S. to care for them — “and if I don’t come back, I don’t come back. At this point, I really don’t care.”
The feeling that the U.S. doesn’t value them is compounded among residents who’ve already lived through the first wave of COVID-19 and who are now facing overwork and visa uncertainty. Some said other countries are making it easier for doctors to immigrate, while the U.S. leaves them in limbo.
“We feel underappreciated for what we’re doing,” the New York City resident said. “And what else can you do, more than sacrificing your life?”
Tightly regimented residency schedules can be tricky for H1-B visa holders even in the best cases. Doctors find out in mid-March if they are “matched” with a U.S. hospital, where they’ll be expected to start at the beginning of July. DHS often takes longer than that to approve H1-B applications. Employers can pay for expedited processing to guarantee a decision within five days — but DHS shut down its expedited processing on March 22 because of COVID-19 and didn’t reopen it until June 8.
Shortly afterward, Trump issued his proclamation banning entries on many visa types, including the H1-B.
Most people coming to the U.S. for residencies arrive on a different kind of visa, the J-1, and aren’t covered by Trump’s ban, though some have had issues getting consulate appointments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But doctors do identical work regardless of their visa types. If anything, doctors with H1-Bs are more qualified than those with J-1s, since they’re required to have completed all three phases of the taxing U.S. Medical Licensing Exam before starting residencies. Residents with H1-B visas were practicing doctors in their home countries, working alongside new medical-school grads from the U.S.
An earlier immigration ban targeting permanent immigrants, which passed in March, contained a broad medical worker exemption. When rumors of a work-visa ban started swirling in late spring, immigration lawyers and hospitals expected it would include the same language. Instead, the June proclamation mentioned only doctors working with hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Every resident who spoke with ProPublica had provided evidence to the U.S. government that they met that description. Some were told by consular officers that they were probably exempt. But until they received State Department guidance, they had to place their visas in “administrative processing” — an indefinite holding pattern.
ProPublica saw an image of a form given to one visa applicant informing them of a hold. The form is typically used to request more information from the applicant. In this case, though, a consular officer had modified the form to say that processing would not begin until “implementation procedures” for the visa-ban exemption had been provided.
Doctors in limbo have formed WhatsApp groups to share information and support, but the dialogue has shown inconsistencies in the ban’s implementation. Some consulates, such as those in Serbia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, have approved doctors’ H1-B visas as exempt. Asked about the discrepancy, the State Department told ProPublica: “Applicants who believe they qualify for an exemption from Presidential Proclamation 10052 should check the website of the closest U.S. Embassy or Consulate regarding the current status of services. How appointment systems are managed can vary depending on the consular section.”
One applicant who reached out to the State Department for assistance received an email reply from an employee on July 10. The employee said that as far as they knew, the Office for Consular Affairs had given guidance to consulates and embassies to process visas that were exempt from the ban. (The agency declined to comment on that email.)
On Thursday, that applicant received a second email from the same employee. Guidance had been slow in coming, the employee admitted, but it had finally come through.
But some countries still haven’t changed their practices. One doctor stuck abroad told ProPublica they’d sent a follow-up email to the consulate on Thursday morning. “He gave me the same reply,” the doctor said, “that they are still waiting for guidance from Department of State.”

Charlie Baker and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. And while President Donald Trump is the Republican who is criticized the most when it comes to coronavirus, journalist Jonathan Chait, but in a lengthy essay published in New York Magazine on July 20, stresses that Trump is hardly alone when it comes to handling the crisis badly. As Chait sees it, the United States’ COVID-19 death count is an indictment of the GOP in general and underscores its “anti-science” tendencies.
The U.S., Chait writes, is “a viral petri dish of uncontained infection. By June — after most of the world had beaten back the coronavirus pandemic — the U.S., with 4% of the world’s population, accounted for 25% of its cases. Florida alone was seeing more new infections a week than China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia and the European Union combined…. The United States is now the sick man of the world, pitied by the same countries that once envied its pandemic preparedness — and, as recently as the 2014 Ebola outbreak, relied on its expertise to organize the global response.”
Anti-science attitudes, Chait laments, were plaguing the GOP long before Trump was sworn into office in January 2017.
“The distrust and open dismissal of expertise and authority may seem uniquely contemporary — a phenomenon of the Trump era, or the rise of online misinformation,” Chait explains. “But the president and his party are the products of a decades-long war against the functioning of good government, a collapse of trust in experts and empiricism, and the spread of a kind of magical thinking that flourishes in a hothouse atmosphere that can seal out reality. While it’s not exactly shocking to see a Republican administration be destroyed by incompetent management — it happened to the last one, after all — the willfulness of it is still mind-boggling and has led to the unnecessary sickness and death of hundreds of thousands of people and the torpedoing of the reelection prospects of the president himself.”
Chait emphasizes that Republicans weren’t always anti-science, noting that the Environment Protection Agency was created under President Richard Nixon. But more and more, Chait writes, a disdain for science has plagued the GOP in recent years — and that anti-science attitude makes its presence felt whenever Republicans rail against Dr. Anthony Fauci (who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task for) or refuse to wear face masks in public.
“The truly remarkable thing about the right-wing revolt against public health is that it has taken place under a president whom conservatives trust and adore,” Chait writes. “From the standpoint of running the government, these have been awful conditions for handling a pandemic. But from the standpoint of persuading citizens to cooperate, they have been almost optimal. When we look back a year from now at the frenzied, angry revolt against science, the spring and summer of 2020 may seem like halcyon days.”

Bush administration.
“The fun part is that Yoo frames this as ‘making it easy for presidents to break the law,'” tweeted journalist David Dayen “and Trump jumps on it and says ‘yes let’s do that.'”
of course john yoo would show up in all of his moral and intellectual bankrupcy https://t.co/JwrnjzRwPG
— b-boy bouiebaisse (@jbouie) July 20, 2020
According to Axios, which broke the news of the new White House strategy Sunday evening, the president is relying on a legal argument in an article Yoo wrote in June for the National Review after the Supreme Court’s Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California ruling.
The court upheld former President Barack Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Trump had attempted to repeal without setting up a new regulatory framework to replace it. Therefore, Yoo argued, the court ruled that the White House can use its own discretion on enforcing the law to effectively set policy.
As Yoo wrote:
Suppose President Donald Trump decided to create a nationwide right to carry guns openly. He could declare that he would not enforce federal firearms laws, and that a new “Trump permit” would free any holder of state and local gun-control restrictions.
  Even if Trump knew that his scheme lacked legal authority, he could get away with it for the length of his presidency. And, moreover, even if courts declared the permit illegal, his successor would have to keep enforcing the program for another year or two.
While Axios editor Sam Baker noted that the interpretation was “a somewhat strained reading of both procedural history and the law,” the White House appears to be taking it seriously. The president has referred to the Yoo article in conversations with administration officials, according to Axios, and hinted in an interview Sunday with Fox News‘ Christopher Wallace that executive action on healthcare and immigration is coming soon.
“The Supreme Court gave the president of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had, by approving, by doing what they did—their decision on DACA,” said Trump, adding that in his view, “the decision by the Supreme Court on DACA allows me to do things on immigration, on health care, on other things that we’ve never done before.”
Critics noted the reappearance of Yoo in making the case for expanded presidential powers and expressed regret that Obama, upon taking office in 2009, did not take action to hold the Bush administration accountable for its crimes.
“The reappearance of disgracefully still-employable torture advocate John Yoo is a good reminder that this time people need to be prosecuted,” tweeted Matt Duss, foreign policy advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
“John Yoo is a psychopath” and “George Bush was at least respectful of democratic norms” are inconsistent.
— Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) July 20, 2020
The involvement of Yoo in the president’s latest scheme to avoid Congress, Georgetown professor Don Moynihan said on Twitter, is a reminder that the current president is not so out of step with his Republican predecessor.
“The centrality of John Yoo, and his message that SCOTUS ‘makes it easy for presidents to violate the law,’ reminds us that there is a lot of continuity between the Bush and Trump administration, including an almost limitless view of executive power,” said Moynihan.

Ron Wyden of Oregon has described the agents as President Donald “Trump’s secret police.” Much of the criticism of the agents has come from liberal and progressive website, but some conservative outlets are troubled as well, including The Bulwark. And in an article published in The Bulwark on July 20, Carrie Cordero — an intel/security specialist and former attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice — explains why having a “purely domestic security service” in the United States is a terrible idea.
“This past week, (Department of Homeland Security) personnel, including officers of the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), were deployed by the acting secretary of Homeland Security to conduct domestic law enforcement activities in Portland,” Cordero notes. “But policing protest activity, in particular, requires a special sensitivity to and protection of constitutional rights. And the reports out of Portland indicate that DHS has provided an uncontrolled and over-militarized response. Moreover, these assignments of federal officers to control domestic unrest may be part of a broader slide toward a federal domestic security expansion that has neither been announced nor vetted either by the citizenry, the Congress, or the courts.”
Cordero, now a legal/security analyst for CNN and an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., goes on to explain that in May, she offered a report “arguing that DHS requires immediate congressional attention to improve its internal oversight and accountability mechanisms…. The extent to which DHS is becoming almost a rogue arm of federal law enforcement should not surprise anyone who has followed the department for the last four years.”
A peaceful protester in Portland was shot in the head by one of Donald Trump’s secret police. Now Trump and Chad Wolf are weaponizing the DHS as their own occupying army to provoke violence on the streets of my hometown because they think it plays well with right-wing media.
— Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) July 16, 2020
Cordero’s concerns, she writes, include agents for the Drug Enforcement Agency “conducting physical surveillance without identifying themselves, using technical surveillance techniques over crowds of individuals without suspicion of wrongdoing, and otherwise collecting intelligence — covertly — on individuals purposefully exercising their First Amendment rights. And this sort of clandestine activity clearly crosses the line into domestic security activities.”
The former DOJ attorney adds, “Most law enforcement activities do not require covert activity. And when undercover activities are needed, they are performed according to strict rules and procedures and approvals. These approvals are given on a case-by-case basis. In the normal course of events, law enforcement activity is conducted openly: agents identify themselves when they conduct interviews, execute searches, or make arrests. Why should law enforcement need to use covert means to protect public safety in the context of public protests?”
Cordero concludes her article by stressing that federal law enforcement must operate out in the open and that there should be no place for secret police in the U.S.
“The reason to not have a domestic security service is rooted in aversion to creating anything that might have the potential to morph into a Stasi-like organization,” Cordero writes. “Because a domestic security service is incongruous with the exercise of constitutional rights.”

Appearing on CNN Monday, CNN medical analyst Dr. Rochelle Walensky said that no countries around the world are looking enviously at America at the moment.
“I think we’re in deep trouble,” Walensky said. “Certainly, we’re not permitted to travel in many places around the world. I’ve gotten e-mails from many other places around the world asking if there’s anything people can do to help. I don’t think we’re the envy of the world in terms of COVID right now.”
Walensky also knocked Trump for saying that wearing masks can “cause problems” for people.
“I think as you look at the big picture, I mean, there are a lot of things that cause problems,” she said. “The biggest problem right now is we have hundreds of people, thousands of people dying every day. Thousands and thousands of people, tens of thousands of people, being hospitalized for COVID, and I think when you look at the big picture of the problems that masks cause versus the problems that COVID causes, COVID is winning a lot.”

Maxine Waters of California has been speaking out about criminal justice for decades, going back to her years in the California State Assembly. Waters, now 81, has continued to speak out following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 — and the congresswoman made her presence felt over the weekend when she stopped her SUV and got out after seeing a black man who had been pulled over by Los Angeles Police Department officers.
Another observer was using a cell phone to film the incident, and a video shows Waters saying, “They stopped a brother. So, I stopped to see what they (the LAPD) were doing.”

0,2020-07-20T15:17:04+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/dr-deborah-birx-seemed-like-a-reasonable-voice-close-to-the-throne-now-shes-destroyed-herself-and-for-what/,Dr. Deborah Birx seemed like a reasonable voice close to the throne. Now she’s destroyed herself — and for what?,"Over the past week or so, there’s been a major attempt by the Trump administration to demean the reputation of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, with anonymous “oppo-research” and open insults from Peter Navarro, a trade adviser close to President Trump. Fauci is widely acknowledged to be one of the world’s foremost experts on pandemics so there was a furious pushback to this crude character assassination. Despite the fact that Trump had made similar remarks about Fauci being “wrong” about the coronavirus, the president was forced to throw Navarro under the bus despite the fact that it’s obvious they’ve been on the same page.
Trump is obviously jealous of the public’s trust in Fauci, compared to the increasing public skepticism of anything he personally says about the crisis. But this attack on Fauci is really just a symbol of the administration’s rejection of the reality we can see with our own eyes: a new explosion of COVID-19 all over the country.
It was an ugly kerfuffle but certainly not something that should have surprised us. Trump has been insulting and purging any government employee he deems disloyal, and since Fauci isn’t blowing smoke about the virus, that’s how Trump sees him.
Over the weekend Trump gave an interview to Fox News’ Chris Wallace and made a fool of himself trying to deny this reality. He insisted, as he always does, that the virus is not spreading and the rising number of cases is entirely due to expanded testing, which is complete nonsense.
According to the New York Times fact check:
The United States has the eighth-worst fatality rate among reported coronavirus cases in the world, and the death rate per 100,000 people — 42.83 — ranks it third-worst, according to data on the countries most affected by the coronavirus compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
That was far from the only false information Trump shared on the pandemic. And it raises the question: where does he get this stuff? As you can see by that clip above, he had White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany standing by with papers that had headings on them saying things like “The United States has the lowest mortality rate in the world” but that doesn’t mean anything. While it’s possible that Trump just heard this from one of the voices in his head, we don’t need to go there right now.
Well, the Times did another one of those deep dives into how the White House handled the pandemic, which offers up some new information about that question. This time the reporting team looked specifically at the month of April, when the administration made a dramatic shift in strategy to shovel all responsibility for the pandemic response onto the states. That article suggests that if you want to point the finger at one member of the White House coronavirus task force who has consistently fed optimistic projections and questionable data points to the president, it’s Dr. Deborah Birx.
It turns out that many of the most important decisions that were made during that period weren’t done by the official task force headed by Vice President Mike Pence, but by another shadowy group that met every weekday morning in White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’ office. (Remember, Jared Kushner was also running his own task force on a secret, separate track.)
This one was single-mindedly dedicated to producing evidence to back up the White House decision to open up the economy, come what may. Dr. Birx was their validator, the only public health official among the group of political hands, and the Times describes her as “the chief evangelist in the West Wing for the idea that infections had peaked and the virus was fading quickly.”
During the morning meetings in Mr. Meadows’s office, Dr. Birx almost always delivered what the new team was hoping for: “All metros are stabilizing,” she would tell them, describing the virus as having hit its “peak” around mid-April. The New York area accounted for half of the total cases in the country, she said. The slope was heading in the right direction. “We’re behind the worst of it.”
During much of mid-April, Dr. Birx focused intensely on the experience that Italy had fighting the virus. In her view, it was a particularly positive comparison, telling colleagues that the United States was on the same trajectory as Italy, where there were huge spikes before infections and deaths flattened to close to zero.
Dr. Birx would roam the halls of the White House, sometimes passing out diagrams to bolster her case. “We’ve hit our peak,” she would say, and that message would find its way back to Mr. Trump.
Unlike Fauci, she had an office in the West Wing and fully embraced “her role as a member of the president’s team.” I think we know what that means.
Birx relied on an optimistic model that depended on everyone doing everything exactly right, while Fauci had a more realistic view of probable human behavior and listened to reports on the ground as well as the statistical data. As things got worse, Birx’s rosy scenarios were chosen over Fauci’s darker predictions. Trump didn’t want to hear bad news and Birx was there to give him what he needed.
She still is. Apparently, she remains the go-to for the White House communications team whenever they need some damage control. McEnany was asked the other day how she could claim that everything was well in hand when hospitalizations were going up rapidly. She replied, “I spoke with Dr. Birx this morning — about 10 to 40 percent in the hospitals reaching high capacity are COVID, so a lot of hospitalizations aren’t pertaining to COVID.” (The word on Sunday was that some hospitals in Florida’s Miami-Dade County had run out of available ICU beds. That was not the result of elective surgeries. )
Fauci describes Birx, whom he considers a friend for decades, as more political than him, a “different species.” Indeed she is. In fact she often sounds like Kellyanne Conway or McEnany:
When Birx first came on the scene at the beginning of the pandemic, I wrote about the fact that she was part of a Christian right public health subculture (yes, that actually exists) that surrounds Mike Pence’s office. I don’t think I expected that she’d be willing to sacrifice her reputation as a serious infectious disease expert for the thrill of being on Trump’s “team.” Apparently she has.
Whether Birx’s upbeat scenarios were passed on to the president and his enablers because she truly believed them or because she wanted to be a team player is an interesting question. It doesn’t much matter in reality, because the result has been a disaster. Like so many others who came into Trump’s orbit, she threw her respectable career on the fire to please a president who so far over his head that he’s pretty much buried himself and taken her down with him. Tragically, they’ve both overseen policies that have buried more than 140,000 Americans in the last five months as well.

Wallace wasn’t shy about asking tough questions during the interview, which aired on July 19. And conservative journalist Jennifer Rubin, in her Washington Post column, points to Trump’s performance as proof that he is his “own worst enemy.”
“It’s hard to pick the most damning part of Chris Wallace’s interview with President Trump on Fox News,” Rubin writes. But Trump’s comments on the coronavirus pandemic and the Confederate flag, the Never Trump columnist stresses, were especially embarrassing.
“Trump’s dismissive attitude that he’ll eventually be proved right on COVID-19’s disappearance — after nearly 140,000 deaths? — reminds us that he is indifferent to human suffering and incapable of acknowledging error,” Rubin argues. “In that same vein — with coronavirus hospitalizations rising — he callously insisted some cases are nothing but the sniffles. Tell that to about 140,000 families.”
Rubin adds, “In the empathy department, Trump still cannot acknowledge that the Confederate battle flag does not merely ‘represent the South,’ but the traitorous white nationalists who took up arms against the United States.”
Watching the interview with Wallace, Rubin writes, it is painfully obvious that “Trump remains his own worst enemy, providing endless fodder for his critics.” And those critics, according to Rubin, range from former Vice President Joe Biden to the Never Trump conservatives of The Lincoln Project — which has come out with one scathing anti-Trump ad after another.
Rubin wraps up her column by warning that when the time comes for presidential debates, “Biden may have trouble getting Trump to agree to any legitimate moderator.”
“Trump despises CNN,” Rubin explains. “Fox News has lost its charm for Trump, and Wallace — in all likelihood  —  wouldn’t get a second chance to humiliate him. It is possible Trump’s aides might persuade him not to participate: e.g., lying to him that he’s ahead and therefore, shouldn’t help Biden ‘catch up.’ However, if Trump does agree to moderators not thoroughly in his camp, the results may be spectacularly awful if Biden and the moderators both expend effort fact-checking him — or the networks insist on fact-checking him in real time.”

But financial writer Adam Davidson, in a Twitter thread, stresses that the president greatly exaggerates how wealthy he is and uses some figures to make his case.
Davidson, author of the book “The Passion Economy: The New Rules for Thriving in the 21st Century,” tweets, “Hot take: Trump is demonstrably far poorer than he claims. Again: Scotland holds the key.”Davidson goes on to explain why Trump’s business interests in the U.K. offer some insights on his true net worth. According to Davidson, Trump’s “audited UK financials show money-losing properties with arbitrarily inflated values with no tie to actual market conditions. Those are his ONLY audited financials.”

Davidson goes into specifics, writing, “So, three businesses that lose around 5 million pounds a year and have a collective value of, say, 70M pounds (being generous) are claimed to bring in 150 million pounds a year! And, again, those are his MOST trustworthy numbers.”

Davidson estimates that Trump now has about $50 million less than the amount he inherited from his father, the late Fred Trump, Sr.
“My best guess: he got around $200M from dad and now has $150M or so, because he’s bad at money and takes bad risks,” Davidson writes.
According to Davidson, “There are huge error bars around every number related to Trump. We have no idea how much his businesses make, how many assets he owns, and how much debt he has. There is a good chance he, himself, has no idea. Because he has a small and inept finance team.”
All of his other financial claims have no constraint at all. They’re just made up with no oversight.

I do think there is fairly strong evidence that he, also, makes money by helping oligarchs launder money.
BUT, he seems to also be bad at that. He makes dumb deals that involve too much risk and too little return.

Davidson notes, however, that Trump’s hardcore supporters don’t become any less supportive when he argues that the president isn’t as wealthy as he claims to be.
“When I’ve tried this logic on Trump supporters,” Davidson tweets, “it doesn’t work of course. They are then even MORE impressed with his hustle. A broke guy has a big plane? Cool!”

With the Senate currently on recess and not expected to return until July 20, McConnell told reporters Monday that he doesn’t plan to begin formal stimulus talks with his Democratic counterparts until next week at the earliest. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reportedly told his caucus Tuesday that he has not heard from McConnell regarding Covid-19 negotiations.
McConnell’s timeline for the talks would leave the Senate and House with less than a week to hash out and pass legislation before unemployment benefits begin reverting to their pre-pandemic rate, which in some states maxes out at less than $300 per week.
“Mitch McConnell may already have doomed the tens of millions of American workers who depend on enhanced federal unemployment benefits to a sudden, sharp decline in income at the end of July,” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said in a statement late Tuesday.
“Because state unemployment benefits need to be extended by July 25 in order to be processed by states administering their programs, McConnell’s announcement that the Senate will not even begin drafting or negotiating legislation until next week effectively makes a lapse in those expanded payments unavoidable,” Beyer added. “We may already be out of time to avoid the iceberg.”
xx
Economists have repeatedly warned that allowing the enhanced unemployment benefits to expire at the end of July would slash the incomes of more than 30 million Americans by 50-75%. According to Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute, such a steep income cut could also cause massive job losses and a decline in economic growth.
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of the architects of the boosted unemployment insurance, tweeted Wednesday that “30 million Americans will be left in the lurch without this critical lifeline.”
“It’s time for the Trump administration and Senate Republicans to get their act together and extend supercharged unemployment benefits,” said Wyden. “Our whole economy depends on it.”
The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill in May that would extend the $600 weekly unemployment insurance boost through January of next year, but McConnell has refused to allow a vote on the legislation.
After previously opposing any extension of the enhanced unemployment insurance, Trump administration officials in recent days have signaled openness to approving smaller weekly payments.
“Despite some new consensus that the additional $600 in federal unemployment benefits shouldn’t disappear entirely, Republicans and Democrats are still far apart on an actual deal,” HuffPost reported Wednesday. “Republicans are looking at a number closer to $200, and Democrats are pushing for benefits closer to $500.”
Though the program got off to a rough start as an unprecedented flood of unemployment applications created massive backlogs and delays, the enhanced benefits have been lauded by progressives as on the whole one of the most successful components of the federal government’s Covid-19 response.
Supporters of the program argue it would be catastrophic to let the benefits to expire as coronavirus infections surge across the U.S., thousands of workers are laid off for a second time as states roll back their reopenings, and tens of millions of Americans face possible eviction.
“This is the real fiscal cliff,” tweeted Bharat Ramamurti, a member of the congressional committee tasked with overseeing the Trump administration’s handling of Covid-19 funds.
In less than two weeks, Ramamurti said, “30+ million will experience huge cuts in income—a shock that will force such an enormous drop in consumer spending that it will cause 3 million further job losses.”
George Wentworth, senior counsel at the National Employment Law Project, told The American Prospect Monday that “with the virus still not under control and more states reinstating Covid-related restrictions on many sectors of the economy, health and economic conditions are still far too volatile to end this supplement.”
“Now is not the time to pull the rug out from under workers who are not able to return to work because of the damage done by the pandemic,” said Wentworth.

0,2020-07-20T13:48:52+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/americas-president-is-trapped-in-the-fox-news-universe/,America’s president is trapped in the Fox News Universe,"Donald Trump is a Fox News grandpa. He watches the TV and it tells him what to do.
Trump is not special or unique in that regard. As Jen Senko showed in her compelling documentary “The Brainwashing of My Dad,” there are tens of millions of mostly older white people who live in the deranged alternate reality created by Fox News (and the broader right-wing echo chamber).
But Donald Trump has a terrible power and titanic responsibilities that the other lost souls in the Fox News Universe do not: He is president of the United States of America. In that way Donald Trump is unique in his ability to follow the horrible commands given to him by Fox News and then inflict them on the American people.
During his one-person White House Rose Garden campaign rally last Tuesday, Donald Trump continued his public downward spiral of mental decompensation as he spouted more lies and conspiracy theories, made vicious attacks on Joe Biden and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, engaged in more self-aggrandizement, undermined the country’s public health with his lies about the coronavirus, claimed that Biden and the Democrats want to destroy “the suburbs,” and overall behaved as though he was auditioning for the role of Mad King in a made for TV movie.
Writing at The Bulwark, Charles Sykes described the scene:
The president of the United States, ladies and gentlemen, was in full Mad King mode, rambling, confused, disjointed, parading his grievances with barely a wave from afar at coherence. It was as if a hive of buzzwords exploded in his head: statues, boats, vandalism, socialism, suburbs.
  It is hard to write about this display without using the word “impaired.” Because it wasn’t just the disjointed word salad. It was the delivery. Trump was somnolent, as if he’d pulled an all-nighter watching Fox & Friends or maybe his VCR tapes of Shark Week.
  Imagine the covfefe tweet come to life.
  The Rose Garden event was ostensibly about China, but quickly disintegrated into something between one of his improvisational stump performances, a stream of broken consciousness, and a rambling oppo dump. Perhaps the president really misses campaign rallies. Or maybe he just got confused.
  Someone on his staff gave him a summary of horrible things that he might someday be able to craft into a campaign attack on Joe Biden . . . and so he just stood there and read the whole thing.
Trump did not pull words and ideas out of the ether during his Rose Garden “press conference.”
He was reciting talking points from Fox News and other elements of the right-wing disinformation machine.
For those rational people who do not live in that echo chamber, Trump’s Rose Garden “press conference” was all conspiratorial madness, lies and assorted right-wing pablum. But for those people who live in the Fox News Universe what Trump said was verifiable fact and a type of special privileged knowledge only available to people like them.
On Wednesday, Trump again showed the power that Fox News has over his mind. Like a broken computer in a movie, spitting out the same information over and over again, Trump declared:
Joe Biden and the Radical Left want to Abolish Police, Abolish ICE, Abolish Bail, Abolish Suburbs, Abolish the 2nd Amendment – and Abolish the American Way of Life. No one will be SAFE in Joe Biden’s America!
Donald Trump continues to behave like the equivalent of a drunken, Fox News-addicted bigot at the hotel bar. He is Archie Bunker, with more money and less decency. Unlike his close adviser Stephen Miller, an overt white supremacist, Trump has no political ideology. Fox News, however, does. It is the country’s largest and most successful white supremacist propaganda machine, if not the world’s. Fox News can make that vile vision become reality through its symbiotic relationship with Donald Trump and his Republican Party.
While Trump’s Rose Garden “press conference” was despicable, the president’s interview with CBS News on the same day revealed even more how Fox News has provided him with a narrative framework for his racism and white supremacy.
When asked by CBS News’ Catherine Herridge about police thuggery and brutality against black people, Trump exclaimed, “So are white people. So are white people. What a terrible question to ask. So are white people. More white people, by the way. More white people.”
Because he wants to be a 21st-century version of Jefferson Davis, Trump defended the Confederate flag and tried to suggest it was somehow equivalent to the Black Lives Matter movement.
He told CBS that, “I know people that like the Confederate flag, and they’re not thinking about slavery. I look at NASCAR. You go to NASCAR. You had those flags all over the place. They stopped it. I just think it’s freedom of speech, whether it’s Confederate flags or Black Lives Matter or anything else you want to talk about. It’s freedom of speech.” When asked about slavery and the pain that the Confederate flag causes Black people (and other people of conscience) Trump replied, “People love it.”
In Trump’s mind and the collective mind of the Fox News Universe, Black people who do not want to be treated as second-class citizens in America are the moral equivalent of white supremacist terrorists, murderers, rapists, torturers, enslavers and other evildoers.
The claims Trump has made recently do not require great skill in semiotics and sociolinguistics to decode and rebut.
Social scientists and other researchers have repeatedly shown that America’s police are more likely to use lethal or brutal force against unarmed Black people than against white people. Police are also much more likely to escalate their levels of violence against Black and brown people than against white people.
Of note: In 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump retweeted white supremacist propaganda about “black crime” against white people.
The Confederate flag is not just a matter of “free speech.” It is a symbol of white supremacy and a cause dedicated to enslaving, murdering, abusing, torturing and otherwise denying the human rights of black people. Political scientists have shown that support for the Confederate flag is highly correlated with anti-black animus and racial resentment.
While many white Americans — at least in these weeks of the George Floyd protests — are showing a positive change in their racial attitudes and feelings towards Black Americans and other nonwhites, Donald Trump and his regime have instead chosen fanatical loyalty to their white supremacist counterrevolution against multiracial America.
What are Donald Trump and his followers and allies fighting so desperately to defend?
In her book “White Identity Politics,” political scientist Ashley Jardina offers this answer:
For a number of whites, these monumental social and political trends — including an erosion of whites’ majority status and the election of America’s first black president — have signaled a challenge to the absoluteness of whites’ dominance. These threats, both real and perceived, have … brought to the fore, for many whites, a sense of commonality, attachment, and solidarity with their racial group. They have led a sizeable proportion of whites to believe that their racial group, and the benefits that group enjoys, are endangered. As a result, this racial solidarity now plays a central role in the way many whites orient themselves to the political and social world.
Fox News is one of the main redoubts for this white supremacist counterrevolution. In that role, Fox News takes explicit white supremacy from fringe voices in American society (and around the world) and repackages it for “mainstream” consumption. This process is known as “narrative laundering.” Fox News host Tucker Carlson and his staff are experts at it.
On his prime-time show, Carlson routinely repeats white supremacist talking points about nonwhite “invaders” in America, or about how white people are being “replaced,” nonwhite immigrants are disease carriers, “diversity” is dangerous, white supremacy is a “myth” and the Black Lives Matter movement is “coming for” white people, among other lies.
During his Rose Garden one-man rally last Tuesday, Donald Trump repeated, almost verbatim, Carlson’s falsehoods about the Democrats wanting to “abolish” the suburbs.
Carlson’s head writer was forced to resign last week after his white supremacist threats against Black people, Jews and other ethnic and racial minorities were recently discovered on an online forum. Carlson’s head writer also targeted women and gay people with his hatred.
Such comments routinely appear on Carlson’s show, to be sure, but laundered to be slightly more “polite.” Predictably, last Monday Tucker Carlson announced that he would be taking a “long-scheduled vacation,” effective immediately.
In all, America’s democracy and political culture are imperiled by both Fox News as well as Donald Trump’s relationship to it. When the television talks to Donald Trump it is telling him to do horrible things — and he slavishly follows the commands.
Writing at the Guardian, Bobby Lewis describes how Fox News poisons its viewers, and the United States as a whole:
Fox News is ridiculous, stupid, and — when it doesn’t mean to be — hilarious. Most importantly, it’s an extremely influential stream of conservative misinformation. And the president’s favorite show, Fox & Friends, encapsulates the totality of the rotten network’s inherent conflicts and contradictions.
It shows how news and opinion is blurred — but opinion wins — and the lengths the network goes to ensure a devoted audience. Fox is a shameless counterfeit of a news organization, and Fox & Friends leads the fraud bright and early every morning.
People who begin watching Fox News “with an open mind,” Lewis continues, “can find themselves sucked into a destructive and alienating lifestyle.” He details the examples collected by the writer Luke O’Neil, “of families, his own included, divided by Fox News’ partisan garbage fire.” One family spoke of no longer sending their children to see their grandparents because “their toxic anger and resentment is slowly becoming their entire identity.”
I can tell you from personal experience that when I say Fox poisons minds, I’m not being that hyperbolic. While watching Fox & Friends every morning, I struggle to unearth or at least assemble even shadows of fact-based arguments from the unhinged nonsense that is vital to the brand.
  It can be so intense on Fox & Friends that I sometimes have what could be called propaganda hangovers – after finishing the show, I feel as though I’m trapped in a fog of disinformation, and my mental processes feel sluggish for a few more minutes.
As he has repeatedly demonstrated to America and the world, Donald Trump, the corner bar drunk and Archie Bunker bigot, is a prisoner of the Fox News worldview. This would almost be comical if Trump were not president of the United States in a time of plague and economic disaster, for which he is largely responsible. Families of those who have died or been rendered destitute are not laughing. America is now a pitiful nation led by a pathetic Mad King who will apparently do anything to stay in power.

— The Recount (@therecount) July 20, 2020
Saying he’s concerned Americans are “letting the politics and the policy get in the way,” Vice Admiral Jerome Adams says if President Trump were to require face coverings be worn, it would have to be enforced.
“You all were talking earlier about what’s going on in Portland, and the debate over whether or not to bring in federal troops to other parts of the United States,” Adams said, referring to the Dept. of Homeland Security sending in federal SWAT teams and abducting random demonstrators from the streets in Oregon.
“If you’re going to have a federal mandate you have to have a federal enforcement mechanism,” Adams said, suggesting that “mechanism” would be federal SWAT teams, which is false. Federal law and policy are enforced every day without having to send in SWAT teams. In fact, the Oregon Attorney General is suing the Dept. of Homeland Security over its occupation.
Adams added he would rather have state and local officials mandate masks than the federal government, and convince Americans why it’s important to wear them, instead of “sending in federal troops.”
Watch:
On Fox & Friends, the Surgeon General advocates for mask wearing but stops short of calling for a federal mandate, because that would require a “federal enforcement mechanism” that could look like Portland, OR. pic.twitter.com/ktGHa6RmOf

“I wanted to let you know that the executive team with Polaris is meeting with Chairman Peterson this afternoon,” he wrote to Haley Dorval, an assistant to the chief of staff at the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. “It would be greatly helpful if I could talk to someone by early afternoon about the status of this issue.”
Durand’s boss had pressured USTR all year about tariffs that were costing the company millions of dollars every month. Polaris, which imports parts for its off-road vehicles and motor boats, was working every Washington angle to win tariff exemptions. An administration-backed trade bill, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, was coming up for a vote and Polaris CEO Scott Wine told investors last summer that he was “trying to leverage votes for USMCA to help us get tariff relief.”
Durand alluded to the pressure on his boss, the powerful Democratic chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, in his email to Dorval.
“We continue to have community leaders ask why the Chairman is supporting USMCA given the outstanding trade issues in the district,” Durand wrote in the email, which was among the hundreds of congressional entreaties to USTR obtained by ProPublica under the Freedom of Information Act. Peterson’s office did not reply to requests for further comment.
Polaris’ campaign worked. A year later, more than two-thirds of the 110 exclusion requests Polaris sought in a round of 25% tariffs have been granted, compared with 5% of requests overall. In a later round of 7.5% tariffs, most of Polaris’ 54 requests are still pending, but the handful of decisions made so far have been favorable. That means it will get back a substantial amount of the $90 million it paid in tariffs in 2019, according to the company, which employs 9,000 people in the U.S.
“Members of Congress championed relief from these tariffs to help protect these jobs for Polaris and for our employees who live in their states and districts,” Polaris spokeswoman Jess Rogers said in a statement. “We are grateful to the President and his Administration for being responsive and helping to protect American jobs and Polaris continues to aggressively re-source parts of its China supply chain.”
Polaris’ campaign illustrates the lengths to which companies have gone to mitigate the impact of hefty tariffs, which have in many circumstances affected their bottom lines more than any other business factor.
Even after the Phase 1 trade deal with China signed in January, bringing a cease-fire to the escalating tit-for-tat tariff war between the two countries, duties remain on about $330 billion worth of imports from China. A steady trickle of exemptions, however, has relieved the burden on some lucky companies. Since the tariffs took effect in 2018, dozens of USTR reviewers have evaluated more than 52,000 requests for relief — hundreds of which have been boosted by personal outreach from lawmakers.
According to USTR data, in 2018 and 2019 the agency received 607 letters from senators and representatives on behalf of companies asking for clemency, accompanied by an untold number of phone calls, emails and personal meetings.
In general, this type of back-channel policymaking helps lawmakers to do constituents’ bidding while leaving few tracks. University of California, Riverside, political science professor Melinda Ritchie is studying Hill intervention in trade policy after her earlier work on congressional influence on appeals for trade adjustment assistance at the Department of Labor.
“When members of Congress contact agencies, they try to keep those members happy, regardless of who they are,” Ritchie said.
The most prolific member in the USTR emails was Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, an outspoken administration critic on trade, who sent 35 letters asking USTR to grant exclusion requests for specific companies. Most of them, like fan maker Lasko Products and the chemical manufacturer Arkema Inc., are either based or have significant operations in Pennsylvania.
It’s common to find campaign donations from companies that receive congressional help, although contributions are not necessarily linked. Twelve lawmakers, for example, contacted USTR supporting Home Depot. Ten of them — all but Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath and Sen. Johnny Isakson, who retired in 2019 — received campaign donations of $10,000 in either the 2018 or 2020 cycles or both.
Last October, Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada requested an in-office briefing from USTR to advocate for exclusions for IGT Global Solutions, a gaming technology manufacturer. A few months later, he received a $5,000 donation. The CEO of a New Jersey company called Snow Joe has been a frequent giver to both Trump and Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who last September wrote a letter supporting exclusions for Snow Joe’s electric pressure washers.
Polaris has been ramping up its political giving in recent years, and has already been a generous donor this cycle. Its employee PAC has so far parceled out $244,000, while CEO Wine has contributed an additional $60,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee.
Meanwhile, he also gave the maximum individual contribution of $2,800 to the presidential campaign of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, who in October 2018 called Lighthizer about Polaris’ exclusion requests. Minnesota’s other senator, Tina Smith, received $5,000 from Polaris’ PAC and made at least two phone calls to Lighthizer on Polaris’ behalf in 2019. Neither Senators’ offices responded to a request for comment.
Other lawmakers on Polaris’ team included Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, whose staffer emailed USTR in August 2019. “Many of his constituents use their products in rural Eastern and Southeastern Ohio on a daily basis, and as a U.S. company that has invested in Ohio, he wanted to convey his support for USTR to consider an exemption if it is possible,” wrote Johnson’s legislative director.
In May 2019, former Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, a Republican, took Polaris’ case to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who then asked USTR for talking points in advance of a trip to Duffy’s home state. Agency chief of staff Jamieson Greer personally inquired to get an update on the 23 exclusion requests Polaris had submitted at that point. Neither Johnson nor Duffy returned requests for comment.
Polaris’ case even got the rare attention of the Treasury Department. In late July of last year, a Treasury official named David Sullivan contacted USTR about a sweeping request from Polaris to exempt “such parts and components that are for use in the manufacture or repair of off-road vehicles, motorcycles and snowmobiles in the United States,” not just specific tariff codes.
“I believe this request came from Secretary Mnuchen’s [sic] office,” wrote Brooks Allen, USTR’s assistant general counsel. Sullivan conferred with associate general counsel Arthur Tsao, who then reported back to his team: “I informed David that Polaris’s proposal is different than the requests we’ve reviewed so far. He said he’ll talk to his boss and get back to us on what Treasury wants to do.” The Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment.
All of this outreach requires some extra help in Washington. Polaris spent $800,000 on lobbying in 2019, primarily on defense and trade. That included the services of D.C. law firm Akin Gump, which both drafted extensive legal justifications for Polaris’ requests and leveraged USTR relationships to ensure they received due consideration. In early August, former Bush White House official Justin McCarthy dropped Greer a note nudging Polaris’ case.
“First, let’s grab coffee or a beer this month. Lots to chat about USMCA,” McCarthy wrote. “Second, see below from Polaris. Can you get this in front of the boss? Thanks!” Greer forwarded it along. McCarthy declined to comment further.
While expensive, Polaris’ campaign is finally bearing fruit. This spring, USTR issued a slew of exclusions, including several for the off-road recreational vehicle parts the company had requested — even some, like aluminum wheels, which had drawn objections from several U.S. companies that said they could produce them domestically or in countries other than China.
Toward the end of 2019, Wine told analysts he was starting to see glimmers of hope after more than a year of trips to Washington.
“We have been working this tariff issue very hard for quite some time,” he said on the company’s third quarter earnings call. “We did see a change in engagement and a willingness to listen and ultimately acting. We’re in the late stages of the process now and we’re certainly more confident.”

In an interview with The Daily Beast, a senior Trump official said that there was no “rational reason” for the president to do an interview with Wallace, who is widely regarded as one of the sharpest and best-prepared interviewers in the news media.
Another Trump ally, when asked by The Daily Beast why the president volunteered to be grilled by Wallace, simply responded, “I don’t f*cking know.”
“He’s going to get a certain percentage of Fox viewers voting for him no matter what, so it makes no sense to take a risk like that this late in the election cycle, especially when he’s not winning,” they added.
Trump allies describe the president’s strategy at this point in the campaign as dominating the news cycle and drawing attention to himself as much as possible to force Americans to talk about the issues he wants to discuss.
This has led to a blitz of interviews not only with Fox News, but also with “Telemundo, Gray Television, CBS, Townhall, The Washington Post, Sinclair… and Fox Business,” The Daily Beast reports.
So far, however, none of this has made a significant dent in the polls, which still show the president trailing former Vice President Joe Biden by a substantial margin.

0,2020-07-20T11:43:37+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/heres-why-the-white-house-is-sending-stormtroopers-into-portland/,Here’s why the White House is sending stormtroopers into Portland,"In one of the most alarming developments of Trump’s presidency, dozens of federal agents in full camouflage seized protesters and threw them into unmarked cars, taking them to locations unknown without specifying a reason for arrest. It appears that at least some of the agents involved belonged to the US Customs and Border Protection (colloquially known as Border Patrol), an organization that obviously has no business whatsoever conducted counterinsurgency tactics against peaceful American protesters in Portland, Oregon. Neither the mayor of Portland nor the governor of Oregon wanted them there; in fact, they specifically requested that they leave. And now a U.S. Attorney for the State of Oregon is calling for an investigation into the arrests, even as the Acting head of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, is vowing to ramp up these actions both in Portland and reportedly elsewhere.
Needless to say, this is a chilling step toward police state authoritarian rule in the United States, one that was presaged by Attorney General Barr’s approval of an pre-curfew assault on protesters instigated in Lafayette Square to clear the way for a presidential campaign photo op. Few took it seriously when leftist organizers were warning that the border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were being culturally and structurally converted into stormtroopers for the Trump regime, equally ready to be deployed against politically inconvenient American citizens as against undocumented immigrants seeking a better life. Those warnings should be heeded now.
We should not allow ourselves to become numb to this. It is helpful psychologically–even if tired and stale as a rhetorical device–to remind ourselves what the reactions would be if a Democrat were acting similarly. Imagine if President Obama had sent in in military-garbed federal stormtroopers to round up Tea Party protesters into unmarked cars, over the top of the objections of local governors and mayors. It’s unthinkable. It’s the sort of thing that drove bizarre right-wing conspiracy theories like Jade Helm, but that if any shred of them were true would instantly have embroiled the country in a civil war.
So why is Trump doing it?
Many theories abound—none of them entirely convincing on their own, but all of them deeply disturbing. One explanation is that it’s a trial run for future police state actions, partly to push the window of the possible, partly to desensitize the public to further abuses, and partly to see precisely what they can get away with and what Americans will tolerate.
This is no doubt true to a certain extent, but the challenge is that it also carries enormous downside risk. If Trump doesn’t win re-election he has less than six months left in his presidency–hardly time enough for a deeply unpopular and divisive president to engineer a police state coup. And just as with the outrage in Lafayette Square, the mere action itself will likely make Trump even more unpopular with the few undecided voters who remain.
Another convergent explanation is that making a show of supposed toughness in conducting military counterinsurgency in Democratic-controlled cities that want no part of it will thrill Trump’s base. This is reasonable to assume, since Trump’s base takes no greater joy than in seeing authoritarian cruelty exercised against their political enemies. And it’s likely true, since Trump is obsessed with his base to the exclusion of all else beyond his own personal profit. But the problem is that almost everyone in the Trump campaign’s immediate orbit beyond the president himself knows that Trump must expand beyond his shrinking base to have any chance of winning re-election. The more Trump gives aging bigots dopamine hits, the more the rest of the country falls away from him. Camouflaged stormtroopers used against American citizens will almost certainly lose him more votes than he gains.
But there is a third explanation, simultaneously dumber and yet more convincing: the Fox News effect. Trump spends endless hours watching garbage cable television, specifically One America News (OAN) and Fox News. Judging from Trump’s tweets, his entire political universe revolves around Fox News–and, more recently, the even more bizarrely propagandistic OAN when even Fox News fails to adequately toe the line.
Ever since the beginning of the protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd, Fox News has been portraying liberal American cities as hellscapes of violence in which the police and the Trump Administration played the role of hero against rampaging hordes. Most Americans, of course, didn’t see it that way. But if you live entirely in the Fox News bubble, then this narrative is as self-evident a truth as the rising of the sun in the east. Most recently, Fox News has been describing Portland in particular, in the words of former Media Matters for America contributor Oliver Willis, as if it were Baghdad circa 2003. This is not the case, of course. Crime rates in Portland have been on a steady decline for decades, with the last month being no significant exception. In fact, the worst Acting HHS Secretary Wolf could point to was literally a few instances of graffiti. No kidding.
But if Fox News were the sum of your reality, you would believe that emergency action needed to be taken before the residents started to erect a Thunderdome and the services of Snake Plissken would be required. You would send in the troops despite the potential cost out of a belief that relieved Americans would be desperately grateful for your embrace of “law and order” (even if it were heavy on the “order” and light on the “law.”) You would do whatever it took to bring the situation to heel, and figure the public approval would follow from the new Pax Trumpiana. After all, Fox News declared it must be so.
This last scenario is admittedly ridiculous. But it’s also likely closest to the truth. While figures like Stephen Miller no doubt have a laser focus on instituting an authoritarian apartheid regime to save white supremacist Republican rule the demographic tsunami preparing to overwhelm them, they are not the president. Donald Trump is. Trump is a man of impulse, not of plans. His head is not set on the next 20 years of power, but on tomorrow’s cable news ratings. The constructed reality of Fox News is his reality. The rest of the authoritarian project follows from there.
And that more than anything else likely explains why the president is precipitating a constitutional crisis by sending stormtroopers into Portland.

The closer defeat looms, the more desperate the death throes of a deranged administration. It lunges for levers of power and propaganda. It undermines institutions that stand above politics. It smears physicians who work for the public’s health. It attempts to conceal pandemic data, Soviet-style. It issues absurd decrees to local school boards to open in the fall or else. It dispatches unidentified federal forces to kidnap peaceful protesters. It flails out against measures to ease voting. And these are only the omens. A final spasm—if it is final—seems likely.
Insurgencies, dictatorships, and the like often tend toward untamed outrages as they are backed into a corner and face annihilation. Similar impulses appear ascendant in Trump’s criminal government, where the rule of law is a minor irritation and self-enrichment at taxpayers’ expense is routine. He has shed his White House of responsible advisers, replacing them with cruel dogmatists whose ideology of ignorance is a plague on the nation. It’s hard to see impediments to the abuses. Trump has no moral brakes. His values are those of a mafia boss who rewards and punishes those who protect or oppose him. Never in U.S. history has a president commuted the prison sentence of the chief witness against him, as Trump did for Roger Stone, who defied every legal requirement to testify on Russia’s alleged collaboration with the Trump 2016 election campaign. No “snitch” was Stone. His silence stymied Robert Mueller’s investigation and enabled Trump to crow, “Hoax!” The full truth may never be known.
Where are the Republicans who chant “law and order” when their party leader ignores the law and sows disorder? Where are the conservatives who don’t fight to conserve the American constitutional system that Trump and his accomplices try to shred? If there is a glaring lesson from the Trump era, it is how easily compromised are the nation’s founding principles, how deferent to autocratic aims are those who wear the camouflage of liberty: Congressional Republicans, right-wing broadcast personalities, self-righteous evangelicals, flinty citizens who make a show of individualism and resistance.
In Sinclair Lewis’s 1935 novel It Can’t Happen Here, a state militia loyal to the eventual fascist president, Buzz Windrip, “considered him their general and their god.” The militia was a precursor to the Minute Men, his private troops in black capes or white or khaki shirts, who beat, arrested, and confined—and thereby purged books, manuscripts, and thinkers from the political landscape. In 2020 America, armed right-wing vigilantes have already attacked Black Lives Matter demonstrators, and have been encouraged by the Trump campaign to “monitor” polling places in November. The smell of political violence is in the air.
This fear could be overdrawn—let’s hope so. Trump’s incompetence as a manager might save us. But he has a zealous base and a compliant coterie of collaborators. Consider this passage from Lewis and its familiar ring, describing the fictional Windrip’s supporters before a rally in Madison Square Garden: “Eighth Avenue, lined with cheapjack shops, was packed with drab, discouraged people who yet, tonight, were tipsy with the hashish of hope. . . . they were people concerned with the tailor’s goose, the tray of potato salad, the card of hooks-and-eyes, the leech-like mortgage on the owner-driven taxi, with, at home, the baby’s diapers, the dull safety-razor blade, the awful rise in the cost of rump steak and kosher chicken. . . . Kind people, industrious people, generous to their aged, eager to find any desperate cure for the sickness of worry over losing the job. Most facile material for any rabble-rouser.”
Trump’s mental and emotional disabilities have infected many under him, and they in turn create a loop of reinforcement for his most destructive impulses. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos parrots his dangerous insistence that schools reopen entirely in the fall or risk losing federal funds. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf adopts a callous plan to deport international college students whose classes proceed online (before uproars and lawsuits force a reversal). He and Attorney General Bill Barr begin to mobilize elements of law enforcement for political ends, specifically to tout “law and order” in Portland, Oregon, where the U.S. Marshal’s Service has been deployed in violation of local officials’ demands to depart and halt their violent harassment and false arrests of demonstrators. It would be wise to see Portland as only the first stepping stone toward as much repression as this administration can muster in the coming months.
Pity Trump and the country he leads. Raised in a family rife with emotional abuse, as his niece Mary Trump has documented, he suffers from narcissism and a fragile ego that deliver him to an unending reliance on lies, conflict, and bullying. His obvious brain dysfunctions prevent him from processing information, reasoning logically, remembering what he said a minute earlier, and governing effectively. He cannot stand anyone smarter or more popular than him, so his economic adviser, Peter Navarro, and anonymous acolytes try to take down Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose credibility in polls far exceeds Trump’s.
The president of what is supposed to be the greatest country in all of human history cannot tell the difference between image and reality, or cares more about image than reality, as he orders a halt in reporting COVID-19 hospitalizations to the CDC and laments the increase in coronavirus testing because it makes the case numbers go higher. Is it possible that his mental defect means that he doesn’t realize that the actual incidence of infection is a fact independent of how many are detected by tests? Or is he just trying to fool his fellow Americans? And how many will be fooled? Or frightened?
We’ll find out in November.

0,2020-07-20T11:04:39+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-pandemic-is-making-us-question-the-connection-between-work-and-money-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/,The pandemic is making us question the connection between work and money. Here’s why that’s a good thing,"“Money always wears the face of the boss.”
—Antonio Negri
An odd thing is happening during the COVID-19 crisis and its attendant economic collapse: the familiar relationship between money and work is disappearing. Most right-thinking Americans are more or less sure that money has some kind of intrinsic value that we possess when we earn it through work. As John Houseman said in the infamous television commercials made in the 1980s for the investment firm Smith Barney, “They make money the old fashioned way: they earn it.” This is tautological gibberish.
We think of money as if it were a durable good, like a car. Certainly, you can buy a car with money, so why aren’t they the same? The only difference, we imagine, is that you can’t put the car in your pocket. Money is an equivalent and a convenience. But we don’t stand before the car, and we shouldn’t look at money as if it were a thing, a bank ledger sitting upon a desk. Rather, we are inside the world of money and commodities.
And how are we brought inside? It used to be that our immersion in money came through weekly allowances for lawn mowing or through newspaper delivery. It shouldn’t surprise you to learn that we’ve teched-up those old fashioned procedures. As Guardian reporter Sally Weale wrote in 2018:
Leading [London] institutions are urging the government to include financial education in the primary school curriculum after a pilot scheme found it helped young people learn to delay gratification and enjoy the benefits of saving.
  Twenty of the UK’s leading savings and investment firms have set up a financial education initiative called KickStart Money to test the effectiveness of teaching primary school children about money management.
“Get ’em while they’re young!”
But in the heels-over-head chaos of the national economic shutdown, something strange happened—money blinked. It confessed something that threatened its legitimacy, something that a television commercial couldn’t paper over. The federal government buried any notion of value as the result of work (the idea that so much work produces so much value). The assumption that “money” was related to “work” was seen for what it was: illusory.
In broad daylight, in front of God and everybody, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve created money-for-nothing, as the appropriately-named band Dire Straights sang. Billions upon billions, trillions, falling from the sky, most of it for the purpose of keeping the banking system right side up. But some modest fraction of this money was direct deposited into personal bank accounts, if you were lucky enough to have one. Many people on unemployment discovered that they were now making more money than they had been when they were actually doing something, showing up at nine, taking their place on the conveyor belt at the meat packing plant or in the Share Spaces of the information economy. It made us wonder just what money is and how the rewards for work were now to be understood. It was plain to see: this money was Magic Money, money pulled out of an alchemist’s hat. Money was the mysterium, the matéria prima, the occult substance that turned what was base (labor) into something noble (gold). But where was its nobility now?
This new state of affairs seemed both bad and good. The bad thing was the sense of vertigo Magic Money created. Money seemed unmoored to any solid thing. If money had no dependable value, something that we “earned” through work, what about the money gathered away in our bank accounts? Could that go dancing off magically like something sprinkled with malignant pixie dust? We looked at the numbers in our bank statement and they quivered unstably, like a hallucination, like Scrooge’s worst nightmare shown to him by the Ghost of Christmas in Chapter 11. In the Dickens’s story, Scrooge learns to be generous with his money, but he does not learn that the stuff is unreal — a “pure semblance,” as Marx called it.
The possible good in this situation was that with our normal world now standing on its head, the crisis became an opportunity to reconsider what we once thought to be solid and holy. We asked, “If Magic Money can be showered upon us this year, why not other years, why not every year? Maybe that’s what socialists mean by ‘minimum basic income.'” Could money change its color and become the means for assuring universal wellbeing where individuals are not entirely at the mercy of circumstance, at the mercy of their zip code? Could we make the greenback a blueback, blue as the sky?
The reason that most members of Congress resist such notions, especially the idea of a universal basic income, is because of what it reveals about money: it is a scam, a ploy, a ruse, a confidence trick performed by people who don’t care if we live or die. Well. Aren’t we in on the con now? Perhaps we should take to the street with chants of “What do we want?” “Magic Money!” “When do we want it?” “Now!”
* * *
Another obvious, and obviously peculiar, spectacle of the COVID-19 pandemic was that it brought into full public view an unsuspected relationship between the disease and money. For some inscrutable reason, it feels as if the disease and money are two facets of one dark thing. That thing is death, and its facets are virus-death and money-death. The co-mingling of the two is no secret to the workers who have to choose between risking infection and paying the rent. It is no secret to the family of Guadalupe Olivera, a butcher at a Tyson beef-packing plant in Richland, Washington. When his daughter asked him what special precautions were in place at the plant, he replied, “There was nothing. It was business as usual.” So, did he die because of a virus, or did he die because of money? Was he a warrior hero, as Trump claimed? Or was it more like what John Ruskin saw when he wrote, “Labor is that quantity of our toil which we die in.”
There is an existential side to money-death, as when we wonder, “With the absence of work, of the dependable flow of numbers into my bank account, will I exist? I’ll look in my mirror, if I still have a mirror to call my own, and the face there will be full of worried self-scrutiny. Can’t buy anything, can’t measure my relation to others, won’t know who I am!”
In response to this anxiety, most of us say, “Work is in my blood. It’s our way of life, and I’m proud of it. It provides me with a steady income so that I can put bread on the table for my family.” We reassure ourselves with clichés. But now we can see the irony because it was never hidden: work/money is in our blood, all right, but it is in our blood like an “invisible enemy,” in Trump’s phrase, that regularly kills us. Money is “bleeding us dry.”
Money is a killer far more deadly than a biological virus. The plague driving climate change is money. Profit. Rent seeking. “Natural resource extraction,” as our statesmen drily put it. Through the single-minded pursuit of profit, humanity becomes what Reg Morrison called a “plague species.” All the industrial toxins released on land, water, and air, all the wasted forests and wetlands, all the petro-dollars poured into the same few pockets while animals of every kind wither where they stand and fall where they stood, disconsolate. Inconsolable. Cheerless. All murdered by money. As Albert Camus wrote in The Plague, “[The] social order around me was based on the death sentence.”
According to the medical journal The Lancet, 9 million people died of air and water pollution in 2015. And on May 4, 2020, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicted that by 2070 between 2 and 3.5 billion people across the globe would be trying to live in places that had become unlivable. In an interview in the Guardian, Michael Pollan commented:
As terrible as the [Corona] virus is, the heatwaves, droughts, fires and floods driven by an overheated planet have killed many more people. And if current trends persist, the death toll will increase exponentially through the end of the century.
We die, animals die, so that money may thrive. It’s a joke fit for a Marx Brothers routine, like this one from “Coconuts”, which came out in 1929 (the year of the Wall Street crash):
Chico: Right now I’d do anything for money. I’d kill somebody for money. I’d kill you for money.
[Harpo looks dejected.]
Chico: Hahaha. Ah, no. You’re my friend. I’d kill you for nothing.
One of the enduring images to come out of the pandemic was the pitiless spectacle of super-yachts floating off-shore, as far away as possible from us, the “huddled masses.” This shouldn’t be a surprise: the rich have always self-isolated. They’ve always practiced social-distancing. So much so that they’re not quite sure that the rest of us actually exist. They’ve seen us on TV, read about our problems in newspapers, but they are never among us. We are a rumor to them, something that they’ve “heard about.” We are not quite real, and certainly not as real as the people in the next yacht over.
The wealthy among us try to protect themselves against disease not by hoarding toilet paper or freeze-dried pad thai; they protect themselves by hoarding money. They save money in order to protect themselves from money. They gather money to themselves hoping for warmth, but it only provides, as we say, cold comfort. They hoard money with no idea how much is enough. They want to feel safe, but at what point does that happen?
But it’s not just “them,” because everyone is forced to think in these anxious ways. You say, “I have some money saved, so I’m good. I think it’s enough. Is it enough?” Better phone your investment planner and find out.
Or let’s say your company, or your annuity with MetLife, does send money to you regularly — and the economy is back on track, stuff is getting made, oil is trading over $100 per barrel, it’s normal, until it gets so hot one Manhattan Sunday that all of MetLife’s computers melt into the street. And now you know that playing it safe, investing that little nest egg in this golden chance and that, for thirty, forty, fifty years, that was the straightest road to hell. The economy you were so worried about is okay now, except that it’s killing you.
In coming decades many more millions, perhaps billions of people will be running from the next plague or running from a “country of origin” with average summer temperatures of 115° and up. (In late April of 2020, Las Vegas and Phoenix registered five consecutive days of record heat of 100-115 degrees. This was accompanied by record lows in the high 70s. In April.) This is what’s coming: there will be population die-offs for every species, and there will be extinction for most if not all of them. The autopsy reports will state, laconically, “Death due to complications of environmental heat exposure.”
But our really primal fear is that “they might take it away from me.” They? The crooked bankers and politicians, the Deep State, or the “gubmint”? Or perhaps it’s your neighbors that will take it all away with their extensive collection of guns that they’ve been hoarding instead of money, knowing that the Law of the AK is, in the end, the more dependable law. It’s Aesop’s grasshopper turned Rambo, banging on the ant’s door with the butt of an assault rifle. Marx called such grasshoppers the “dangerous class”:
The social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.
Thus our own Trump-loving, MAGA-hat-wearing, belly-thumping, face-mask-hating, and gun-crazy countrymen.
* * *
Through all of this, money remains unmoved. Like Ozymandias, money still says, “submit,” even though its head is rolling around on the ground. It can’t say anything other because it is afraid. Afraid of what happens if we don’t submit. Afraid of what happens when we refuse its work regime and begin to self-organize and self-develop in order to create our own satisfactions—just as we are doing now in many ways. We are beginning to reclaim what Marx called our “rich individuality” in a new way—through local and regional autonomy.
For example, the pandemic has done us the favor of stimulating the growth of “Mutual Aid” organizations that grow through local fund raising in order to meet entirely local needs. (The Black Panthers’s “survival programs”—including a free Breakfast for Children Program and health care services—were among the earliest experiments in radical localism, that is, localism outside of money.) In addition, there are grocery co-ops all over the country selling local products, and many, many CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) groups, delivering boxes of fresh produce to neighbors. CSAs are “building a new world in the shell of the old,” as the Wobblies said. It is true that gun sales are “through the roof” now, but so are the sales of chicken coops.
In short, our survival depends on flourishing local autonomy, wayward but enlightened communities enlarging their capacities within progressive regions, all with the hope that more and more places around the country and around the world will see these communities and like what they see. Working in this way, we will be enacting what Carl Boggs called “prefigurative” politics: creating now the “forms of social relations, decision-making, culture, and human experience that are the ultimate goal.” Occupy Wall Street was prefigurative, and so was Seattle’s short-lived CHOP/CHAZ, the Capital Hill Autonomous Zone: they were theatrical and earnest introductions to autonomy. CHAZ residents planted a vegetable garden. Did they imagine that they’d stay long enough to harvest? No, but that wasn’t the point. It was a demonstration garden.
So we should not merely hunker down with our hoarded food and money, hoping that we can wait it out until the economy “returns to normal.” The money on Wall Street is betting big that normal is on the way, but let’s see if we can offer an alternative wager. No more normal if it only means death. Let our alternative be what Buddhist dharma teacher Thanissara calls the “Samadhi of the Collective.” This is a homely enlightenment in a place of mutuality and generosity. Because samadhi is not only about individual release from suffering; it is also about life thriving. Samadhi is solidarity.
As jazz Arkestra leader Sun Ra said, “Heaven is where you’ll be when you are okay right where you are.”

Brace yourself for his latest. On Fox News Sunday, Trump discussed a variety of topics with host Chris Wallace this morning including his take on the Confederate flag. Not only did he defend his stance against removing Confederate symbols and statutes throughout the country, but he added the flag did not offend him because it serves as a representation of the South—once again failing to acknowledge its racist history.
“When people proudly hang their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism. They love their flag, it represents the South,” Trump said. He even had the audacity to attempt to compare it to movements against racial injustice.
“I’m not offended, either, by Black Lives Matter,” Trump said. “That’s freedom of speech.” This statement, like others made by Trump,  contradicts former allegations he has made including calling a Black Lives Matter sign in New York a “symbol of hate.”
He continued on to deflect and make use of a Republican popular phrase “cancel culture.” Trump said: “You know the whole thing with cancel culture—we can’t cancel our whole history. We can’t forget that the north and the south fought.”
Earlier this month, Trump also criticized NASCAR’s ban of the Confederate flag from events arguing that it inflicted on one’s freedom of speech. But it doesn’t end there; he also threatened to veto an amendment bill to the National Defense Authorization Act that would remove the names of Confederate generals from military bases within a year. The fact that the bill has support from military leaders and both parties in Congress does not matter to Trump.
“I don’t care what the military says. I’m supposed to make the decision,” he said. “Fort Bragg is a big deal. We won two world wars—nobody even knows General Bragg. We won two world wars.” He continued on to question what the military bases would be renamed to. “What are we going to rename it? You going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton? What are you going to name it, Chris?”
Trump’s interview follows nationwide calls to rename bases and knockdown symbols of Confederate leaders still standing throughout the country. During the ongoing protests against both police brutality and racial injustice, some of these symbols have been removed but many remain in prominent locations. These statues and monuments symbolize the racist history America is made of and systemic injustice it still perpetuates. They must be removed for the country to progress. Failing to acknowledge the importance of renaming military bases in addition to removing such statutes is not only ignorant, but depicts a lack of leadership.
Here are some highlights from the interview, including Trump’s segment on the Confederate flag."
0,2020-07-20T10:32:34+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/missouri-governor-hints-at-pardon-if-probe-is-launched-into-couple-who-aimed-guns-at-black-protesters/,Missouri governor hints at pardon if probe is launched into couple who aimed guns at Black protesters,"A white St. Louis couple who threatened anti-racism protesters at gunpoint hasn’t even been charged yet, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson is already eyeing a pardon, according to The Associated Press. Viral video showed Mark McCloskey, joined by his armed wife Patricia, pointing an assault rifle at protesters who stopped at the couple’s home in search of the St. Louis mayor’s home last month.
After Democratic Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner launched an investigation into the couple, Parson said during an interview Friday on the Marc Cox Morning Show that a pardon is “exactly what would happen.” “(…) I don’t think they’re going to spend any time in jail,” he added.
The McCloskeys accused protesters of ignoring a “No Trespassing” sign to knock down their gate, but a protest organizer has said the gate was already open, the AP reported. Parson said the McCloskeys seem to be protected under the “castle doctrine,” which allows homeowners in Missouri to use lethal force to protect their residences. “Right now that’s what I feel, you know. You don’t know until you hear all the facts and all that, but right now if this is all about going after them because they did a lawful act than yeah,” the governor said.

Parson accused Gardner, St. Louis’ first Black top prosecutor, of distrusting police and said she “needs to do her job.” “She’s missing the whole point of her oath,” Parson said. “It’s about the victims. It’s not about the police officers.”
A progressive prosecutor vowing to focus less on low-level crimes, Gardner said as a result of her probe into the McCloskeys, she’s been the target of racist threats she likens to the Ku Klux Klan’s 19th and 20th centuries practice of terrorizing Black neighborhoods. “This is a modern-day night ride, and everybody knows it,” she told The Washington Post.  She said President Donald Trump’s support of the couple “is scary.”
Trump said on July 14 the couple was probably going to be “beat up badly if they were lucky” and their house was going to be “ransacked and probably burned down.” “And now I understand somebody local they want to prosecute these people. It’s a disgrace,” Trump said."

In an opinion piece for CNN, Zelizer said that the GO should be “terrified” by polling that shows the president may suffer a “historic” loss by Trump that may see the White House and the Senate go to the Democrats with more damage at the state level as Republican voters stay home and down-ticket Republican candidates suffer.
According to the analyst, “President Donald Trump’s reelection prospects look increasingly grim, with polls showing that his ticket is vulnerable in states like North Carolina, Ohio and Texas. According to one recent Fox News poll, Joe Biden has a two-point lead over Trump in Georgia—where a Democratic presidential candidate has not won since 1992,” and that will only be exacerbated by the fact that the GOP is not drawing in much in the way of voters of color who are fast becoming the most important voting block.
Pointing out that the landslide victory by Ronald Reagan set the stage for a conservative revival that still lingers today, the analyst claimed Democrats could be on the verge of claiming a massive victory in November — due to Trump — that could also have long-ranging reverberations.
“Election victories of this scale and scope are harder to come by these days,” he wrote adding, “A landslide election is one of the few cataclysmic events that could actually challenge our current political landscape. It would leave Republicans, a party influenced by intense partisanship, to finally do some serious soul-searching and put forth constructive policies and a new political strategy in order to win again.”
According to Zelizer, that sea change could lead to turnover within the GOP leadership as the party attempts to become relevant again.
“It would force a reckoning within the party, which has stood loyally by President Trump throughout his term,” he explained. “A huge defeat could give younger voices in the GOP —rather than the Tucker Carlson types who take a deeper dive into Trumpian Republicanism—the political space to push their leadership to finally move in different directions.”
Admitting that the president might still avoid a wipeout, he also wrote, “but if these current poll numbers hold, Biden might end up accomplishing something truly historic. If he and the Democrats inflict the kind of damage on the GOP that members can’t simply forget, he might end up ushering in a ‘new normal’ that Washington has not seen in a long time by pressuring the Republican Party to think long and hard about the principles of governance and institution-building once again.”

That led internet sleuths to look up those five questions that the president assigned a high degree of difficulty and, as the Daily Beast’s Julia Davis tweeted (along with an image also published by the Las Vegas Sun), “What day is it?” and “Where are you?”
Trump about the cognitive test he took: “… The first few questions are easy, but I’ll bet you couldn’t even answer the last five questions. I’ll bet you couldn’t, they get very hard, the last five questions.”

That demonstrates how little be even remembers about the test. The “harder” questions (highest point scores) are not listed in order. For eg the visuospatial/executive task is first @ 5 points. The “hardest” question is orientation in time and place – very hard indeed!

0,2020-07-19T17:50:57+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/2020/07/the-audacity-of-white-violence/,How the violence of racial capitalism hurts us all,"“I would burn down the damn city too,” declares a pregnant white woman’s sign of sympathy for black mothers whose sons have been killed by police, posted online by Occupy Democrats. Well-meaning as this white woman may be, there is no evidence for the implication that grieving black women have resorted to violence. Since Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, the vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, and the violence on display has often involved white people, notably police officers. Rather than drawing attention to the widespread multiracial solidarity and mutual aid among the marchers, the corporate media have focused on the looting, which they condemn with more conviction than the lethal force that occasioned it. Unlike those who dismiss the demonstrators as “thugs” as soon as a storefront is shattered, at least the sign acknowledges that righteous rage can give rise to violent action. We should ask ourselves why we deplore damage to commercial assets more readily than the destruction of black life. As historian Robin D.G. Kelley put it in the New York Times, “What kind of society values property over black life?”
An honest look at history reveals this inhumane valuation as a defining feature of the United States from its inception. Since then, in the prioritization of property and profit over black lives, white people have not hesitated to employ violence. Tim Wise comments on the irony of white America admonishing black people about the evils of violence, given that we have secured our privilege and prosperity using violence at every turn, from the founding fathers to the slave patrols to today’s police brutality (to say nothing of the long history of European colonialism).
Instead of casting yet more aspersions on black people, let’s pause to clarify and contextualize what we are saying when we insist on nonviolent resistance to violence. To people on whose necks our knees have been pressing since we dragged them here in chains we are saying, “Do as we say, not as we do.” Many are endorsing “law and order” – aka more police brutality – to stop people from protesting police brutality.
Considering the centuries of whips, nooses, clubs, hoses, guns, and chokeholds, along with the denial of rights and resources routinely granted to white people, it’s remarkable that there hasn’t been more black violence. Why is there no black Dylann Roof or Timothy McVeigh? The black equivalent of boogaloo and other far-right groups? Armed black men storming a statehouse? Among other possibilities, one answer is obvious: The black men not already behind bars or dead know that any such act would be suicide.
Meanwhile, white extremist violence abounds. From James Fields, who killed Heather Heyer with his car in Charlottesville, to Steven Carrillo, who murdered two Santa Cruz County deputies and scrawled the word “boog” and “I became unreasonable” in blood on the hood of a car. “Boog” is short for boogaloo, an anti-government movement that began on the extremist site 4chan and aims to start a second American civil war. “I became unreasonable” pays homage to Marvin Heemeyer, who, seeking revenge in a zoning dispute, bulldozed 13 buildings in Granby, Colorado.
If black people bulldozed buildings after every indignity, we would all be homeless. As Kimberly Jones notes in “How Can We Win,” the viral video in which she explains our history of racial injustice in terms of a rigged game of Monopoly, white people should be grateful that blacks seek only equality and not revenge.
Although gratitude is probably not the prevailing sentiment among whites toward blacks, this is a moment of greater white recognition of the reality of racism, a moment that holds the potential for an overdue reckoning with our past – and awareness of its profound imprint in our present – both necessary for a more humane future. Still, it’s easy to see the sickening wrong in Derek Chauvin’s knee on George Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, but harder for many white people to see the systemic violence against black people. When we think of violence only as physical aggression, we fail to understand the crucial role of institutional forms of violence in maintaining the status quo.
In addition to physical force, Dictionary.com defines violence as “an unjust or unwarranted exertion of force or power, as against rights or laws.” When black people carry “Stop killing us” signs, Kelley recently explained, they are demanding an end not only to police violence, but also “the violence of poverty, the violence of a health care system that has continued to ignore our health care crises and to reproduce inequality, the violence of dilapidated housing, the violence of economic strangulation.” This systemic violence acts as a chokehold on black lives, its effects documented in a wide range of indicators from higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, to higher maternal mortality, to higher death rates from asthma. The latest data on the coronavirus show black and latinx people three times more likely to contract it and almost twice as likely to die from it. Black people get sick at younger ages, have more severe illnesses, and age more rapidly than whites, a phenomenon scientists call the “weathering effect,” due to the cumulative stress of being black in a racist society. Compounding the devastating consequences of mass incarceration on black men and their families, these conditions constitute an unjust and unwarranted exertion of power against their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and make a mockery of any claim to equality.
Americans of all races suffer under the current system
Despite the advantages white people enjoy courtesy of pale skin, we too are harmed in a racist society. Racism deforms and diminishes us all. We fail to be fully human until we open our hearts to the suffering of others. When our privilege depends on other people’s pain, we become constricted, warped versions of ourselves. Teaching a class of white third-graders the day after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, anti-racist educator Jane Elliott gave them a memorable lesson on racism by dividing them into groups according to eye color. On the first day, students with blue eyes were deemed superior, smarter and more deserving; they received extra recess and lunch time as well as exclusive access to the water fountain, while the brown-eyed children had to wear collars and drink from cups. Children who had played happily together were instantly at odds. Children who had been sweet and cooperative, inflated by their privilege, became tribalistic little beasts, nastily insulting those designated as inferior, who performed much worse in class and became despondent. The next day the roles were reversed. Elliott continued this lesson for several years, believing that the children learned to see prejudice as baseless and arbitrary and, after their time cast as inferior, to feel empathy for those subject to it. In response to criticism from parents, Elliott said, “We are worried about white children who experience a couple of hours of made-up racism for one day when children of color experience real racism every day of their lives. Why is no one outraged about that?”
In addition to the psychological damage wrought by the pathology of predatory racial capitalism, millions of white people suffer materially as well. The US’s majority-white population experiences high rates of poverty and other adverse conditions, such as lack of health insurance and unaffordable care. Though more than twice the percentage of blacks live in poverty than whites, in absolute numbers, far more whites fall below the poverty line. In Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism, economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton analyze an unprecedented trend in developed nations, the rise in deaths among white people aged 45-54 in the US, notably white men without a college degree. The authors conclude that American capitalism is failing blue-collar men, who are – via drug overdoses, drink-induced liver disease and suicide – dying of despair.
In From #Black Lives Matter to Black Liberation, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor observes that “there are 400 billionaires in the United States and 45 million people living in poverty. These are not parallel facts; they are intersecting facts. There are 400 American billionaires because there are 45 million people living in poverty. Profit comes at the expense of the living wage.”
During the pandemic, many of the people living in poverty have been deemed “essential workers,” but this label does nothing to guarantee that they earn a living wage or have access to health care, though they risk their lives continuing to supply and deliver provisions to the wealthy sheltering safely at home. As 27 million people lost their health insurance, health care industry CEOs paid themselves $2.4 billion. The federal government issued trillion-plus dollar bailouts for corporations, granted the legal rights of personhood, while failing to provide adequately for many citizens, actual people whose rights often amount to little more than labels. A New York Times headline on July 4 read, “European Workers Draw Paychecks. American Workers Scrounge for Food.”
This is economic violence, in which race and class have long been interlinked. Speaking to impoverished black sanitation workers on strike, Martin Luther King Jr. said: “Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality….What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t have enough money to buy a hamburger?” Recently Jamelle Bouie wrote of these workers: “Their oppression as black Americans and subjugation as workers were tied together. Unraveling one could not be accomplished without unraveling the other.”
A decades-long process of redistribution from the 99% to the 1% has left American workers of all races with a tattered safety net, stagnant wages, fewer rights, weaker unions, and often inaccessible health care. “George Floyd’s alleged offense was passing a fake $20 bill at a convenience store,” wrote Chris Lebron. “Corporate barons rob the American people daily to the tune of millions, but it was Floyd who got a knee to the neck.” These are not parallel facts; they are intersecting facts. Corporations get away with murder, figurative and literal (see so-called externalities) because ordinary people lack the power to stop them. The police, purportedly protecting and serving the populace, actually protect capital. In other words, inequality is not only an economic issue. One significant reason the US lags behind other nations in life expectancy and GDP per capita, David Leonhardt and Yaryna Serkez write in the New York Times, “is a lack of political power among the bulk of the population.” In our money-fueled politics, greater wealth equals greater power.
Political and economic power are more concentrated now than since the 1920s. Economic justice will require lifting people of all races out of poverty, and, crucially, the reduction of the wealth gap between black and white, itself a form of violence, an unjust exertion of power to deny black people equal opportunity. The average black family with children has just one cent of wealth for every dollar held by the average white family with children. Though some point to black celebrities as evidence of progress, in fact the magnitude of the racial wealth gap widens as black people earn more income.
But economic justice will remain out of reach until poor and working people develop interracial solidarity as a foundation for political power. The white elite has long fomented racial antagonism among working people in order to maintain power. “The purpose of racism is to control the behavior of white people, not black people. For blacks, guns and tanks are sufficient,” said the late Otis Madison, who was a black studies scholar at the University of California, Santa Barbara. White male members of the working class will continue to struggle with poverty and despair unless they see how racism keeps them divided and disempowered – and join their black, latinx, female, and immigrant peers in recognition of their shared fate.
Reality has rudely awakened those who were lulled into an Obama-era dream of a post-racial society, but many Americans have not yet emerged from the fantasy of unfettered social mobility in which we have cast off class hierarchy. In fact, we have quite low levels of social mobility, and much to learn from a class analysis. Blacks comprise a disproportionate percentage of the prison population not only because of their skin color, but also because they are disproportionately poor. The poor are most likely to be policed, arrested, and incarcerated. Because poor blacks are overpoliced, their mass incarceration is overdetermined in our racialized class structure.
A feature of systemic economic oppression, systemic racism will be eradicated only when we reduce the class divide and redistribute political and economic power from the 1% to the 99%. Not by burning down cities, but by taking down barriers to well-being, from redlines to individualism run amok, building better schools instead of barbaric prisons, creating an inclusive, participatory democracy that would preclude the violence – police and plutocrat – of the current system.
American violence abroad and at home are of a piece
This is a tall order, to be sure. American violence, though disproportionately inflicted on blacks and other people of color, permeates all of society. We have more guns per capita and more mass shootings than any other country. We consistently rank among the most militarized nations in the world, along with Israel, Russia, and North Korea. According to the 2020 Global Peace Index, produced by the  nonpartisan Institute for Economics and Peace, the United States is less peaceful than 120 of 163 countries, falling between Azerbaijan and Burkina Faso, far below such places as Haiti, Sierra Leone, and Cuba, and even further from European allies most Americans consider our closest societal peers. In many years the United States has received the worst possible score on indicators such as incarceration rates, external conflicts, and arms exports.
Our domestic and international violence are of a piece, racial injustice at home intertwined with imperialism abroad. Just as police expenditures exceed those for social services in cities across the county, the defense department budget is more than ten times that of the state department, a reflection of the primacy of militarism in US foreign policy. These are not parallel facts; they are intersecting facts. As if further evidence were needed, excess military hardware is routinely used by police.
Regarding the vaunted “American dream,” Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor observes, “This mythology is not benign. It serves as the United States’ self-declared invitation to intervene militarily and economically around the globe.” We inhabit the land of the free white supremacist, free to exploit and extract all of Earth’s bounty. The same system that oppresses black Americans sends drones to kill Yemenis, Somalis, and others, sells fighter jets and bombs to tyrants in the Middle East and elsewhere, and separates children from their parents at our Southern border. Police brutality in Minneapolis is a domestic manifestation of the international military-industrial complex.
In 1953 President Eisenhower, a five-star general and a Republican, declared: “every gun that is made, every warship launched” is “theft from those who hunger and are not fed—those who are cold and are not clothed.” It’s hard to imagine a president today uttering these words and supporting a budget that serves the people on Main Street instead of the profiteers on Wall Street. But we must do more than imagine; we must make it happen. Violence can secure power and squash dissent, but it cannot undergird a just society or enable human flourishing.
A politics of nonviolence means elevating an ethic of care
The alternative to the private despair chronicled in Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism is public solidarity. The current system creates a false sense of scarcity and pits workers against one another. Politicians warn against deficits to justify cutting social programs while the military budget remains bloated beyond reason. Material and ideological conditions push white workers to be racist and all workers to regard each other – rather than the plutocrats – with suspicion. Raising awareness of these dynamics is essential to galvanize the mass action required to move us from divisive violence to unifying nonviolence.
“Nonviolence demands that we understand relations to others as constituting who we are. Individualism is based on the denial of that relationality. If we impose regional, national, religious, racial, gendered limits on the relations by which we are defined, we adhere to group identifications that reproduce the exclusionary logic that nonviolence opposes. It has to be the stranger—the one I have never known, the one who lives at a great distance from where I live, who speaks another language I do not know—to whom I have an ethical obligation. An understanding of global interdependency, manifest now in acute forms in the pandemic world, brings to the fore these kinds of global obligations,” Judith Butler told The Nation, concluding that “an ethics and politics of nonviolence must be global in character.”
We must move from an ideology of individual insufficiency, where no amount of money is enough, competition is compulsory, and our acquisitive impulse is in perpetual overdrive, to a culture of shared abundance, where our conception of a good life is defined not by the size of our bank account but by the richness of our social bonds, the robustness of our compassion, our sense of belonging, purpose, and fulfillment.
In other words, we need what the philosopher Martin Hagglund calls a revaluation of value. The pandemic has laid bare all the ways our society devalues care, epitomized by nurses in garbage bags for lack of personal protective equipment – in telling contrast to the high-tech full-body armor of the military and police. We habitually treat the labor of care like garbage; the mostly women who perform home care, for example, are low-paid, low-status workers, many living in poverty. Teachers, to whom we entrust the education of our children, frequently struggle to make ends meet, as do childcare workers.
Our violent system of exploitation for profit depends on the devaluation of care — for people, for other species, and for the planet. Racism depends on dehumanization to justify violence to create and control labor. Maximization of profit depends on minimizing the cost of labor. The endless extraction of natural resources to produce commodities is a form of violence against the Earth. Racial, economic, and environmental injustice are not parallel facts, but intersecting ones. They result from treating people and places as disposable, of use only to be exploited until they are lifeless. All this is antithetical to care.
Even the pandemic may be the result of our lack of care for animals and their habitats. “There is a single species that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic – us. As with the climate and biodiversity crises, recent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity – particularly our global financial and economic systems, based on a limited paradigm that prizes economic growth at any cost,” according to scientists from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, an independent body dedicated to sustainable biodiversity and long-term human well-being. “Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a ‘perfect storm’ for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people,” they write.
We humans like to think of ourselves as standing apart from nature, but we belong to it no less than bats and polar bears, redwoods and rainforests. When we do violence to them, we imperil ourselves. When we treat them with care, which we can also call love, we enhance our own prospects.
A declaration of interdependence
As a Eurasian, I can endorse King’s claim that only love can drive out hate, but I have no right to insist that black people employ love to seek equality when we have them in a chokehold. “For people on the receiving end of racism, it’s hard to have to extend grace when you’re experiencing trauma,” the Reverend Leslie Copeland-Tune, the CEO of the National Council of Churches, told me. Rather than ask more of black people, let’s ask more of ourselves. Let us practice love. Then nonviolence becomes our baseline. If we think of justice as love in the public sphere, there is room for debate as to the precise forms this love might take, but no one can credibly claim that love is manifest in rat-infested housing projects in redlined ghettos, food deserts with underfunded schools, underemployment, and overpolicing. “The safest neighborhoods aren’t the ones with the most prisons and the most police — they’re the ones with the best schools, the cleanest environment, and the most opportunities for young people and working people,” notes the homepage of The Ella Baker Center for Human Rights.
Though nonviolent, our love must be fierce and unrelenting. As power is no more likely to concede without a demand than in Frederick Douglass’ day, the 99% must demand not just an end to police brutality but to the system that enables it. More white people must show up in the streets, speak out at work and elsewhere, and mobilize fellow whites to do the same. “There is no neutral ground,” says anti-racist scholar Ibram Kendi. We are either racist or anti-racist. Living as a white person without taking anti-racist action means to be complicit with the systems and policies oppressing black people, in other words, to be racist.
That said, there are shades of white complicity. From the affluent, guilt-ridden Democrat who works harder to befriend her black nanny than for black equality, to the Republican who proudly considers himself colorblind, to MAGA-hatted gunmen protesting the “tyranny” of being asked to wear a mask at Costco, to Stephen Miller. Just as we should try to understand why oppressed people might loot, we need to consider what lies behind white ignorance in order to overcome it, if only because it’s either that or civil war. If those of us committed to racial equality condescend to our white compatriots, we reinforce their sense of grievance and their determination to stand their well-armed ground. There may be whites unwilling to relinquish their racism, but we won’t know until we try to reach them. Those who deny responsibility for injustice by pointing out that they haven’t enslaved or oppressed anyone, we might ask to consider that black people too were born into a world not of their making. While white people can’t be blamed for inheriting a racist culture in which people who look like us enjoy unearned privilege at the expense of black lives, we can hold ourselves accountable for allowing it to continue or changing it. To people who doubt that racism permeates our culture, we might ask whether they would want to wake up tomorrow with brown skin. When Elliott posed this question to a white audience, not a hand went up.
If you’re ready to become anti-racist, listen to and learn from black people, but don’t burden them with your guilt or confession or even questions. Instead, ask whites already committed to anti-racism such as those at Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ). Explore anti-racism resources for white people. To do this work, we have to get uncomfortable, to acknowledge our complicity without retreating into self-involved shame. Let’s embrace this discomfort as growing pain, for only when a critical mass of white people become active anti-racists will we achieve the momentum to make all lives matter equally. If you are afraid to take a stand, remember that black people have no choice but to face the danger that confronts them in daily life, whether jogging or bird watching or having a barbeque. White parents don’t have to fear for their children when they go out to play or for Skittles; black parents do. White fear of speaking out may be understandable but it is not justifiable. We must not privilege our feelings over black lives.
Rather than tell black people how they should fight for rights we take for granted, let’s start practicing non-violence ourselves. Let’s declare our interdependence and expand our circle of compassion to include all Americans, from the single mother incarcerated because she can’t afford the fee for a broken taillight to the laid-off coal miner unable to support his family to the Karens victimizing as they fear victimization, to all people, and yet further to all sentient beings and all life on earth – what Canadian poet Stephen Collis has termed the biotariat, meaning not only workers, but animals, plants, land, and oceans, i.e., everything employed as a resource for the accumulation of wealth. Echoing its forebear the proletariat, the biotariat entails the potential for revolutionary transformation. This will require solidarity not just with struggling workers, but also with other species and the Earth’s ecosystem on which we all depend. As we move from denial and indifference to care and revaluation, we must transcend historical divisions between black and white, native and immigrant, human and non-human. If we commit to love as our lodestar, we can realize the world of King’s dream, a society that values life more than property, gratitude more than guns, and compassion more than commodities.
Unless we practice love, we should expect violence. And if we practice love, we will not accept the oppression of others. American apartheid or authentic democracy. It’s up to us.

Our invective is at most therapeutic for us with little effect on them.
They’re shape-shifters, masters of deflection, but it’s not a blur of various identities. They’re shape-togglers shuttling fluidly between two  identities, prude and brat, pope and punk, saint and cynic, family-values and incel revolt, high-horse parent and petulant child, defenders of the status quo and cultural wrecking crew, upholders of moral propriety and anarchist dismantlers.
Yes, that’s just another example of the cult’s hypocrisy, but I think it’s the pivotal one, the mother of all of their hypocrisies. It’s how they declare us losers for not meeting their moral standards and losers for caring about moral standards. These shape-togglers reproach us for our political incorrectness and conversely for being PC.
Holy war is an oxymoron: Holiness is a commitment to righteousness but all’s fair in war. There’s no racket one can’t dignify with holy war because there’s no deed too dirty for the saints who wage it.
They don’t just go low. They go above and below, anywhere but meeting us at eye level. They’re pedant parents talking down to us, or petulant teens complaining about how domineering we are. That’s how they escape adult-to-adult debate. It’s “shame on you!” when that’s to their advantage and when we try shaming them, it’s “So what? You do it too” cynicism.
You don’t have to be dumb to become one of these shape-toggling assholes fluidly shifting between playing saint and boor. You just have to be a little hungry, lazy, or swept up in some supposedly holy war.
The dumbness comes easily with time. Thinking about your inconsistency only gets in the way. Discover this shape-toggling trick and your mind just atrophies. You’ve found a more efficient way to thrive: Ignore words. Listen for sounds. If you hear threats to your authority, ape saintly high-horse condemnation. If you hear concern and care, ape crass ridicule and contempt. That’s all. Two buttons; two pre-recordings. You’ll find you no longer need a mind or a heart. Nothing purges a conscience as fast as outrage and with shape-toggling you have the only two routes to outrage you’ll ever need – caring and not caring about moral standards.
Their cardinal sin is something viral. It’s not alive and yet it’s a parasite that makes zombies of people – not just the MAGA cult – that’s just the current epidemic. There have been epidemics of it throughout history.
No deed too dirty for the  holy followers of Christ, Hitler, Stalin, the Jihadists. It’s how anyone plays God, eternally omnificent, omnipotent and omniscient. It’s the ass-holy trinity whereby saintliness licenses sin, sin wins and winning “proves” saintliness.
This zombie-like rhetorical end-run is, I’d argue the most probable cause of human extinction. Why? Because there’s no talking to those infected. Reality, which zombies refuse to heed gives them the ultimate smackdown.
Here’s a four minute video I made about it:
