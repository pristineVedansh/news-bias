""I'm totally involved and we are going to be doing something things that are good,"" said President Donald Trump. 
President Trump sent White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Capitol Hill hoping to strike a deal with Democrats. 
""We're not close yet, but it was a productive discussion,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
Schumer says money for state and local needs as well paying for schools to open safety is a must. 
""What started as probably the first day of a good foundation, production discussions, and building upon those until we reach an agreement,"" said Meadows.
The agreement hinges on unemployment benefits. Democrats want the original $600 a week extended until January 2021. Republicans want to reduce the amount to $200 a week.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) argues 30 million Americans count on that support for food, housing, and childcare. 
""What we are doing is not only trying to arrest the virus but to invest in the economy,"" said Pelosi. 
But the White House argues the higher amount hurts the economy because some people make more money by remaining unemployed. 
""There's no question in certain cases where we're paying people more to stay home then to work that's created issues in the entire economy,"" said Mnuchin. 
Congress is now getting ready for an August recess which puts more pressure on lawmakers to hash out a deal.

The idea was quickly shot down by Democrat and Republican lawmakers alike. Trump eventually addressed the issue on Thursday night during a press conference.
""Do I want to see a day change? No, but I don't want to see a crooked election,"" Trump said. ""This election will be the most rigged election in the history if that happens.""

Trump Proposes Election 'Delay': Here's What the 20th Amendment to the US Constitution Says
'Absolute Catastrophe': New York's Mail-In Mess and What It Could Mean for the Presidential Election
Trump points to concerns over voter fraud and the massive problems with a Presidential election depending so heavily on mail-in voting. 
 
""Well, what I want to explain to people, but it doesn't need much explanation, I mean you look at article after article. New York's mail vote disaster. Tens of thousands of mail ballots have been tossed out of this year's primaries. What will happen in November?"" Trump asked.
New York tried to let residents vote by mail in the June primaries, and that led to massive delays, the system was overwhelmed with votes and many races still haven't been counted weeks later. 
New York warns the situation could get even worse in November. 
MORE 'Absolute Catastrophe': New York's Mail-In Mess and What It Could Mean for the Presidential Election
 
""A switch from almost no absentee ballots to approximately 50 percent absentee ballots in with two months notice rally strains the system,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. 
The President referred to multiple news stories about the concerns with mail-in voting. California also experienced major problems where more than 100,000 mail-in votes were rejected in the Presidential primaries in March.

The Heritage Foundations's Hans Von Spakovsky explained on CBN's Faith Nation that one problem with mail-in voting is the rejection rate is much higher than polling places. 
 
""What election officials need to be doing is trying to ensure that as many polling places are open to vote in person, but using all the same safety protocols we're using when we go to the grocery store or our pharmacies,"" Von Spakovsky said. ""Look, the CDC just released guidelines on how to safely do in-person voting with all those kind of safety protocols in place.""
President Trump doesn't have the power to change the date of the election anyway, that's up to Congress, and they certainly don't plan to do so. But the concerns over a heavy dependence on mail-in voting aren't new. 
 
Meanwhile, a Wall Street Journal editorial warned in May that a close presidential election could lead to an election nightmare – with a close race where many votes aren't counted or thrown out, and lawsuits are filed. That could lead to an election that could further divide an already polarized country."

Alyssa Farah, the White House Director of Strategic Communications spoke with CBN's David Brody Thursday at The White House about the use of hydroxychloroquine, which has been at the center of much coronavirus controversy. 
""I would start by saying the president is the 'Right-to-Try President',"" Farah tells CBN News. ""He passed historic legislation that helps terminally ill patients try medications that are still in the trial phase, anything to try to save their lives. So that's the mindset he approaches this virus with as well. We've always said while talking about hydroxychloroquine, you should only take it in consultation with your medical professional, so with a doctor."" 
 
In the wide-ranging interview, Farah also discussed the possibility of mail-in ballot fraud in 2020, plus the president's plan to protect those in the suburbs from anarchists and violence. Below are some other highlights from the interview. You can see more tonight on CBN's nightly Faith Nation show at 6pm ET. 
 
On COVID-19 and Hydroxychloroquine
David Brody: ""If you hear the media talk about COVID-19, they like to say that this President has, 'blood on his hands.' What is the reaction when this administration hears that type of talk from the media?""  
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Well, first off, it's a tragedy that our nation is united in that we've lost 150,000 Americans. This weighs heavier on no one's heart than the President's. I'm in with him in meetings daily, when he's getting updates. He's getting data reports. He's deploying PPE, he's sending support to states. He doesn't let the noise bother him. It's hard for those who care about him and those around him. He's focused on leading though, and what our government has been able to do to respond to this unprecedented crisis is truly amazing. One thing I would tell your viewers that I think is important to know is just how far we've come since March and April at the height of this virus. Yes, cases are still rising but we have therapeutics, we have PPE, we have hospital capacity. We've actually got some exciting announcements coming on further therapeutics soon, and we're racing toward a vaccine. And that is all thank you to President Trump's leadership.""  
 
David Brody: ""So you think that media narrative is pretty much bogus?""  
  
Alyssa Farah: ""It is. Listen the media plays an important role in public health and in getting information to the American people. What's not helpful is when they're weighing in and not giving all the facts, not properly contextualizing it, and really politicizing what is a tragedy. We all really need to be united and together."" 
  
David Brody: ""Hydroxychloroquine There are a lot of folks who say the President was right all along. What's the feeling inside the White House about hydroxychloroquine?"" 
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Well, I would start by saying the president is the ""Right-to-Try President."" He passed historic legislation that helps terminally ill patients try medications that are still in the trial phase, anything to try to save their lives. So that's the mindset he approaches this virus with as well. We've always said while talking about hydroxychloroquine, you should only take it in consultation with your medical professional so with a doctor. "" 
  
On 2020 and Election Fraud 
 
David Brody: ""There was a tweet from the president this morning on Thursday morning, where he talked about, and he put a lot of question marks after, but should the election be delayed? We've already heard Senator Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz come out and say no, we're not going to delay the election. What was the thinking behind that tweet?""   
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Yes. So the President was raising awareness about the issues with mass mail-in voting. So he's been raising alarms about this for a while. When you have states send out mass ballots to voters to turn in at any time, so they're ripe for fraud. So an example we would point to is a New York congressional district had their election weeks ago. But the results have yet to be called three weeks later, because of mass mail-in voting, some fraud-related too, and not just not being able to account for the ballots. So the point he's making is, if we go to this model, and we do this across the board, how can we even be sure that the election results are going to come on Election Day?"" 
  
On the Recent Economic Numbers 
  
David Brody: ""The economy. Some tough numbers today (Thursday) in that second quarter. What does that portend for the future potentially because last time I checked, the third quarter comes after the second quarter. And oh, by the way, that could be right around October."" 
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Yes. So we were anticipating poor numbers for Q2, just to be honest. If you think about it, in April and May the economy was artificially shut down to deal with coronavirus. So millions of businesses weren't operating. Money wasn't being circulating in the economy. We started some phases of reopening in June. So actually our projections showed it would be worse than 32% that it ended up being, but we do think GDP growth is a bit of a lagging indicator. We expect that Q3 is going to be significantly better.""  
  
On Law and Order 
 
David Brody: ""He says he is the president of law and order. And of course, what we've seen in Portland, for 63 straight nights been hard to watch. What's the view of this White House when you see Democrats like Jerry Nadler and others at the (Attorney General) Barr hearing the other day and others who were saying they're calling these folks protesters, sometimes peaceful protesters, and we're seeing that the images are the exact opposite?"" 
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Oh, it's the exact opposite. And we've been getting footage. The Department of Homeland Security has been doing an incredible job trying to maintain the peace in the streets of Portland. And frankly, the governor and local police enforcement have not stepped up to the job. And what you see is organized agitators, you see anarchists trying to burn down a federal courthouse. Men and women across this country aren't going to stand for that. We've heard tremendous feedback on this issue. It's one that just really resonates with the American people because if we're not going to defend our federal buildings, what's next? Is it my neighborhood next?""

John Lewis,"An emotional homegoing service was held Thursday in Atlanta for US Rep. John R. Lewis, capping six days of celebration of the life and legacy of the civil rights legend.
The elaborate procession involved a horse-drawn carriage, parades, and a military escort along the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, along with lying in state at the nation's Capitol before being taken to his final resting spot in his adopted home state of Georgia.
At Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. served as a pastor before he was assassinated, family, friends, and co-laborers in the Civil Rights movement filled the pews.
Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock called it, ""The spiritual home of John Robert Lewis - America's freedom church.""
   
It was a final farewell to the man dubbed the conscience of Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-CA) said, ""To John Miles, to the entire Lewis family. Thank you for sharing John Lewis with us.""
Lewis was an ordained Baptist minister who practiced preaching to chickens as a young boy. Today he was honored by civil rights leaders, public officials, and three former presidents as a peaceful soldier of ""redemptive suffering"" who stood up to injustice.
    
President Bill Clinton said, ""I'm so grateful he stayed true to form. He's gone up yonder and left us with marching orders.""
    
President George W. Bush also joined in, saying, ""We live in a better and nobler country today because of John Lewis and his abiding faith in the power of God.""
    
And President Barack Obama spoke as well, saying, ""When we do form a more perfect union — whether it's years from now, or decades, or even if it takes another two centuries — John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.""
    
Lewis' friend, William Craig Campbell, a former Atlanta Mayor, summed up his life in this way: ""John Lewis was love. Good night, sweet prince.""
Lewis died July 17 at the age of 80.

Speaking in Texas on the campaign trail Wednesday, the president said the policies of the ""radical Left"" would mean the death of American prosperity and devastate America's energy industry. He points out that oil-rich Venezuela was once prosperous and successful, but now it's an economic wreck, and that could also happen to the US if we take the same path.
The president singled out Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's nearly $100 trillion Green New Deal and argued that Joe Biden's plan to mandate ""zero-carbon emissions from power plants by 2035"" will hurt America.
Earlier this month Biden announced his plan to spend $2 trillion over four years to create green energy, saying, ""God willing I win and even if I serve eight years, I want to make sure we put down such a marker that it's impossible for the next president to turn it around."" 
Trump contends that would be disastrous. ""The US energy industry would grind to a halt, and every single energy-producing state would be plunged into a depression,"" he said. ""Two million jobs would vanish overnight in just the state of Texas alone.  And I think the number is probably a lot higher than 2 million. Millions more would disappear in New Mexico and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania.""
""The policies required to implement this extreme agenda would mean the death of American prosperity and the end of the American middle class. It would mean, I think, even worse than that. It would destroy our country. I used to say, 'Would become another Venezuela.' Same ideology. You would become another Venezuela. Venezuela used to be one of the richest in the world, per capita, and period, one of the richest in the world — among the largest oil reserves. Now they don't have water, they don't have medicine, they don't have food. You got a lot of oil; it doesn't matter. Doesn't seem to matter. They don't have anything. And that can happen to us.""
Trump Points to the Riots in Portland
Trump also points to the riots in Portland as just one example of why the threat of the far-Left should be taken seriously. He says if the problem there isn't solved locally very soon, he'll send in the National Guard.
""All you have to do is look at Portland. Look at the agitators.  Look at the anarchists in Portland. And our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse. And I told my people, a little while ago: If they don't solve that problem locally, very soon, we're going to send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly,"" he said.
Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has announced the Trump administration will withdraw federal officers who've been protecting the federal courthouse in Portland under nightly attack by radical protestors.
Local officials claim their presence is making the situation worse. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said local and state officers will now protect the courthouse.
However, Trump is sending a different message, saying the agents won't leave Portland until the city is secure. The president is accusing Democratic leaders in several cities and states of not standing up to violent protestors.

“I’m bracing for the cruelty online about how he deserved to get COVID and die because of his politics,” wrote Ellen Carmichael. “We’re living in a dark time. But, they didn’t know him. I did.”
Carmichael took on the task of serving as Cain’s communications director at the age of 23, when she was right out of college. She described her time working with the accomplished businessman-turned-politician as “a chaotic experience,” recalling her time “explaining away gaffe after gaffe from an unpolished candidate.”
While the work “was really hard and exhausting,” it was absolutely worth it, because Cain “was a giant of a person in ways that people who would choose to see him merely as a caricature could never understand.”
You're never ready for the kind of news we are grappling with this morning. But we have no choice but to seek and find God's strength and comfort to deal... #HermanCain https://t.co/BtOgoLVqKz
— Herman Cain (@THEHermanCain) July 30, 2020
Before running for the Republican nomination for president in 2012, Cain, born and raised in Atlanta, served as a systems analyst for the Department of the Navy — a position he earned after earning a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Morehouse College in 1967 and a master’s degree in computer science from Purdue University in 1971.
He later became a business analyst for the Coca-Cola Company, where he remained until 1977, when he was hired to manage an analysis group at the Pillsbury Company. He later left that position to lead a Philadelphia unit of Pillsbury’s Burger King franchises, which he saved due to a number of customer service and employee morale initiatives he incorporated.
Cain is perhaps best known, though, for taking Godfather’s Pizza, a struggling Pillsbury holding, and turning it around in just 14 months.
“This man knew business and he knew people,” wrote Carmichael. “His signature approach was to go to the people closest to the problem to solve it. It worked.”
In addition to his success in business and politics, Cain fought — and “miraculously” won — his battle against stage-four liver and colon cancer.
ANYTHING ELSE?
Carmichael also shared an anecdote from her time on the campaign trail with Cain. The recollection revealed quite a bit about the late politician’s character.
The now-32-year-old Carmichael wrote about remarks Cain made “about wanting to stop the construction of a mosque in Tennessee” — a position with which Carmichael disagreed.
“He understandably got a lot of blowback on this,” she wrote. “But, members of a northern Virginia mosque opened their doors to him. They educated him. They broke bread with him. They had him speak to summer campers. He called me from the airport, voice cracking from holding back tears.”
“He told me how wrong he had been, how wonderful of a time he had and how they invited him to speak at a future Friday service,” Carmichael added. “His life was clearly changed by the experience. I hung up the phone and cried myself.”
Despite the various opinions people have about Cain’s politics, Carmichael wrote that her former boss “was a really good person … and despite the challenges he faced in his life, he deeply loved his country with his whole heart.”
In conclusion, the former communications director thanked Cain for hiring her. “Rest in peace, Herman,” she wrote. “May you have your eternal reward.”
At the age of 23, I served as the communications director for Herman Cain’s presidential campaign. It was a chaotic experience, which explains how someone fresh out of college could find herself explaining away gaffe after gaffe from an unpolished candidate.

Finally, I wish I could tell him this:

He tweeted, ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???""

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2020
Trump's tweet comes on the heels of widespread vote-counting problems after New York's mail-in-voting election which was caused by the pandemic.
New York Democrat candidate Suraj Patel, who is running against US Rep. Carolyn Maloney, is suing over the mail-in voting problems, pointing out that 30 percent of mail-in ballots received in his Brooklyn congressional district were discarded.
President Trump's Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany blasted New York's vote counting as an ""absolute catastrophe"" and a reason to question voting by mail.
  
The US presidential election is always slated for the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. That's mandated by federal law so it would require an act of Congress to change, and with Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, that seems unlikely. 
Inauguration Day Is January 20, No Matter What
One way or another, the presidential inauguration for the next US president will take place on Jan. 20, 2021 as mandated by the 20th Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The 20th Amendment states:
Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.
Due to the pandemic, there's been a push by some states to mail ballots or absentee request forms to all registered voters. Previously, voters needed to request an absentee ballot, verifying their ID in order to vote.
Mail-in voting raising concerns for many observers. Lisa Dixon, executive director of the Lawyers Democracy Fund, says, ""Election experts on both the Right and Left agree that voting by mail is the system, the method of voting that's most susceptible to fraud.""
US Attorney General William Barr told a House committee this week he believes there is “a high risk” that mail-in voting would lead to “massive” fraud. “If you have wholesale mail-in voting, it substantially increases the risk of fraud,” he said.
President Trump has called remote voting the “biggest risk” to his reelection. He told supporters in Arizona last month, “This will be, in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country.""

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) has tested positive for the novel coronavirus ahead of his planned trip with President Donald Trump.
The Republican was slated to travel with the president on Air Force One for a campaign fundraising event at an oil rig in Midland, according to Fox News.
In a video posted to his Twitter account Wednesday afternoon, Gohmert disclosed he has tested positive for COVID-19 but said he has, so far, been “asymptomatic.”

On Tuesday, Gohmert attended an hours-long hearing on Capitol Hill, where Attorney General William Barr testified. Kerri Kupec, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, said Barr will be tested Wednesday for COVID-19 because of his proximity to the Texas lawmaker.
Gohmert, who has done much — but not all — of his business in Washington, D.C., without a mask, was very close to Barr at one point.
ACTUALLY... here is a video of AG Barr and Gohmert.

As for why he hasn’t been wearing a facial covering, Gohmert told CNN in June he was being tested regularly for COVID-19. Trump, for his part, has used the same reasoning to defend his decision to not wear a mask, though he has been seen wearing one during recent appearances.
The president encouraged Americans to wear masks earlier this month, calling the practice “patriotic.”"

Soros's contributions include several hundred thousand to the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, the Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund, and the Biden Victory Fund.
One GOP worker told the Free Beacon, ""George Soros's unprecedented spending further highlights just how dependent Democrats are on contributions from billionaires, despite their hypocritical rhetoric.""
Soros, 89, said he views the 2020 elections as pivotal, saying the ""fate of the world"" is at risk.
Soros heavily supports the ""vote-by-mail"" system which has gained momentum due to COVID shutdowns, and includes ""drop boxes inaccessible locations for voters to drop off ballots directly.""
In a vote-by-mail system, voters receive a mail ballot, which is filled out and mailed back to the local registrar of voters.
Critics say the mail-in system benefits the Democratic Party, and Republicans worry about the possibility of voter fraud since mail-in voting is difficult to verify.
The latest attempts at mail-in voting in New York have caused severe delays and confusion in the vote-counting, overloading the election system.

Where police brutality is concerned, the AG recognized there is a problem but offered a caveat.
""According to statistics compiled by The Washington Post, the number of unarmed black men killed so far this year by police is 8...the number of unarmed white men killed by police is 11,"" Attorney General Bill Barr said.  
""The leading cause of death for black males is homicide. Every year approximately 7,500 black Americans are victims in homicide. The vast majority, around 90 percent, are killed by gunfire, and each of those lives matter.""
Democrats accused Barr of doing the president's bidding by helping Trump's friends avoid punishment - claims the AG rebuffed.
""I agree the president's friends don't deserve special breaks but they also don't deserve to be treated more harshly than other people,"" Barr said. ""I'm supposedly punishing the president's enemies and helping his friends. What enemies have I indicted?""
Republican Minority Leader Jim Jordan referred to the Russia collusion investigation, saying Tuesday's hearing was all about one word.
""Spying, that one word, that's why they're after you Attorney General,"" Jordan said. ""You said you think spying on a political campaign is a big deal. And since that day when you had the courage to state the truth,  they've been attacking you for simply telling the truth: that the Obama/ Biden administration spied on the Trump campaign.""
Barr did not read aloud part of his prepared remarks that referred to what he thinks of the Russia investigation, but they were released in advance to the press.  Here's what he wrote:
""Ever since I made it clear that I was going to do everything I could to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus Russiagate scandal, many of the Democrats on this committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the president's factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions.""
The Mueller report and voter fraud were also brought up in the hearing.  In fact, one Republican lawmaker said Barr was blamed for so much, he's surprised Democrats didn't try to pin the COVID-19 pandemic on him.

(AP) — New York’s quest to keep voters safe from COVID-19 by letting them vote by mail in the June primary has led to big delays in tabulating results, concerns about disenfranchisement — and questions about whether there will be an even bigger mess in the fall.
Election officials say it will take them until early August to finish counting a tidal wave of absentee ballots that overwhelmed a system which typically handles only around 5% of the vote. About 1.8 million New Yorkers requested mail-in ballots for New York’s primary.
Voting ended June 23, but the results of many races, including two closely watched congressional primaries, are still unknown.
A bigger problem than the delays, though, is that thousands of votes cast in good faith are getting invalidated during the counting process, candidates and good-government activists say.
Some ballots are being knocked out because voters forgot to sign and date them; others because envelopes lacked postmarks that would indicate whether the ballot was dropped in the mail in time to beat the voting deadline.
President Donald Trump’s press secretary, Kayleigh Mcenany, in a press conference this week lambasted New York’s vote counting as an “absolute catastrophe” and a reason to question voting by mail.
Candidates and voting rights groups, including the Brennan Center for Justice, are pushing state lawmakers to fix procedural problems now so the issues don’t repeat themselves in the general election in November, when even more people may try voting by mail.
New York City elections officials have refused to release statistics on the number of invalidated votes. But Suraj Patel, a Democrat locked in a close primary race with U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, said 30% of mail-in ballots received in the Brooklyn part of the congressional district were being rejected.
“This election and New York’s response, including the Senate and the Assembly, is providing Donald Trump with a blueprint to game the November elections unless they act,” Patel said.
The plan to let voters cast ballots by mail was hatched hastily and announced in April as the coronavirus outbreak was killing hundreds of people a day in New York City and its suburbs.
In the midst of the crisis, the state never provided extra funds to prepare election workers who would be handling mailed ballots or to hire extra staff to count them.
Many voters who applied for absentee ballots didn’t get them until the last minute, leaving them wondering whether they should vote in person or try the mail and potentially miss a deadline to have the envelope postmarked by June 23.

Compounding that problem, the state’s attempt to make things easier for voters by giving them postage-paid return envelopes backfired: The U.S. Postal Service doesn’t usually put postmarks on that kind of metered mail, and while its policy is to add the postmark to mailed ballots, it admits it failed to do so on some envelopes.
Candidates and activists are now claiming in a lawsuit that thousands of properly cast ballots mailed in on time were invalidated because they lacked postmarks.
The state Board of Elections said it’s too early to know how many ballots didn’t make it out to people in time or were discarded because the Postal Service failed to postmark them.
“It’s very unfortunate that the Postal Service was unable to fully carry out what they have acknowledged was their responsibility in postmarking the mail,” said state board of elections spokesman John Conklin.
A spokesperson for the Postal Service said it is addressing the issue.
Five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah — have conducted all elections by mail for years with relatively streamlined systems, while 21 other states allow localities to opt into mail-in elections, according to National Conferences of State Legislatures.
Common Cause New York Executive Director Susan Lerner called it “unacceptable and unfortunate” that so many absentee ballots are being disqualified.
“Right now an absentee ballot can be discarded if a cautious voter puts tape on their envelope to make sure the ballot doesn’t fall out,” she said.
Her group wants lawmakers to allow voters to request absentee ballots earlier and allow election workers to start counting absentee ballots sooner after Election Day.
Lawmakers could revamp a system widely viewed as outdated. By Thursday evening, the state Senate passed bills to accept absentee ballots received by June 24, ensure voters fearful of catching COVID-19 at polls can vote by mail in November, and give absentee voters a chance to fix deficient ballots.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has voiced support for lawmakers tweaking the state law that lays out the time period when absentee ballots can be accepted.
But it’s unclear whether New York will allow election workers to count all ballots lacking a postmark, including those received days after Election Day. Patel, Maloney, and other candidates have called for Cuomo to update his executive order to protect June 23 primary voters from disenfranchisement.
And lawmakers plan to hold a hearing in August on how election workers have handled the spike in absentee ballots.
“We’re studying the issue from a system-wide point of view. And any changes we can make, we will,” Cuomo said.

0,2020-07-27T13:30:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/july/body-of-civil-rights-icon-john-lewis-arrives-in-dc-to-lie-in-state-at-capitol,Body of John Lewis Arrives in DC to Lie in State at Capitol," WASHINGTON (AP) - The body of the late Rep. John Lewis has arrived in Washington to lie in state as lawmakers gather to pay tribute to the long-time Georgia lawmaker and icon of the civil rights movement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a delegation Monday to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to greet Lewis’s flag-draped casket. A motorcade carrying the body stopped at Black Lives Matter Plaza as it winds through Washington on its way to the U.S. Capitol, where he will be the first black lawmaker to lie in state in the Rotunda. 
Pelosi and others will attend a private ceremony in the Rotunda before Lewis’s body is moved to the steps on the Capitol's east side for a public viewing, an unusual sequence required because the COVID-19 pandemic has closed the Capitol to the public. Inside the Rotunda and outdoors, signs welcomed visitors with a reminder that masks would be required. 
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who served in Congress alongside Lewis, is expected to visit the Capitol to pay his respects. The pair became friends over their two decades on Capitol Hill together and Biden’s two terms as vice president to Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president who awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.
Notably absent from the ceremonies was President Donald Trump, who publicly jousted with Lewis. Lewis once called Trump an an illegitimate president and chided him for stoking racial discord. Trump countered by blasting Lewis’s Atlanta congressional district as “crime-infested.” 
Just ahead of the ceremonies Monday, the House passed a bill to establish a new federal commission to study conditions that affect Black men and boys.
Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Reps. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Karen Bass of California, were seen sporting “Good Trouble” face masks, a nod to one of Lewis’s favorite pieces of advice.
“Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic,” Lewis tweeted in 2018. “Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble.”
The tributes Monday were the latest in a series of public remembrances for the 80-year-old Alabama native who helped lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the peak of the civil rights era. 
The son of sharecroppers, Lewis was among the original Freedom Riders, a group of young activists who boarded commercial passenger buses and traveled through the segregated Jim Crow South. They were assaulted and battered at many stops along the way, by both citizens and authorities. Lewis was the youngest and last-living of the featured speakers for the March on Washington in 1963, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
In Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965, Lewis suffered a beating at the hands of an Alabama state trooper that became one of the defining moments of his life. He was at head of hundreds of civil rights protesters who attempted to march from the Black Belt city to the Alabama Capitol to demand access to the voting booth. 
The marchers completed the journey weeks later under the protection of federal authorities, but then-Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, an outspoken segregationist at the time, refused to meet the marchers when they arrived at the Capitol. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on Aug. 6 of that year. 
Lewis spoke of those critical months for the rest of his life as he championed voting rights as a foundation of democracy, and he returned to Selma many times for commemorations at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where baton-wielding officers had brutalized Lewis and the marchers.
“The vote is precious. It is almost sacred,” he said again and again. “It is the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democracy.”
Lewis crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the last time Sunday on a horse-drawn carriage before an automobile hearse transported him to the Alabama Capitol, where he lay in repose, becoming one of the few citizens who wasn’t a former governor to have such an honor. He was escorted by Alabama state troopers, this time with Black officers in their ranks, and his casket stood down the hall from the office where Wallace had peered out of his window at the voting rights marchers he refused to meet. 
Lewis already has had a public funeral in his hometown of Troy, Alabama. He will have a private funeral Thursday at Atlanta’s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, which King once led.

Each day roughly 20 military veterans take their life – a staggering number that's remained consistent for years. The Trump administration hopes a new pro-active approach will help prevent suicide. 
In 2019, the president signed an Executive Order offering a roadmap of sorts to help stop the heartbreak.  Second Lady Karen Pence serves as the lead ambassador for the effort, known as ""PREVENTS"", which stands for the ""President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide"".

""I saw my role as a way to say, let's end the stigma, and let's start the conversation,"" the Second Lady tells CBN News. ""Everybody has risk factors for suicide, every single one of us.""
The numbers are hard to fathom: each year, there are more than 47,000 suicides across America, more than 6,000 of them are veterans. That translates to a rate that is double that of the general population. 
""There's help for our veterans, there's help for Americans,"" Karen Pence says. ""We actually have things we're putting into place. We want people to talk to each other and part of talking to each other and reaching out is sharing your faith.""

This weekend, the administration is looking to the faith community because believers are of vital importance. 
""The research supports that there is a connection between people having an involvement in their faith community and having less opportunity or less desire to commit suicide,"" the Second Lady says. 
In that spirit, an effort called ""REACH,"" is going out this weekend for houses of worship to directly address suicide. The administration hopes it will be the subject of sermons, feature information about prevention in bulletins, and encourage those in attendance to take a written pledge, committing to change the national conversation around mental health and suicide. 
""One of the main points involved in the REACH campaign is letting people know their risk factors and one of the risk factors right now is isolation,"" says Karen Pence. 
Indeed, with COVID-19, the fear of the unknown can be unsettling for all of us –  something the Second Lady can fully understand. ""All of us are dealing with some kind of anxiety or pressure or fear, and so what better time to say it's okay to say you're not okay."" 
Since COVID-19 began, Karen Pence's team has pushed a mental health checklist that includes asking yourself how you're doing, talking to family members, reaching out to the suicide prevention line if you need help, and trying and give yourself a joyful break. 
""What are some things that make you feel happier or kind of calm you down?"" she says. ""Schedule those into your day, whether it's reading, gardening or cooking, or praying or painting.""
The Second Lady, who is a devout Christian, tells CBN News her ultimate hope comes from above. ""Hope really is the key and for me, as you know, I'm a Christian. That's where I get my hope."" 
That comes into play all the time but especially when hard times inevitably come your way. ""I do think that when we're all low, sometimes the only person who's there for me is the Lord,"" the Second Lady tells CBN News. ""So when you actually can introduce someone to that aspect and to say, you know what, there is hope, there is hope and there is a way past this struggle that you're in right now.""

Trump had already moved the convention from North Carolina and dramatically scaled back its programming and attendance in Jacksonville in an effort to keep it on track. But the nights of ’infomercial” programming and parties appeared to be both a health and political risk to Trump and his advisers, who feared that going forward with the event, set to draw more than 10,000 people, would ultimately backfire on the president.
“It’s a different world, and it will be for a little while,” Trump said, explaining his decision during one of his newly resuscitated White House briefings on the coronavirus. “To have a big convention is not the right time.”
A small subset of GOP delegates will still formally renominate Trump on Aug. 24 in Charlotte, the original host city before Trump moved the ceremonial portions of the GOP convention to Florida last month amid a dispute with North Carolina’s Democratic leaders over holding an event indoors with maskless supporters. That event is scheduled to last just four hours in the morning.

Trump’s plans for the Florida convention were scaled back almost as quickly as the move was announced, as virus cases spiked in Florida and much of the country over the last month.
Trump said he would deliver an acceptance speech in an alternate form, potentially online.
Trump said thousands of his supporters and delegates wanted to attend the events in Florida, but “I just felt it was wrong” to gather them in a virus hot spot. Some of them would have faced quarantine requirements when they returned to their home states from the convention.
“We didn’t want to take any chances,” he added. “We have to be vigilant. We have to be careful, and we have to set an example.”
Democrats will hold an almost entirely virtual convention Aug. 17-20 in Milwaukee using live broadcasts and online streaming, according to party officials. Joe Biden plans to accept the presidential nomination in person, but it remains to be seen whether there will be a significant in-person audience.
The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to messages Thursday seeking comment on Trump’s announcement.
In recent weeks, Trump aides and allies have encouraged the president to consider calling off the convention, advising him it was not worth going forward with the event if the focus would be on the pandemic. Trump acknowledged that consideration, saying, “I could see the media saying, ‘Oh, this is very unsafe.’”
After a three-month hiatus, Trump has stepped back to the forefront of the government’s handling of the virus with regular briefings aiming to stanch an erosion of support in public and private polls that has followed the surge in new virus cases.
Trump said he did not cancel the event at the request of local officials, but the Jacksonville City Council was set to meet Friday to discuss safety concerns around the convention.
Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry, who is a former chair of the Florida Republican Party, said he appreciated Trump “putting health and public safety first.”
“I know this was a difficult decision and just demonstrates and reaffirms once again his commitment to Jacksonville, the state of Florida and the people of the United States of America,” he said. “I’m grateful for him and his leadership, and this was the right way to move forward.”
Joe Gruters, current chair of the Florida Republican Party and a state senator from Sarasota, called it a “selfless move that he canceled.”
“Having our home-state candidate was going to be a really big deal for Florida, but listen, he had it right,” Gruters said. “At the end of the day, it’s about safety.”
More than 10,000 people were expected in Jacksonville — already a fraction of the number that would attend a normal convention. Only 336 delegates will be allowed to participate in Charlotte under extraordinary procedures approved last month by the Republican National Committee. The balance of the more than 2,500 delegates will vote by proxy.

The $1 trillion measure will provide aid for millions of Americans amid the pandemic. But with time running out, a final deal has yet to be reached. 
Months after the House passed a Democrat-led bill, the White House is set to make a major concession when Senate Republicans unveil their plan. 
Inching closer to a deal with Republicans on the next phase of a congressional rescue package, President Trump is prepared to give in on a payroll tax cut. 
After calling it ""very important"" Monday the President declared in a tweet Thursday that ""The Democrats have stated strongly that they won't approve a Payroll Tax Cut (too bad!)"" and signaled his readiness to move on without it in a Republican relief package estimated to hit $1 trillion.

""This is about kids and jobs,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin outside the White House. The bill is set to provide up to $25 billion for COVID-19 testing and up to $105 billion to schools. 
Mnuchin said the Republican plan would decrease the level of unemployment insurance set to run out this month. 
""This is intended to be wage replacement, so we're focused on the percentage which is about 70%, so nobody's going to get more than $600 but again if you were making $300, you're not going to get $600 this time,"" he said. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) countered that the GOP plan is too little too late.  
With those extra unemployment benefits set to run out next week, the clock is ticking. But whether leaving out the President's payroll tax cut will be enough to bring Democrats to the table remains to be seen. 
""What we have seen so far falls very short of the challenge that we face in order to defeat the virus in order to open our schools and to open our economy,"" Pelosi said. 
Democrats are insisting that any relief bill include hazard pay as well as food and rental assistance. 
Speaking on the Senate Floor Thursday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said, ""How about instead of shielding corporations from immunity, we shield renters from eviction?"" 
As to those grappling with adding to the deficit, the top House Republican signaled that a GOP bill is the lesser of two evils. 
""It's a real concern, the amount of debt we have, I watched as the Democrats wanted to spend 3 trillion,"" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA)

Traditional areas of civic agreement are vanishing. We can't agree on what makes America special. We can't even agree that America is special. We're coming to the point that we can't even agree what the word America itself means.
Political commentator Ben Shapiro points out that ""disintegrationists"" say we're stronger together, but their assault on America's history, philosophy, and culture will only tear us apart.

Venezuelan Warns US: Socialist Destruction Starts with Tearing Down Statues and Censoring Everything
Who are the disintegrationists? From Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States to the New York Times' ""1619 Project,"" many modern analyses view American history through the lens of competing oppressions, a racist and corrupt experiment from the very beginning. They see American philosophy as a lie – beautiful words pasted over a thoroughly rotted system. They see America's culture of rights as a façade that merely reinforces traditional hierarchies of power, instead of being the only culture that guarantees freedom for individuals.
To see Pat Robertson's full interview with Ben Shapiro about the book, How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps, click on the player above.
In an interview on Thursday's 700 Club, author Ben Shapiro explained the origins of the ""1619 Project."" 
""1619 is the date slaves arrived on American shores. And according to the New York Times and Nikole Hannah Jones, the de facto editor over there now, 1619 is the true founding of the United States. America is really not about the liberty of 1776, it's not about the history of Jamestown, it's not about Plymouth Rock,"" Shapiro said. ""America is really about slavery. All of the institutions of the United States are built on the bedrock of bigotry and racism and cruelty toward others and therefore the entire system must be torn down,"" he went on.
Disintegrationist attacks on the values that built our nation are insidious because they replace each foundational belief, from the rights to free speech and self-defense to the importance of marriage and faith communities, with nothing more than increased reliance on the government. 
Shapiro says the basic idea being touted is that the only good people who've ever lived are living right now. ""It's a very anti-Judeo Christian world view,"" he said. ""That human sin is only a product of the systems that human beings live in. That if you're Jewish or if you're Christian or if you believe the Judeo-Christian world view – if you're religious of any sort, actually – you tend to believe that human beings are endemically sinful, that human beings have the capacity for sin, and the fact that human beings have done bad things over the course of history is not always the result of a system,"" he said.
But that's not the way the disintegrationist Left sees the world. This twisted disintegrationist vision replaces the traditional ""unionist"" understanding that all Americans are united in a shared striving toward the perfection of universal ideals.
How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps shows that to be a cohesive nation we have to uphold foundational truths about ourselves, our history, and reality itself – to be unionists instead of disintegrationists. Shapiro offers a vital warning that if we don't recover these shared truths, our future – our union.

Biden included Islam as one of the ""great confessional faiths"" and said, ""I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith. I wish we talked about all the great confessional faiths. It's one of the great confessional faiths."" 
The online summit was hosted by Emgage Action, a political action group that endorsed Biden in April, and that hopes to turn out a million Muslim voters for Biden in November. A number of Muslim American officials, including Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, and Rep. Andre Carson (D-IN) signed a letter organized by Emgage Action endorsing Biden on Monday.

""We all come from the same root here in terms of our fundamental basic beliefs,"" Biden told the Muslim summit, ""and I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity, for being engaged, for committing to action this November.""  
But not everyone agrees that Islam should be lumped into the same so-called confessional-type faiths as Christianity and Judaism. One major concern is Islam's historic effort to dominate to the exclusion of all other religions. In a piece about the push to get Muslims elected to public office, published last week by Robert Spencer, he quotes the co-founder of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Omar Ahmad, as saying: ""Islam isn't in America to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran, the Muslim book of scripture, should be the highest authority in America, and Islam the only accepted religion on Earth.""
Spencer says when confronted about these words, Ahmad vehemently denied saying them. But Spencer writes that ""the original reporter, Lisa Gardiner of the Fremont Argus, hardly a hardline 'Islamophobe' with an axe to grind, stood by her story.""  What's more, he cites CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper who once said: ""I wouldn't want to create the impression that I wouldn't like the government of the United States to be Islamic sometime in the future.""
Meanwhile, Spencer writes, according to a captured internal document, ""the Muslim Brotherhood (to which all the major Muslim groups in the US, including CAIR, are linked) is dedicated in its own words to 'eliminating and destroying Western civilization from within, and sabotaging its miserable house….so that it falls, and Allah's religion is victorious over other religions'.""
Groups like CAIR encourage Muslim input into textbook selection and the shaping of Islamic curricula for the public schools, which only adds to many people's concerns about Biden's suggestion to broaden Islamic studies in America's schools. 
The American Center for Law and Justice, a religious liberty watchdog, reports numerous cases in recent years where teaching of Islam has moved from general knowledge of the religion to indoctrination of school children. On its website the ACLJ cites some assignments that have raised concern from parents, like middle-school children in Tennessee being told to write ""Allah is the only God"" and recite the Islamic conversion creed. An assignment in a Wisconsin public school told students to ""Pretend you are Muslim."" 
In Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on state curricula standards and how some teaching about various religions was being carried out. From the AJC report: ""It is important that students understand the differences between each of these religions to help them understand the tensions that exist in the region,"" the state standards, known as the Georgia Performance Standards, say.  In Walton County, which manifested itself in a homework assignment one parent found objectionable: ""Allah is the  (fill in the blank)  worshiped by Jews & Christians,"" the document said. The child was supposed to fill in the blank with ""same God.""  Historical Christianity does not teach that the Islamic ""Allah"" is the same God as Jesus Christ. But it is an example cited on CAIR's website as a fact of Islam that should be taught to students.
The ACLJ says there are reports across the country of  ""innocent school children being taught to pray Islamic prayers, make prayer rugs, and practice other Islamic rituals.""
 
Meanwhile, the ACLJ reports, Christian students are being told not to bring Bibles to school or to pray.
The goal of the Muslim Voters Summit is to rally one million Muslims to go to the polls this November to defeat Donald Trump.  The hope is to turn out voters in areas heavily populated by Muslims, like in Michigan where Trump won by less than 11,000 votes in 2016.
""You're doing what has never been done before. You're registering and turning out more than 1 million Muslim voters this November,"" Biden said. ""It matters."" 
Biden's senior adviser for Muslim engagement, Farooq Mitha, said earning the votes of Muslim Americans is a priority for Biden, pointing to multiple campaign events aimed at winning over Muslim voters.

Kids, jobs, and healthcare will be the focus of what could be the final round of COVID-19 relief packages. 
With cases of COVID-19 on the rise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced more than $100 billion for schools in the next relief bill. 
""This majority is preparing legislation that will send $105 billion dollars so that educators will have resources they need to safely reopen,"" McConnell said. ""That is more money than the House Democrats set aside for a similar fund.""

Other potential elements include another round of $1,200 payments going directly to Americans, a five-year liability shield for COVID-19 related lawsuits, money for targeted virus testing/tracking, and the payroll tax cut.
""The payroll tax, in particular, goes to some of our hardest working Americans the people that benefit if you look at the tax structure - middle and low-income workers,"" said White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. 
Democrats want the additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits to continue rather than expiring at the end of July. 
""We said the number one issue is we have to face the technical fix on enhanced unemployment,"" said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. ""We are going to make sure that we don't pay people more money to stay home then go to work."" 
In a letter to Senate Democrats, Minority Leader Charles Schumer wrote: ""Unfortunately, by all accounts, the Senate Republicans are drafting legislation that comes up short in a number of vital areas, such as extending unemployment benefits or funding for rental assistance, hazard premium pay for frontline workers, or investments in communities of color being ravaged by the virus, and many other necessary provisions.""
""This is going to be a major point of contention in the next couple of weeks as Donald Trump starts negotiating with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on this Phase 4 deal,"" said Economist Stephen Moore.

“Great day volunteering at the local DC Dream Center and distributing Farmers to Families Food Boxes to the last mile of need,” Ivanka tweeted. “This program is creating a link between hungry families and struggling farmers affected by COVID-19.”
The First Daughter helped load fresh produce, milk, and meat into 500 boxes.
She was joined by city and church leaders including Pastor Paula White.
“The Families have never received this quality of food and if you could see the smiles, the tears, the testimony, it makes a world a difference,” White said.
Farmers to Family Food Box announced it just reached 40 million boxes distributed for families affected by the pandemic.

But the Senate GOP and the White House are still negotiating about key points like more virus testing money. 
“We’ve made a lot of progress,” Trump said as the meeting got underway.
But the president acknowledged the “big flare-up” of rising caseloads and deaths in the states. “Unfortunately, this is something that’s very tough,” he said.
The GOP is expected to release a $1 trillion spending bill this week. One big issue: the $600 boost to weekly unemployment checks is set to expire this week. Democrats want to extend it, but Republicans will likely propose a cut.
The package from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been quietly crafted behind closed doors for weeks and was expected to include $75 billion to help schools reopen reduced unemployment benefits alongside a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans, and a sweeping five-year liability shield against coronavirus lawsuits.
McConnell and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy huddled with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and acting chief of staff Mark Meadows.

Mnuchin vowed passage by month’s end, as earlier benefits expire, and said he expected the fresh $1 trillion jolt of business tax breaks and other aid would have a “big impact” on the struggling economy.
Mnuchin said he’s preparing to start talks with Democrats. He and Meadows were headed to the Hill later to brief lawmakers.
“We can’t pass the bill in the Senate without the Democrats and we’re going to talk to them as well,” McConnell agreed.
There remains a wide gulf between the GOP and Democratic packages, with Democrats passing in the House a $3 trillion package, while the Republican package came in at about $1 trillion.
“We have to end this virus,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday on MSNBC.
Pelosi’s bill, approved in May, includes $75 billion for testing and tracing to try to get a handle on the virus spread, funnels $100 billion to schools to safely reopen and calls for $1 trillion for cash-strapped states to pay essential workers and prevent layoffs. The measure would give cash stipends to Americans, and bolster rental and mortgage and other safety net protections.
The political stakes are high for both parties before the November election, and even more so for the nation, which now has registered more coronavirus infections and a higher death count of 140,500 than any other country.
President Trump wants a liability shield so businesses can't be sued if people contract the virus, and he's determined to get a payroll tax cut.
""What about the payroll tax cut? I'd like to see it. I'd have to see it, but I'd consider not signing the bill if it doesn't have a payroll tax cut,"" Trump told Fox News.  
One point of contention, congressional Republicans have already proposed billions more in spending for testing and for the CDC and National Institutes of Health. The president, reportedly, is against it.
This would be the fifth virus aid package, after the $2.2 trillion bill passed in March, the largest US intervention of its kind.

The 87-year-old Ginsburg, who spent time in the hospital this week for a possible infection, said her treatment so far has succeeded in reducing lesions on her liver and that she will continue chemotherapy sessions every two weeks.
“I have often said I would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam. I remain fully able to do that,"" Ginsburg said in a statement issued by the court.
She said her recent hospitalizations, including one in May, were unrelated to the cancer.
A medical scan in February revealed growths on her liver, she said, and she began chemotherapy in May. 
“My most recent scan on July 7 indicated significant reduction of the liver lesions and no new disease,"" she said. “I am tolerating chemotherapy well and am encouraged by the success of my current treatment.""

He's replacing campaign manager Brad Parscale who had been increasingly sidelined in recent weeks. 
The move comes after a Trump political rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma last month which only drew 6,200 people after Parscale said more than a million people requested tickets.
Parscale will be replaced by veteran Republican operative Bill Stepien who served as field director for Trump's 2016 campaign. Parscale will reportedly continue working on the campaign, focusing more on the digital targeting of voters.

The staff change is not expected to change the day to day operations of the campaign.
Meanwhile, there's another possible concern for the Trump Campaign – the pandemic is reportedly taking a toll on the president's standing with voters. 
All polls need to be taken with a grain of salt since some voters are unlikely to voice their opinions in these divisive times, but the latest poll from Quinnipiac University shows his job approval slipping to 36 percent, giving Democrat rival Joe Biden a big lead. CBN's Chief Political Analyst David Brody points out the methodology of that Quinnipiac poll is questionable since it had a +10 Democrat differential. 
On the flip side, one recent poll showed 8 out of 10 evangelical voters say they still plan to vote for Trump. White evangelical Christian voters make up some of the president's most ardent supporters. 
That Pew Research Center survey shows approval for the president slipping among white evangelicals amid the COVID-19 pandemic and protests over racial injustice. But 82 percent of them still say they're leaning toward voting for the president in the November election.

Stitt Becomes First US Governor to Test Positive for COVID-19,"Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Wednesday that he's the first governor in the United States to test positive for the coronavirus and that he is isolating at home.
Stitt, 48, said he mostly feels fine, although he started feeling ""a little achy"" on Tuesday and sought a test. He said his wife and children were also tested Tuesday and that none of them have tested positive.
Stitt has backed one of the country's most aggressive reopening plans, resisted any statewide mandate on masks, and rarely wears one himself.
""We respect people's rights ... to not wear a mask,"" Stitt said during Wednesday's news conference, which was held virtually. ""You just open up a big can of worms.
""A lot of businesses are requiring it, and that's fine. I'm just hesitant to mandate something that I think is problematic to enforce,"" he said.

Stitt attended President Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa last month, but he said he's confident he didn't contract the virus at the rally.
""As far as where he became infected, it's really unknown,"" Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said. ""It wasn't so far back as the rally,"" which took place nearly a month ago.
Frye said contact tracing has begun in Stitt's case, with a particular emphasis on determining those who may have been within 6 feet of the governor for longer than 15 minutes.
On Tuesday morning, Stitt attended a meeting of the Commissioners of the Land Office in a conference room at the state capitol that was attended by more than 20 people.
Stitt said he has reached out to all of the people he spoke with during the meeting.
Stitt's announcement came as Oklahoma reported a second consecutive day of record-high numbers of confirmed new virus cases, with 1,075, bringing the statewide total to more than 22,000. The previous daily high was 993 confirmed cases on Tuesday. Health officials also confirmed four additional COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday, bringing the statewide death toll to 432.
Frye said there is still plenty of hospital capacity. 
While Stitt has resisted calls for a statewide mask mandate, several local municipalities have enacted one, including Norman and Stillwater. Tulsa's city council is expected to consider a mask mandate on Wednesday.

Newswatch is seen weekdays on the CBN News Channel.
Former college football coach Tommy Tuberville soundly defeated former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tuesday in the widely- watched runoff race for the Republican nomination for Session's old Senate seat in Alabama.
Sessions said in his concession speech that Republicans must stand behind Tuberville in November.
""I leave the elected office with my integrity intact,"" Sessions said, initially standing alone before his grandsons joined him in front of reporters. ""I hold my head high.""
Tuberville, 65, who had been the coach at Auburn University in Alabama until 2008, won with about 60 percent of the vote. The former coach has never held public office but comes to the political arena with a well-known brand. He embraces Trump and sells himself as an outsider, a conservative culture warrior. 
Tuberville took a strong stand against his Democratic opponent Tuesday, telling his supporters that he threatens Alabama with ""New York values.""
""Democrat Doug Jones is running for re-election on the slogan ""One - what means is one liberal Alabama and all the liberal left,"" he said. 
President Trump strongly supported Tuberville over Sessions.

Trump's press conference started out announcing he'd signed measures dealing with China.
""Today, I signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong,"" he said.
But he quickly switched over to slamming Biden's record there.
""As Vice President, Biden opposed tariffs. And he was standing up for China, didn't want to do anything to disrupt the relationship with China, even though China was taking us to the cleaners. He opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus,"" Trump continued.
Biden's press conference, meanwhile, was meant to announce his policy on climate change, but he too made sure to focus in on his rival.
""When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is hoax. When I think about climate change, the word I think of is jobs,"" Biden said.
Trump responded to Biden's climate change proposals by accusing him of going ""radical left"" and aligning his campaign with progressive leaders in the Democratic party.
""There's never been a time like this, where you've had an election of people so different,"" Trump said.

Donald Trump is right at the top of the list, but spiritually speaking he has someone even greater than the president to thank, namely Jesus Christ.
In January of this year, in the middle of all his legal troubles, Stone attended an outdoor prayer service in Florida led by Franklin Graham. Stone tells CBN News he was desperate, struggling and stressed out. Graham had met with him before the event and that night Stone made his move. 
""At that moment, I felt the calling,"" Stone says. ""I stood up with 500 other people. I wasn't the slightest bit embarrassed. I confess that I was a sinner. I repeated a pledge that he recited, and it was as if a cement block was lifted off my chest. I can't even explain it."" Stone says it gave him security about his future. ""I was never scared. I was never worried. I was completely confident that the Lord would guide the president to do the right thing.""
For decades, the provocateur enjoyed a reputation as the bad boy of politics. Then came convictions of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation into Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. 
""I don't regret anything that I did in 2016 because I didn't break the law,"" Stone tells CBN News. ""They wanted me to lie, to bear false witness against the president in return for some kind of leniency.""

Most political observers would expect Stone to be on the warpath against his enemies. But now, despite anger against prosecutors that he says were dishonest and politically motivated, Stone says he's on a new path. 
""Here's the big difference. In the old days, I would have wanted revenge. I would have wanted to take revenge against every one of them but now I've realized that vengeance is God's, it's not mine,"" he explained. 
Stone doesn't feel a need to go to his original playbook. ""I no longer am obsessed with the Sicilian concept of revenge, which generally speaking is a dish that tastes best when eaten cold,"" he added. 
Still, Stone couldn't resist putting what he's been through in spiritual terms. ""I really do believe that those who are trying to undo this president, those who are trying to destroy me, trying to destroy Michael Flynn, who's a very good man and great American patriot war hero, I do believe they're satanic,"" he said. 
Stone wasn't done. ""They cut corners and what's outrageous is their arrogance, their moral superiority, when in fact, they have no morals at all,"" he said. ""I don't believe that any of these people involved in my prosecution are really believers in God."" 
CBN News reached out to former members of the Office of the Special Counsel about Stone's satanic remark. A spokesman declined to comment.
Meanwhile, you can be sure that Stone won't be declining comment as he moves forward with his life. 
""I can guarantee you I don't intend to become boring,"" he says. As for regrets, he has them. ""I do regret the fact that it took this long for me to return to the church because I realized that I could have had the solitude and the solace and the strength and the fortitude to fight this much earlier. I went through a year of hell before I found the way."" Will he now find the way to do the hard task the Bible requires of praying for his enemies  ""The Lord will deal with them so it's not like they will go unpunished. That makes it easier to pray for them for when that moment comes.""
As for Stone's immediate future, he wants to help re-elect President Trump, this time from his perch on the outside. As for his purpose going forward, he's waiting on God. ""I think God put me in this position at this time for a purpose,"" Stone tells CBN News. ""So if God has a mission for me, He hasn't revealed it to me yet, but if He does, I'm ready for duty.""

Trump Denies Federal Aid to Minnesota After Democrats Failed to Stop Rioting
At a White House law enforcement roundtable on Monday, President Trump criticized city leaders who want to de-fund the police at a time when inner-city crime is soaring. 
Trump said what he called ""radical politicians"" running America's cities are  ""waging war on innocent Americans,"" and that his administration is ""pro-police and anticrime. ""
""You look at what's going on in Minneapolis, you look at what's going on in many, many Democrat run-areas. But they want to de-fund and they want to abolish. Far-left mayors are escalating the anti-cop crusade and violent crime is spiraling in their cities,"" Trump said.

President Trump has come under fire for denying a request from Minnesota's governor for federal funds to rebuild parts of Minneapolis that were destroyed during the George Floyd riots. More than 1,500 buildings were damaged by looting and rioting, resulting in over $500 million in damages.
But it's not without precedent. In 2015, the Obama White House denied aid to the state of Maryland after rioting in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died in police custody. 
In Seattle, WA, the city council wants to cut the police budget in half. The mayor says that's too much. Jenny Durkan complained that the city council hadn't even consulted with Police Chief Carmen Best, who said, ""It is reckless to advocate for this kind of cut.""
But Mayor Durken still wants a 20 percent cut, totaling some $96 million dollars.
President Trump pointed out that in New York City, shootings were up 358 percent, and he said the city of Chicago was more dangerous than Afghanistan and a time when police have been demonized.
""Reckless politicians have defamed our law enforcement heroes as the enemy. They call them 'the enemy.' They actually go and say, 'they're the enemy, and even call them an invading army.'"" 
CBN News chief political correspondent David Brody told CBN's Faith Nation program that President Trump's law and order emphasis will resonate with most voters in this falls election. 
""Most people in this country want to feel safe, most people think police are doing good out there, and that's where this president is trying to take the conversation because he believes electorally and politically that that's a winning hand, in terms of the safety of the American people, come November,"" Brody said. 
President Trump vowed that crime numbers will go down even if he has to ""go in and take over cities.""  
That law and order message may be working. Recent polls show he's cut Joe Biden's lead in half.

A conservative lawmaker from South Carolina praised Trump’s ultimate decision to deny the request for taxpayer dollars.
Great news! @realDonaldTrump has DENIED Minnesota's disaster request to repair half a billion dollars in damage from the riots. Governors and Mayors who ordered police to stand down and watch their cities burn shouldn't get a penny in taxpayer aid! https://t.co/8WAgm7AFa7

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) ordered the police to stand down as the city literally went up in flames. Even as rioters torched the Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd Precinct, law enforcement officers abandoned it and let it burn.
The New York Times described one night of mayhem this way:
As the night wore on, dozens of buildings burst into flames, without a fire crew in sight. A six-story apartment building that was still under construction collapsed into a ball of fire. A high-tech factory was set ablaze. Residents called 911 desperate for help, but dispatchers were overwhelmed.
Over three nights, a five-mile stretch of Minneapolis sustained extraordinary damage. The police precinct house itself was set on fire, after the mayor age orders to evacuate the building. A month later the city is still struggling to understand what happened and why: Not since the 1992 unrest in Los Angeles has an American city suffered such destructive riots.
In addition, progressive politicians in Minneapolis have repeatedly ridiculed law enforcement offices and have vowed to dismantle the city’s police department — even as violent crime continues to surge.
Asked by CNN what Minneapolis residents should do if their homes are broken into and there are no police officers to call, City Council President Lisa Bender said, “Yes, I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors, and I know, and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege because, for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality, where calling the police may mean more harm is done.”
CAMEROTA: ""What if in the middle of the night my home is broken into. Who do I call?""

Stone had been convicted and sentenced to three years and four months in prison for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstructing the House investigation.  
Friday evening, the White House issued a statement shredding Robert Mueller's Russia probe and explaining the decision to commute Stone's sentence. Stone wasn't officially pardoned, but his prison sentence has been erased:
Statement from the White House Press Secretary Regarding Executive Grant of Clemency for Roger Stone, Jr.
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency commuting the unjust sentence of Roger Stone, Jr. 
 
Roger Stone is a victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency.  There was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign, or the Trump Administration, with Russia.  Such collusion was never anything other than a fantasy of partisans unable to accept the result of the 2016 election.  The collusion delusion spawned endless and farcical investigations, conducted at great taxpayer expense, looking for evidence that did not exist.  As it became clear that these witch hunts would never bear fruit, the Special Counsel's Office resorted to process-based charges leveled at high-profile people in an attempt to manufacture the false impression of criminality lurking below the surface.  These charges were the product of recklessness borne of frustration and malice. 
 
This is why the out-of-control Mueller prosecutors, desperate for splashy headlines to compensate for a failed investigation, set their sights on Mr. Stone.  Roger Stone is well known for his nearly 50 years of work as a consultant for high-profile Republican politicians, including President Ronald Reagan, Senator Bob Dole, and many others.  He is also well known for his outspoken support for President Donald J. Trump and opposition to Hillary Clinton. 
 
Mr. Stone was charged by the same prosecutors from the Mueller Investigation tasked with finding evidence of collusion with Russia.  Because no such evidence exists, however, they could not charge him for any collusion-related crime.  Instead, they charged him for his conduct during their investigation.  The simple fact is that if the Special Counsel had not been pursuing an absolutely baseless investigation, Mr. Stone would not be facing time in prison.
 
In addition to charging Mr. Stone with alleged crimes arising solely from their own improper investigation, the Mueller prosecutors also took pains to make a public and shameful spectacle of his arrest.  Mr. Stone is a 67-year-old man, with numerous medical conditions, who had never been convicted of another crime.  But rather than allow him to surrender himself, they used dozens of FBI agents with automatic weapons and tactical equipment, armored vehicles, and an amphibious unit to execute a pre-dawn raid of his home, where he was with his wife of many years.  Notably, CNN cameras were present to broadcast these events live to the world, even though they swore they were not notified—it was just a coincidence that they were there together with the FBI early in the morning. 
 
Not only was Mr. Stone charged by overzealous prosecutors pursuing a case that never should have existed, and arrested in an operation that never should have been approved, but there were also serious questions about the jury in the case.  The forewoman of his jury, for example, concealed the fact that she is a member of the so-called liberal ""resistance"" to the Trump Presidency.  In now-deleted tweets, this activist-juror vividly and openly attacked President Trump and his supporters. 
 
Mr. Stone would be put at serious medical risk in prison.  He has appealed his conviction and is seeking a new trial.  He maintains his innocence and has stated that he expects to be fully exonerated by the justice system.  Mr. Stone, like every American, deserves a fair trial and every opportunity to vindicate himself before the courts.  The President does not wish to interfere with his efforts to do so.  At this time, however, and particularly in light of the egregious facts and circumstances surrounding his unfair prosecution, arrest, and trial, the President has determined to commute his sentence.  Roger Stone has already suffered greatly.  He was treated very unfairly, as were many others in this case.  Roger Stone is now a free man!

The Becket Fund attorney and author of Free to Believe: The Battle Over Religious Liberty in America sees this most recent term that just wrapped up as one filled with tremendous wins, but notes one decision that forms a dark cloud for people of faith in the days and years ahead.
“Considering that my firm, the Becket Fund, just got two huge victories from the Supreme Court Wednesday, I’m feeling really great about the term, on the whole. But not every case was uniformly positive,” he told CBN News.
The Faithful, Not the Government, Should Control Who Teaches the Faith

Supreme Court Says Employers Can't Be Forced to Violate Their Pro-Life Religious Beliefs
Supreme Court Rules Government Can't Tell Religious Schools Who to Hire and Fire
Top of his mind, though, were those clear wins. One was the 7-to-2 affirmation by the high court that institutions like churches and religious schools should be allowed to pick who’ll teach the faith and pass it on, unencumbered by government intrusion.   
Two teachers who’d been let go by two Roman Catholic schools in California sued, claiming discrimination. But the Court unambiguously ruled their hiring and firing by the schools was covered under the “ministerial exception” – the legal doctrine that states those of the faith should be in charge of who ministers the faith.
But the case the Court took up that gave Goodrich particular joy? “The long-running battle of the Little Sisters of the Poor,” he said.
“About seven years ago during the Obama administration, the government issued a regulation that would require most organizations to include contraception and abortion-causing drugs in their health insurance plans,” Goodrich explained.  
Obey & Sear Their Conscience or Disobey & Face Devastating Fines
But the Little Sisters, an order of Catholic nuns who devote their lives to caring for the elderly poor, took the new regulation to court. Because, on one hand, their collective conscience forbade them to have anything to do with threatening unborn lives, so morally they couldn’t comply with that regulation. And, on the other hand, if they refused to comply, they would face fines of something like 70 to 75 million dollars a year – a sure death blow to their ministry.
Goodrich said of Becket and the nuns, “We went up to the Supreme Court once. And the Court basically told the government ‘surely you can find a way to provide access to contraception without Catholic nuns.’ And then the Trump administration issued a good rule that protected the Little Sisters of the Poor. That should have been the end of the matter.”
But it wasn’t. As the attorney and author explained, “Unfortunately the state of Pennsylvania then challenged the religious protection for the Sisters. And that went all the way up to the Supreme Court. And Wednesday, the Supreme Court in a 7-to-2 ruling, said that the government had authority to exempt the Little Sisters and to protect them from the contraception mandate. So that was a great win.”
What Could Force the Nuns to Go Through All This Again
What the Little Sisters now must consider is how a change in the White House could take them right back to Court.
Goodrich noted, “Vice President Biden said Thursday he was contemplating reverting back to the old Obamacare regulation. But the good thing about Wednesday’s decision: two justices argued that doing that would be a clear violation of religious freedom protections. And even in the majority opinion, there are a number of bread crumbs, so to speak, or foreshadowings that reimposing that old mandate would probably be an uphill battle. So maybe we’re not fully out of the woods yet. But Wednesday was a great, great victory for the Little Sisters of the Poor.”
The Radical Redefining of 'Sex'
On the flip side, the high court’s June ruling in the Bostock case radically redefined what “sex” means. It presents potential problems of a huge legal nature as the Court has now made firing homosexuals or transgenders sex discrimination.
“The Supreme Court decided a trio of cases under the name of Bostock on the question of sex discrimination in employment. And the Court adopted a sort of odd interpretation of federal employment discrimination law,” Goodrich said.
This huge change applies to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin.
The Dark Cloud: Bostock ‘Could Greenlight a Lot More Lawsuits’
“The new bottom line means that individuals can sue their employers, alleging either sexual orientation discrimination or gender identity discrimination,” Goodrich explained. “And for religious organizations…there are tens of thousands of religious organizations across the country that expect their employees to uphold their religious teachings about human sexuality. So, in one sense, Bostock could greenlight a lot more lawsuits by former employees against religious employers.”
That’s the dark cloud Goodrich sees. 
“But the silver lining of the Bostock decision majority opinion noted there are very important religious protections for religious employers. It cited three,” the lawyer stated.  
“One is a religious exemption in Title VII that says religious groups can make religious decisions in hiring and firing. So that’s very strong protection. The second was the ministerial exception, which we just won a huge victory on that for Catholic schools Wednesday,” Goodrich noted. “And then the third is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was at issue in the Little Sisters of the Poor case.”  
“So certainly Bostock opens the door to a number of lawsuits that could be troubling to religious organizations,” admitted Goodrich. “But there are still very strong protections for religious organizations. And I’m very optimistic that the Supreme Court will recognize the right and authority of religious groups to hire and fire in accordance with their religious mission.”"

In an exclusive interview with CBN News, Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said three drug candidates are in the final stage of human trials. 
""We are making all of those vaccines even though we don't know if they work yet so even when we get that first signal that its safe and it works then we'll have doses that can really start by going to the most at risk,"" Birx explained. 
The US is doing 600,000 COVID-19 tests a day. As a result, for the first time, Dr. Birx said they're able to see the full spectrum of the disease. 
""We also have to remember that we've become better at treating individuals with COVID in the hospitals,"" Birx noted.

Treatments like Remdesivir and certain steroids have proven effective in treating the virus. Birx advises states seeing spikes, like California, Florida, and Texas to put the brakes on reopening. 
The attention has now shifted to places of worship. 
""Do you consider churches to be a source for spreading COVID-19,"" CBN News asked. 
""Any gathering indoors is a potential spreading event but there has to be virus there,"" Birx replied. 
Some churches located in hot spots are closing their doors once again and turning back to virtual services, especially with studies pointing to the potential for airborne transmission of the virus. 
""If churches would move outside which the weather is beautiful and social distance outside, we know that is much safer if they would wear masks that is much safer,"" Birx added.  
Birx said the US government could have the answer on antibodies by early fall. She recommends that people who have recovered from COVID-19 donate plasma which could be critical to those fighting the virus.

Stony Brook University Prof. Helmut Norpoth revealed the result to the website Mediaite. 
Norpoth's model predicted Trump would win in 2016, even when the polls seemed to indicate the opposite.

The university reported back in 2016, ""Based on his analysis of primary voting, Norpoth gave Trump an 87%-99% chance of beating Hillary Clinton nearly one year ago. He stuck by his model in press interviews despite an overwhelming consensus of pollsters and pundits promising a Clinton victory.""
His model would have correctly predicted 25 of the last 27 elections, and it says President Trump has a 91 percent chance of being reelected.
The model also indicates the president could win a bigger majority in the Electoral College this time than he did in 2016.

The professor said his model emphasizes how much enthusiasm candidates generate early in the nominating process, discounting the opinion polls.
So far, polls have shown Biden leading over Trump. But the professor pointed out that many candidates have led in the polls in the spring but lost in the fall. 
""The terrain of presidential contests is littered with nominees who saw a poll lead in the spring turn to dust in the fall,"" Norpoth said.
There's still a long way to go before Election Day, and polls can change a lot, especially after the candidates hold their nominating conventions and presidential debates.
And while the Biden camp has said he will engage in three debates with Trump, critics are wondering if they'll really allow that to happen, pointing to numerous gaffes that they say raise questions about his mental abilities, including this latest clip:

The ruling returns the case to lower courts, with no clear prospect for when the case might ultimately be resolved.
The 7-2 outcome is at least a short-term victory for Trump, who has strenuously sought to keep his financial records private. 
The decision came after the court upheld a prosecutor’s demand for Trump’s tax returns as part of a criminal investigation that includes hush-money payments to women who claim they had affairs with Trump.
The court ruled 7-2 in a case in which it heard arguments by telephone in May because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The records are held by Trump’s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, which has said it would comply with a court order.
It probably will be at least several weeks before the court issues a formal judgment that would trigger the turnover of the records.
The court rejected arguments by Trump’s lawyers and the Justice Department that the president is immune from investigation while he holds office or that a prosecutor must show a greater need than normal to obtain the records.
Trump’s two high court appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined the majority.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) is calling for the “dismantling” of the American political and economic system, in addition to upending the criminal justice system.
“As long as our economy and political systems prioritize profit without considering who is profiting, who is being shut out, we will perpetuate this inequality,” she explained during a press event Tuesday in Minnesota. “We cannot stop at [the] criminal justice system. We must begin the work of dismantling the whole system of oppression.”
The 37-year-old lawmaker didn’t specify what, exactly, she means by “dismantling.” The dictionary definition of the word, though, is, “to disconnect the pieces of,” or, “to destroy the integrity or functioning of.”

“You can’t really reform a department that is rotten to the root,” she said at the time. “What you can do is rebuild, and so this is our opportunity.”

On Tuesday, Omar said dismantling police departments, though, just doesn’t go far enough.

The US Supreme Court is upholding religious exemptions for pro-life employers who don't want to be forced to provide contraception, including abortion-inducing drugs, to their employees.
In an overwhelming 7-2 ruling on Wednesday morning, the court sided with the Trump administration which had taken steps to allow employers with religious convictions to be exempt from the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare.

'Ridiculous': States Tell Supreme Court to Force Nuns to Violate Their 'God-Given Right of Conscience'
States Trying to Force Nuns to Fund Abortion: Pro-Life Little Sisters of the Poor at Supreme Court Yet Again
SCOTUS blog first reported the religious freedom victory by tweeting: ""#SCOTUS upholds expanded exemptions to the Affordable Care Act's birth control mandate for employers with religious or moral objections""
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, ""We hold today that the Departments had the statutory authority to craft that exemption, as well as the contemporaneously issued moral exemption. We further hold that the rules promulgating these exemptions are free from procedural defects.""
The case revolved around a group of nuns called Little Sisters of the Poor that was fighting back against the contraception mandate, saying it violated their religious beliefs. The nuns had fought the case and won before, but then the state of Pennsylvania tried again to force them to violate their pro-life beliefs.
Thomas continued in his ruling, ""For over 150 years, the Little Sisters have engaged in faithful service and sacrifice, motivated by a religious calling to surrender all for the sake of their brother... But for the past seven years, they—like many other religious objectors who have participated in the litigation and rulemakings leading up to today's decision— have had to fight for the ability to continue in their noble work without violating their sincerely held religious beliefs.""  
Each of the Little Sisters of the Poor has taken a vow to care for the elderly poor, which they do in facilities across the country. One of their Mother Superiors, Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, said, ""We could not comply with the mandate. To do so would undermine our most important belief, that all life is valuable. We cannot hold the hands of the elderly dying while at the same time facilitating the ending of unborn life.""
""America deserves better than petty governments harassing nuns. The Court did the right thing by protecting the Little Sisters from an unnecessary mandate that would have gutted their ministry,"" said Mark Rienzi, president of Becket, which fought the legal battle for the nuns.
""Governments don't need nuns to distribute contraceptives. But they do need religious groups to care for the elderly, heal the sick and feed the hungry. These governments all have real work they ought to be doing rather than dividing people with old and unnecessary culture wars,"" Rienzi said.

School districts are running into problems with parents who need to work full time as they debate if children will return to their desks full or part-time. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden wants to protect teachers and make sure they don't get fired or have their salaries cut due to a school's decision for kids to stay at home. 
""We could have kept every educator employed, but instead, we lost more than 900,000 state and local education jobs since the pandemic started due to budget cuts,"" Biden said. ""This is absolutely unacceptable. We are already short the number of teachers we need nationally.""
On the higher education level, universities like Harvard have already announced they will go entirely remote in the fall. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out guidance for schools last month, including staggering schedules, spreading out desks, having meals in classrooms instead of the cafeteria, adding physical barriers between bathroom sinks and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces.
Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the CDC, said schools can operate safely by taking basic safety precautions. He noted that COVID-19 cases tend to be milder in young people, adding that the greatest risk is the transmission from children to more vulnerable populations. But he also believes it's damaging to young people to not allow them to return to school.
""It's clear that the greater risk to our society is to have these schools close,"" Redfield said. ""The CDC encourages all schools to do what they need to reopen, and to have plans that anticipate that COVID-19 cases will in fact occur.""

But is it enough to hurt him come November? New research seems to indicate – not really.
According to a Pew Research Center survey out this week, among white evangelicals President Trump still has a 72-percent approval rating. That's a drop of six percent since April. 
But even with that slip, 82-percent of white evangelicals still say they're leaning toward voting for the president in the November election. All polls need to be taken with a grain of salt since some voters are unlikely to voice their opinions in these divisive times, but Pew does have a pretty good track record.
CBN News Chief Political Analyst David Brody says the poll indicates President Trump lost a little bit of support partly because of the George Floyd aftermath, including the Bible photo incident in front of St. John's Church across the street from the White House.
The recent Supreme Court ruling that redefined ""sex"" to include LGBT ideology may have also disheartened some conservatives because one of Trump's Supreme Court picks, Justice Neil Gorsuch, sided with the more liberal justices.
But that ruling also may fuel evangelicals to consider that several more Supreme Court nominees could be at stake in the coming years, and they could flip the balance of the court in one way or the other.

Meanwhile, only 17 percent of white evangelicals are saying they'll back the Democrat's presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden. 
President Trump won the 2016 election with 81 percent of the white evangelical vote. Brody says, this time around, ""Donald Trump has to be north of 81 percent (to win) – 82 percent is a little too close for comfort. He's probably gotta be up close to 83, 84 or 85 percent"". He says if Trump achieves 84 or 85 percent of that support ""it's over – he wins a second term.""
""The road to the White House goes through evangelicals - the Trump administration knows it,"" Brody said.
Meanwhile, majorities in other Christian groups also still support President Trump. He scored a 56% approval rating among non-evangelical white Protestants in June and 54% approval among white Catholics.

But why do they want to drop Columbus Day at the same time?  
Fox News reports US Sens. Ron Johnson (R-WI) and James Lankford (R-OK) introduced their proposed amendment to bipartisan legislation led by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) in June that would make Juneteenth (June 19) a federal holiday.  The bill has 51 co-sponsors.
At issue, every federal holiday costs the government $600 million in paid leave for government workers, according to the two senators.   
""In response to a bipartisan effort to give federal workers another day of paid leave by designating Juneteenth a federal holiday, we have offered a counterproposal that does not put us further in debt,"" Johnson, a budget hawk, said in a statement. ""We support celebrating emancipation with a federal holiday, but believe we should eliminate a current holiday in exchange. We chose Columbus Day as a holiday that is lightly celebrated, and least disruptive to Americans' schedules.""
Johnson said he's ""happy to celebrate the emancipation with a national holiday, but I just don't think we should be, when we're already blowing a hole in the budget right now, offering another paid day off for federal employees.""
Lankford agrees that Juneteenth needs to be remembered. He also believes Congress needs to subtract a holiday due to the financial cost of adding to the total number of federal holidays. 
""Juneteenth is a day in our history that redefined the meaning of freedom and equality in America,"" Lankford said. ""Throughout our history, we have strived to become a more perfect union and Juneteenth was a huge step in attaining that goal."" 
""We should celebrate these strides on the federal level while remaining cognizant of the impact the existing 10 federal holidays have on federal services and local businesses. We can reduce these impacts by replacing Columbus Day as a federal holiday with Juneteenth, America's second independence day. I'm hopeful the Senate will support this amendment to celebrate this significant day in our nation's history,"" Lankford continued.
Cornyn, however, sees swapping Columbus Day for Juneteenth as ""problematic.""  He contends that cutting Columbus Day would alienate Italian Americans who have long celebrated the day for the Italian explorer who has long been credited as the discoverer of New World. 
""I think that's problematic,"" he told The Hill of the Johnson counteroffer. ""We're working through all those things right now, we just don't have an answer right this second.""
Meanwhile, protestors across the nation have set their sights on toppling and vandalizing statues of Christopher Columbus, who some say ""represents genocide"" as Spanish soldiers or conquistadors and others followed, conquering and enslaving all of the indigenous people inhabiting both North and South America. Some have moved for an ""Indigenous Peoples' Day,"" to replace Columbus Day. 
The city of Columbus, Ohio, took down its statue of the explorer on Wednesday. 
Juneteenth is commemorated on June 19 - the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas with the news that President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing all slaves in the Confederate states in 1863.  
The holiday is currently recognized in 47 states.

Mallory Quigley with the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List told CBN News, ""What we have today is a bitterly disappointing decision, especially on the part of the Chief Justice for his flip-flop.""
Louisiana Right to Life Executive Director Benjamin Clapper agreed. ""We're disappointed in today's decision and we're disappointed in Justice Roberts, who chose for the abortion facilities and their interests over protecting the health and safety of women.""

The Louisiana law is similar to a Texas law that the Court struck down four years ago. Back then, Chief Justice John Roberts was for the anti-abortion Texas law. But now he's flipped, saying the Texas decision is a controlling precedent. He wrote that the new ruling is ""...controlled by (the Court's) decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law.""  
Regent Law Professor Brad Jacob spoke of Roberts' helping to kill the Louisiana law when not all that long ago he'd backed the Texas law. 
""He said in that case, 'this is wrong – the Constitution does not require us to strike down a law requiring admitting privileges in a hospital.'  (Monday) he said, 'even though I still think that opinion is wrong, I'm going to follow it.'   And so he followed the precedent that he himself said is wrong,"" explained the incredulous Professor Jacob.
The White House weighed in against the Court's ruling, saying in a statement, ""...unelected justices have intruded on the sovereign prerogatives of state governments by imposing their own policy preference in favor of abortion to override legitimate safety regulations.""

Justice Clarence Thomas in his dissent bludgeoned his fellow justices. He said none of the Court's pro-abortion decisions are supported by the US Constitution.  He labeled them ""a creation that should be undone.""
He went right after the Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortion legal nationwide and the rulings that followed it, writing, ""Despite the readily apparent illegitimacy of Roe, the Court has doggedly adhered to (it's core holding) again and again, often to disastrous ends.""
Thomas also wrote, ""Abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled.""
Professor Jacob backed Thomas, saying of the pro-choice justices, ""Their job is to apply the words, the original meaning of the United States Constitution.  And if there's an earlier opinion that is wrong, and they knowingly follow the earlier wrong opinion – follow precedent instead of following the Constitution itself – I think they've violated their oath of office.  I think they have acted unconstitutionally.""
Meanwhile, many are asking is the Court actually all that conservative? What this decision and several others show is that the conservative majority court-watchers thought would now hold sway may not be real.  
Chief Justice Roberts was once thought to be a fairly firm conservative vote.  But he has sided repeatedly with the four more liberal justices. When he does it on an issue as precious to conservatives as abortion, it means probably every issue is up in the air.   "

The tweet no longer appears on the president's timeline, and the White House claims he did not hear the ""white power"" chant that came eight seconds into the video.
On Sunday morning, Republican Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) quickly called for the tweet to be removed.
""I think it's indefensible. We should take it down,"" Scott told CNN's State of the Union.
The video was on the president's timeline for about three hours before he un-shared it, but without an apology or a denouncement of the video's message. 
On Monday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany offered this explanation of the situation.
""The president did not hear that phrase in that portion of the video, and when it was signaled to him that it was in there, he took that tweet down,"" McEnany told Fox and Friends.
Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized the president with his own tweet, saying: ""White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history – not promoted by the president of the United States.""
Also, over the weekend in Mississippi, the long-fought battle to remove the last confederate symbol remaining on a state flag was finally won in both the House and Senate and celebrated by members on both sides of the aisle.
""By a vote of 37 to 14 the bill passes,"" declared Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, (R-MI) to a cheering crowd. 
Mississippi's Republican Governor Tate Reeves says he will sign the bill as soon as it gets to his desk, and voters in the state will approve a new flag design in November's election that must include the words ""in God we trust"".

0,2020-06-29T11:15:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2020/june/supreme-court-strikes-down-louisiana-abortion-law-that-was-meant-to-protect-womens-health,Supreme Court Strikes Down Louisiana Abortion Law that Was Meant to Protect Women's Health,"The US Supreme Court announced Monday it's overturning a Louisiana law that required abortion doctors in the state to have hospital admitting privileges. The law had been created to ensure the health and safety of women who face emergencies after abortions. 
In the 5-4 ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts joined with his four liberal colleagues on the high court to elevate abortion rights once again.
For pro-life women, this law was all about protecting the safety of other women. Outside the Court, Prudence Robertson of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List said, ""This Supreme Court has decided to strike down a law that protects the safety of women and protects children from the tragedy of abortion.""
And Catherine Foster of Americans United for Life said, ""It's tragic because we have this largely unregulated field where women are getting injured, women are getting killed.""
She continued, ""When an abortion goes wrong — and we all know that they do, tragically wrong — women who've sought that abortion still deserve the same emergency care as any other woman.""
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the dissent against the ruling, “Today a majority of the Court perpetuates its ill-founded abortion jurisprudence by enjoining a perfectly legitimate state law and doing so without jurisdiction.”
Trump’s two appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined Thomas in dissenting, along with Justice Samuel Alito.
That led Mallory Quigley of the Susan B. Anthony List to say CBN News' Faith Nation, ""We know now that the president's two appointed justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, they came down on the right side and that they're going to stand with pro-lifers.  So that is encouraging.""
This was the first big abortion case since Trump became president, and it's likely to fuel pro-life voters heading into the 2020 election, when many hope the balance of the Supreme Court can finally be shifted pro-life.
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins was among the many pro-life advocates who were shocked and deeply disappointed in the decision.
  
""For too long, abortionists have flouted the law and derided health standards for women seeking abortion. As a Louisiana legislator, I authored one of the first abortion clinic regulations in the country to stop abortion clinics from operating in filthy, disgusting, unregulated conditions,"" Perkins said. ""Unfortunately, in Louisiana and elsewhere these facilities have shown minimal concern for the well-being of women as many continued performing abortions in marginal conditions that put lives at risk as they falsify records to cover up their malpractice. With this decision, the Supreme Court has prevented Louisiana from enforcing the law to stop abortionists who regularly deride and violate health standards for women seeking abortion.""
National Institute of Family and Life Advocates President and Founder Thomas Glessner stated his disappointment with the ruling, too.
""Women seeking abortions have the same right to competent and quality care as patients involved in other surgical procedures. This ruling allows the loophole enjoyed by abortionists to remain open at the expense of the women the abortion industry claims to serve,"" he said.
The justices wiping the law out wrote, “Louisiana's law poses a ‘substantial obstacle’ to women seeking an abortion...the law offers no significant health-related benefits...the law consequently imposed an ‘undue burden’ on a woman’s constitutional right to choose to have an abortion.”
The Louisiana law is similar to a Texas law that the Court struck down four years ago.   Back then, Chief Justice John Roberts was for the anti-abortion Texas law.  But now he flipped, saying the Texas decision is a controlling precedent. He wrote the new ruling is, ""...controlled by (the Court's) decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law.""  
Regent Law Professor Brad Jacob spoke of Roberts' helping to kill the Louisiana law when not all that long ago he'd backed the Texas law. 
""He said in that case, 'this is wrong -- the Constitution does not require us to strike down a law requiring admitting privileges in a hospital.'  Today he said, 'even though I still think that opinion is wrong, I’m going to follow it.'   And so he followed the precedent that he himself said is wrong,"" explained the incredulous Professor Jacob.
Quigley said, “What we have today is a bitterly disappointing decision, especially on the part of the Chief Justice for his flip-flop.”
Louisiana Right to Life Executive Director Benjamin Clapper lamented, “We’re disappointed in today’s decision and we’re disappointed in Justice Roberts, who chose for the abortion facilities and their interests over protecting the health and safety of women.”
The dissenting justices argued that the law really does provide health and safety benefits for women.   Louisiana lawmakers said it's why they wrote the law.   Indeed, they were reacting to the actions of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell.  He was convicted of manslaughter involving a patient who died in his care while he was operating what investigators called a ""house of horrors.""
Clapper's Louisiana Right to Life helped those lawmakers write the law, which had overwhelming support among lawmakers and the public.   Clapper told CBN News, ""We introduced this legislation in 2014 to close the loophole that allows abortion facilities to operate at a lower standard of care.""
Democratic State Senator Katrina Jackson, the main advocate for the law in Louisiana's Senate, said, “Once again, unelected justices have substituted their policy preferences over the clear will of the people of my great state.   As long as the Supreme Court continues to meddle in an area that rightfully belongs in the democratic process, women will remain subject to substandard abortion facilities.”
The White House weighed in against the Court’s ruling, saying in a statement ""...unelected justices have intruded on the sovereign prerogatives of state governments by imposing their own policy preference in favor of abortion to override legitimate safety regulations.""
Clarence Thomas in his dissent bludgeoned his fellow justices.   He said none of the Court’s pro-abortion decisions are supported by the U.S. Constitution.  He labeled them ""a creation that should be undone.""
He went right after the Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortion legal nationwide and the rulings that followed it, writing, “Despite the readily apparent illegitimacy of Roe, the Court has doggedly adhered to (it’s core holding) again and again, often to disastrous ends.”
Thomas also wrote, ""Abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled.""
Professor Jacob backed Thomas, saying of the pro-choice justices, “Their job is to apply the words, the original meaning of the United States Constitution.  And if there's an earlier opinion that is wrong, and they knowingly follow the earlier wrong opinion -- follow precedent instead of following the Constitution itself -- I think they've violated their oath of office.  I think they have acted unconstitutionally.""
However, Ilyse Hogue of the pro-abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America stated, “...even a Court tilted so far right couldn’t ignore the concrete arguments and data showing that public health is compromised by these burdensome restrictions on abortion.”
But now many are asking is the Court actually all that conservative?   What this decision and several others show is that the conservative majority court-watchers thought would now hold sway may not be real.  Chief Justice Roberts was once thought to be a fairly firm conservative vote.  But he has sided repeatedly with the four more liberal justices.   When he does it on an issue as precious to conservatives as abortion, it means probably every issue is up in the air.

Since the death of George Floyd, rioters have unleashed their anger by destroying the statues of men who represent American history such as President George Washington, Christopher Columbus, and President Ulysses S. Grant.
The order reinforces laws that criminalize the destruction of public monuments, vandalism toward religious property, and will withhold federal support from state and local agencies that fail to stop the desecration.

""Under this Order, the Federal Government is directed to prosecute any person or entity that damages or defaces religious property and withhold certain Federal support from State and local governments that fail to protect public monuments, memorials, and statues from destruction or vandalism,"" the order states.
Trump's announcement comes as protesters tried to tear down a monument of Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States, in a park located near the White House before police stopped them. 
Besides the Jackson statue, additional acts of vandalism have occurred at St. John's Church, also across the street from the White House, the Lincoln Memorial, and the World War II Memorial.
The president tweeted that vandals would be subject to periods of imprisonment for committing such acts of violence against our country.
""I just had the privilege of signing a very strong Executive Order protecting American Monuments, Memorials, and Statues - and combatting recent Criminal Violence. Long prison terms for these lawless acts against our Great Country!""
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany also weighed in, stating, ""Over the last 5 weeks, there has been a sustained assault on the life and property of civilians, law enforcement officers, government property, and revered American monuments such as the Lincoln Memorial. Today, President Donald J. Trump took decisive action to put an end to this lawlessness and protect American streets from vandalism and mob violence.""

""He's like a child,"" the 77-year-old Biden said. ""He can't believe this is happening to him, all his whining and self-pity. This pandemic didn't happen to him. It happened to all of us. His job isn't to whine about it, his job is to do something about it. To lead.""
Trump, 74, says he has been leading, and is touting that to supporters. ""We've done an incredible, historic job,"" he said. 
Trump promised another round of stimulus help while campaigning in battleground Wisconsin. But new questions surfaced about the last round of payments after the Treasury Department sent checks to more than a million dead people – $1.4 billion misspent. 
Biden called out Trump for saying the higher infection rate is because increased testing is picking up the existing cases. 
""Here's what I say, testing is a double-edged sword,"" Trump Said. 
""He thinks finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad,"" said Biden. ""That's what he's worried about. He's worried about looking bad.""
The former VP made a campaign stop in Pennsylvania Thursday where he mistakenly claimed ""now we have more than 120 million dead from COVID."" 
Trump tweeted a clip of Biden's gaffe saying, ""This is beyond a normal mistake."" 
If I ever said something so mortifyingly stupid, the Fake News Media would come down on me with a vengeance. This is beyond a normal mistake. Why isn’t the media reporting it? pic.twitter.com/KkuWLkMfp7
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2020
The virus has claimed more than 124,000 lives as new cases surge nationwide. 
Biden criticized Trump for holding large rallies despite more than a dozen members of his own staff recently testing positive.  
""We're gonna be dealing with this for a long time,"" Biden said. ""Trump can't wish it away! He can't bend it to meet his political wishes. There are no miracles coming.""
Biden's campaign confirmed he will attend three debates with Trump. 
The Commander-in-Chief is down in several of the latest polls, some showing Biden up by double digits.  
Some conservatives point to polls being wrong when Trump beat Hillary Clinton, blaming liberal media outlets and pollsters for underreporting Trump's support. But conservative commentator Matt Walsh says the polls shouldn't be totally ignored.
""Make all the lame excuses you want. You don't even believe the excuses yourself. If Trump continues just tweeting while America burns, he will lose in a landslide. Don't tell me about 2016. This ain't 2016. Things have changed drastically. Trump is losing right now. Big time,"" Walsh tweeted on Friday."

With states like Texas and Florida posting record numbers of new cases of coronavirus this week health officials warn Americans to continue taking precautions.
Unlike the early months of the pandemic, the majority of new cases are in younger people under the age of 45.
Most people who die from the virus are over age 80, but the fear is still that asymptomatic young people will pass it to older Americans.
    
""Usually when we see a spike in positive cases two weeks later we often see an increase in hospitalizations, four weeks later is when we see a jump in deaths,"" CBN News Medical Reporter Lorie Johnson told Faith Nation Thursday.
And the CDC estimates that 20 million Americans have been infected – roughly 10 times as many as have been confirmed.
Texas reported more than 17,000 new cases in the last three days and a record of nearly 5,000 hospitalizations.
Gov. Greg Abbott is now pausing the Lone Star State's re-opening and halting elective surgeries in the state's biggest counties.
Florida is in a similar situation, reporting more than 114,000 cases total. Gov. Ron DeSantis says part of the uptick is due to increased testing. ""This is mass testing regardless of symptoms,"" he explained.
Wearing masks inside businesses is only mandatory in a handful of states, but health experts say they're a necessary tool for containing the spread of COVID.
A new model from the University of Washington suggests wearing masks could save as many as 33,000 lives between now and October.
However, in new hot spots like Arizona, Texas, and Florida resistance to masks is heating up.
    
""Are you gonna let the government tell you you have to wear a mask? No!"" chanted protesters in Arizona.
""It's our bodies, it's our choice whether we're gonna wear them, or not wear them. You guys are overstepping your boundaries 100 percent,"" said one woman speaking at a public hearing in Florida.
While masks may be inconvenient, Johnson says there's research to suggest they work.
""For some reason masks have become political, but the research is clear and overwhelming. Masks prevent transmission by 50 percent, so the overwhelming message is if you go out and you can't social distance wear a mask,"" she said.
 
Teams from the CDC are deploying to hard hit areas to trace new outbreaks and reinforce protective measures.
It's a strategy officials say helped slow new infections in North Carolina and Alabama.

Scott Scorches Democrats for Blocking Police Reform, Abusing Their 'Monopoly' on Black Voters","WASHINGTON – Recent polls show a majority of Americans feel some sort of police reform needs to happen, but Senate Democrats aren't letting the debate move ahead. They just blocked a bill put forward by Republicans on Wednesday that aimed to fix key parts of the criminal justice system. They say it didn't go far enough, so they won't even let it come up for discussion. 
""The Senate Republican Justice Act is lacking in substance and will not make the reforms needed,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) claimed. 
He and the vast majority of Senate Democrats refused to sign on to debate the bill because they say they want more sweeping change, like a provision that would hold officers liable to damages and lawsuits, and other accountability measures.

Republicans say they would have a chance to amend the bill if Democrats would just allow debate on it, but Democrats say they don't trust that promise. 
""I for one do not intend to be played,"" said Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA). 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called that ""nonsense"".
Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), one of three black US senators, wrote the bill. ""You gotta be kidding me,"" he proclaimed after Democrats blocked the debate.
He accused Democrats of punting on the issue just so they can use it in the upcoming election. ""Because the 'who' matters. They cannot allow this (Republican) party to be seen as a party that reaches out to all communities in this nation,"" he said. 
Scott said Democrats are just abusing what he calls their ""monopoly"" on black voters.  
""No matter the loyalty of the people, the return they get will always continue to go down because in monopolies you start devaluing your customer,"" said Scott. 
Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) co-sponsored the bill and also had harsh words for Democrats who opposed it. 
""We were four votes short to opening debate to discuss it,"" he said. ""Every single Republican voted for this and a handful of Democrats. But the vast majority of Democrats said, 'no, we don't want to debate this bill. We only debate the Pelosi bill when it comes out of the House.' Well, that's absurd."" 
Meanwhile, loved ones are burying victims of police-involved shootings. In Atlanta, Rayshard Brooks' family said their final goodbyes Wednesday. He was shot after resisting arrest outside a Wendy's restaurant. 
""We've been through this journey so many times where we'll see a black man be killed and we'll all watch the footage and the whole country rises up and then Congress starts debating and then it stops – and it stops because of silly stuff like this,"" said Lankford. 
The House is expected to pass its police reform bill, but Senate Leader McConnell has already given it a thumbs down, saying it goes too far.

Faith Nation airs weeknights at 9:00 on the CBN News Channel. 
With charities and non-profits seeing an increase in need during this unprecedented pandemic, a bipartisan group of senators is hoping to expand the $300 charitable giving deduction made available in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to incentivize more people to give.
For the tax years 2019 and 2020, The Universal Giving Pandemic Response Act introduced this week by Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Chris Coons (D-DE), Mike Lee (R-UT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tim Scott (R-SC), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) would create ""an above-the-line deduction for charitable giving on federal income taxes valued at up to one-third of the standard deduction (around $4,000 for an individual filer and $8,000 for married joint filers)."" 
""Nonprofits uphold Americans in our times of greatest need. Now it is time for Americans to uphold nonprofits in their moment of need,"" said Sen. Lankford in a joint statement. ""Our families need strong nonprofits to meet their essential needs.""

Many non-profits and faith-based organizations are working harder than ever to help those in need during the pandemic despite steep declines in donations. The senators hope by increasing the federal tax deduction, more Americans will step up and donate to organizations and ministries that are meeting critical needs across the country.
""As we face three national crises—a pandemic, recession, and the wounds of structural racism—Americans have responded with a tremendous spirit of generosity,"" said Sen. Chris Coons in a statement. ""People of all means are trying to help by giving what they can to help our nation heal and recover, but there's a divide among Americans who give. One in seven Americans saves their receipt for a tax deduction. The other six, typically of lesser means, do not. That's unjust, and it's ineffective. If more Americans were acknowledged for and supported in their donations, there would be more giving, period.""
Senators Lankford and Coons originally introduced the bill in 2017 and tried to get it passed earlier this year as an amendment to the CARES Act but it was not adopted. In May, Senators Lankford and Angus King (I-ME) sent a letter to Senate leadership requesting any future coronavirus relief bill include expanded charitable giving provisions. 
Lankford and Coons also introduced the bipartisan Lessening Impediments for Taxes (LIFT) for Charities Act to protect churches and other nonprofits from ""a provision in the 2017 tax law overhaul that would tax some employee benefits for the first time.""
""This year of all year's we desperately need them (churches and nonprofits) to thrive,"" Lankford told CBN News' Faith Nation during an interview Wednesday with Sen. Coons. ""Our safety net in the United States really has three elements. The family is the first safety net. Churches and nonprofits are the second safety net. And the third safety net is government. A lot of people look to the government to solve all of this. I would tell you that those of us in government understand there is no way to meet all of those needs unless we have healthy strong nonprofits..unless we have healthy strong families as well.""
""So what we have proposed is to raise the deduction level for every American during this pandemic,"" Lankford explained. ""Even if you don't itemize your taxes that you could give to a nonprofit of your choice. It's totally up to you. And that would reduce your taxes by that same amount."" 
Coons said it's important to provide incentives for people all over the country to give back to our communities, including our houses of worship and our nonprofits.
""This provision that we have introduced has six bipartisan co-sponsors,"" the Delaware senator noted. ""It would be worth up to $4,000 for an individual and $8,000 for a joint-filing couple in a reduction of your tax liability is a strong incentive for individuals to give and support what makes America's communities great.""

The live-streamed pre-rally shows drew an audience of more than 2.5 million unique viewers by themselves,"" Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.
MSNBC and CNN only aired clips from Trump's speech, but the numbers show both cable networks had about twice as many viewers as they normally draw on Saturday nights. Altogether, the three networks had around 12 million viewing their coverage of Trump's first campaign rally in three months.

Let's be clear: he is blocking it only b/c Tim Scott is a Republican. He'd rather not have reform. Shame. Shame. Shame.

Meanwhile, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) says the Left is actually working to inflame divisions rather than bringing solutions and healing. 
He recently blasted Senate Democrats from the floor of the US Senate saying, ""Our voters sent us here to make things better. To rebuild. To heal. But that's not what we're doing. No, for the last several weeks, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and their allies in the media, and some professional political activists on a payroll, have been trying to divide us against each other, to paralyze us, to stoke resentment of our fellow citizens and hatred of this nation that we all call home.""
Hawley said the other side of the political divide is essentially stoking another Civil War. ""You'd think the way some in the media talk about this country that they're sad we're still not fighting the Civil War. They would like us to fight a new civil war in our culture, day and night, without end.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also criticized Democrats as engaging in ""political nonsense."" Still, he vowed to try again, hoping to pass legislation before a July 4 holiday recess. McConnell switched his vote to ""no"", a procedural move so he could swiftly bring it back for reconsideration.
The House is set to approve the Democrats' version of the bill later this week. The two bills, the House and Senate versions, would ultimately need to be reconciled to become law.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated she is eager to enter talks with the Senate, a potential signal that the door is not closed to compromise.

The event will be held at Dream Center Church in Phoenix which holds 3,000 people. It's the president's third time in Arizona this year, his last trip was last month when he visited a mask-making facility. 
The virus is even hitting his campaign staff. Six people working for the campaign tested positive for COVID-19 before Trump's rally in Tulsa and now CBN News has learned two more staffers who attended the campaign stop in Oklahoma also tested positive afterward. 
""We're doing so much testing, so much more than any other country,"" Trump said. ""When you do more testing, you find more cases and then they report our cases through the roof.""

Arizona Republican Senator Martha McSally traveled with Trump ""to see the progress made at our southern border."" 
She recently appeared on CBN News' Faith Nation with a message of hope as the country faces a surge in infections and the US death toll hitting 120,000.
""Let's all work together to allow people to safety work, stately go about our lives while we fight this virus,"" McSally said. ""We will defeat this virus as we are investing in cures and in treatments and vaccines but it's going to be among us, we each do our part."" 
Aside from the rally in Phoenix, Trump also surveyed a border fence between Yuma and Mexico and held a roundtable discussion on border security.

The federal statute Trump cites subjects anyone who willfully injures or destroys, or attempts to injure or destroy, any structure, plaque, statue or other monument on public property commemorating the service of any person or persons in the armed forces of the United States to fines, up to 10 years imprisonment or both.
Trump's declaration comes as protesters tried to pull down a monument of Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States, in a park located near the White House before police stopped them.

A number of protesters broke through a fence surrounding the 168-year-old bronze equestrian statue at the center of Lafayette Square just across the street from the White House. 
They climbed atop the sculpture and tied ropes around both Jackson and his horse before attempting to pull the statue from its base, which had been spray-painted with the word ""killer.""

Baton-wielding police moved in and forcibly removed protesters from the park, at times firing chemical irritants to disperse the crowds. Some people were seen being taken away in handcuffs.
Besides the Jackson statue, there was also a second incident of vandalism involving St. John's Church. Vandalism has also occurred at the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Memorial since the protests began late last month following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 
Trump took to Twitter Monday night, calling the efforts to topple the monument ""disgraceful vandalism"" of a ""magnificent statue."" 
I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran's Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent.....

Jackson, a former US Army general who served two terms in the White House from 1829 to 1837, has long been criticized by Native American activists for his role in forcing indigenous tribes off their ancestral lands. Many of them died in what several tribes refer to as ""The Trail of Tears"" when some of them were relocated to the Indian Territory. 
At first, only memorials to Confederate soldiers and officers were targeted, but the demonstrators have moved on to attack other historical figures, including the pulling down of a statue of George Washington, the nation's first president, in Portland, OR, and a monument to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in San Francisco, CA. Grant was the Union general who defeated Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, which led to the end of the American Civil War and also served as the nation's 18th president.

During our time together both outside and inside the Oval Office, the president had a lot on his mind. It led to a wide-ranging interview that touched on numerous topics including the coronavirus, racial tensions, his poll numbers, John Bolton, the Supreme Court and even accusations of treason against President Obama.
  
But the main topic the president was itching to discuss was his 2020 election opponent: Joe Biden and making sure evangelicals understand what is at stake.

 
David Brody: ""If Joe Biden gets elected President of the United States, what does that mean for America, exactly?""
 
President Trump: ""Well, I can tell you what it means for your religion. It means choice. It means that you're going to put a radical Lefty on the Court and that's going to be the end of pro-life, it won't even have a chance. So, that's what it means. As you know, nobody has been more pro-life as president than I have.""
The Supreme Court at Stake
 
President Trump: ""If Biden gets in, look, he's not going to do it. Joe is shot. Somebody, whoever is going to be running the party is going to put radical Left judges on the Supreme Court and all over the court system. I think I'll have close to 300 judges by the time I finish my first term, hopefully, a lot more than that, but it's a record number and we have pro-life judges, and you look at the Supreme Court, they're pro-life, so we'll see what happens.""

David Brody: ""What do you think of what happened with Neil Gorsuch in the 6-3 decision with the LGBT civil rights? That was a shock to a lot of folks.""
President Trump: ""I was surprised. I was surprised. Some people felt that it was a decision that they weren't as surprised as I was, yeah I was surprised.""
David Brody: ""And John Roberts? Is he the new Anthony Kennedy? Or potentially worse?""
President Trump: ""Well, so far we're not doing too well. It says, look, we've had a lot of losses with a Court that was supposed to be in our favor. This is just to show what it means. You know, you'll probably have a couple of more judges in the next four years, it could even be more than that, could be three or four. If you have a radical Left group of judges, religion I think will be almost wiped out in America. If you look at it, pro-life will be absolutely wiped out. So if you have that happening, pro-life is going to be out. It's going to be gone.""
Who's Winning the 2020 Race?
 
David Brody: ""What do you make of the state of the race right now? We've seen polls, even some friendly polls showing you behind. Do you buy any of that?""
 
President Trump: ""I don't because I see much enthusiasm right now. I see so much enthusiasm and a lot of it in terms of what you're talking about, has to do with the whole pro-life movement. A lot of it has to do with that, but I think we're doing much better than we did in '16. And I think there's actually more enthusiasm than there was in '16.""
 
David Brody: ""Why do you think that?""
 
President Trump: ""I just think it. I feel it. I mean, I see it. Now we got hit with this horrible pandemic, but we've done a great job. We came up with testing, frankly, we test so much that it's almost unfair, you know, when they say cases were 25 million tests, and other countries are barely even testing.""
Stop Testing for the Virus?
 
David Brody: ""At the Tulsa rally when the media is hitting you on that where you said, 'I told my staff stop the testing,' they're saying 'was that tongue-in-cheek' or...?""
 
President Trump: ""No. It's semi tongue-in-cheek. I say it all the time. I know some people thought it was tongue-in-cheek. It's unfair. We're doing so much testing, so much more than any other country. And to be honest with you, when you do more testing, you find more cases. And then they report our cases are through the roof. But other countries, many countries don't even test with real quality outside of you know, people that are very sick. So we go out and we test 25 million people, which is a lot, you never thought that was even possible. Most people didn't. And we could go up a lot higher than that. And I guess we are, but I tell my people, it's a double-edged sword because we do so much testing. And again, we have kids with sniffles and all of a sudden we report a case and they're are in no danger whatsoever. You know, if you look at the numbers, below 18, very few people are affected. The governor of New Jersey who is a very good guy but very liberal. That's okay. He was telling me thousands of deaths. And they only had one under 18. Think of it. One young person who died under the age of 18, with thousands of deaths so that tells you their immune system or something is doing well. And the one person did have a medical problem.""
David Brody: ""But just to clear up, there wasn't a direct order, if you will, to staff, to stop the testing.""
 
President Trump: ""No. But I think we put ourselves at a disadvantage.""
Trump Says Bolton Is a Liar
 
David Brody: ""I don't want to talk about the John Bolton book, but he did say something in that book about the media. He said something about you saying journalists should be jailed and then executed. I mean, you want to respond to that?""
 
President Trump: ""He made it up. Look, he's admitted that he will lie. He's admitted that. There was a report that I saw where he will admit that he will lie in order to get the job done and he lied. I gave John Bolton a great opportunity and by the way, many of the things he said there were many other people in the room because it's not like I'm alone with one person. I have a lot of big delegations with me and they've got a big delegation. And Steve Mnuchin came out and Mike Pompeo came out and Mick Mulvaney came out. They all came out, and they said, it's a lie.""
Obama and Treason
 
David Brody: ""On Obama and the spying situation, this idea that they were spying on your campaign, you've been asked before about what crime he would have potentially committed.""
 
President Trump: ""Treason."" 
 
David Brody: ""Well, that's what I was going to ask you.""
President Trump: ""It's treason. Look, when I came out a long time ago, I said they've been spying on our campaign. They've been 'taping', that was in quotes, meaning a modern-day version of 'taping', they were spying on my campaign, I told you that a long time ago. It turned out I was right. Let's see what happens to them now. I never met Durham because I want to stay out of it because otherwise, it's going to look political, but as you know, Durham is a highly respected person and Bill Barr is doing a great job as Attorney General. Let's see what they come up with but they don't have to tell me. All I have to do is read the papers – the insurance policy – ""in case she doesn't win, we have an insurance policy."" Well, that was all the stuff that we went through over the last two and a half years. Now we've caught them. We caught them cold. Strozk and Page, the two lovers, Brennan and Clapper the way they lied.""
 
David Brody: ""Democrats can't stand Bill Barr. They think he's political.""
 
President Trump: ""You know why? Because he's doing such a good job because he's law and order. He's got them in his crosshairs, and now we have to see what's going to happen.""
Evangelicals and Trump
 
David Brody: ""I want to turn to evangelicals for a little bit. Look, you've done a boatload for evangelicals, for sure. And as a matter of fact, you've over delivered for evangelicals...""
 
President Trump: ""More than any president in history by a factor of 10.""
 
David Brody: ""Yeah, I don't think anybody would actually disagree with that. Let me ask you this about the law and order president and balancing that with compassion because the evangelicals that may want to go away from you, a percentage or two, will say they want to see more balance, especially with everything going on with George Floyd and coronavirus. So what is it exactly in that maybe in the future or what you've done this administration from a compassion standpoint that people should be aware of?""
 
President Trump: ""Well, let me tell you. You have George Floyd. But you also have 14 people killed this weekend in Chicago. So you got to balance them out and say, wait a minute, we need law and order. And it's run – all of these problems, Seattle, Portland, Chicago. You could go to Oakland, You could go to Baltimore. What do they have in common? – They're run by Liberal Democrats just like Joe Biden. Our nation will go to hell if he gets elected. Your 401K's, which are now setting records, will go down, maybe to nothing, maybe to dust, because he's going to raise everybody's taxes. He has no idea what he's doing anyway. You know that. He didn't when he was in primetime 20 years ago, you know, he never got more than 1%. I used to call them ""1% Joe."" And then Obama took them off the trash heap and it's a fluke, nobody knows how this happened. He's running against these other people, whether you like their views or not, they were competent. And he got through that whole mess, right? And now he's sitting in a basement, and he doesn't want to come out. And this is what we're going to have. If he got elected, China will own the United States.""
The Silent Majority in 2020
 
David Brody: ""Do you think you're the underdog in this race?""
 
President Trump: ""I don't know. I think we have tremendous support. I really do. I think it's the silent majority. There's a silent majority. It happened last time. Remember the people came out and everyone said where did all these people come from? And it really is, it's a group of people that's massive. And they work and they're smart, and they're brilliant. And they're this and that, everything is good. And many evangelicals are in that group. You know, I got a tremendous evangelical support. I mean Christian support was incredible for me. It was incredible. And I think it should be better because before I was talking, even you said, Well, are you sure? And I said, 'I'm sure.' But now I've done it. Again. they said I'm the most pro life president in history, by far, more so than Ronald Reagan. And so now I've established my credentials, before I was just talking. You ought to ask a guy like a Biden or ask his campaign, give a list of judges, see where they stand on pro-life, see where they stand on it. You will not be able to get that list because they're going to put an absolute radical Lefty in there in the Supreme Court and other judges.""
Did God Pick Trump 'For Such a Time as This'?
 
David Brody: ""I want to ask you, on the evangelical front. I've asked Sarah Sanders, Mike Pompeo, they all give me the same answer I say, 'Was President Trump put in office for such a time as this? Did God put President Trump in office for such a time as this?' I never asked you that question. What do you think?""
 
President Trump: ""Well, I don't know what they said specifically.""
 
David Brody: ""They said yes.""
 
President Trump: ""Okay because Ben Carson said the same thing. You know, Ben Carson came to me because he ran a very effective campaign. And he did a good job. He really did. You know, he came in one of the top people. And he said to me, 'You know, you're going to win.' I said, 'Ben, I'm running against you. What are you telling me?' He said, 'You're going to win, because God put you here for this occasion.' I said, 'what a lovely thing to say.' That was the first one that I heard from Ben Carson. And it was during the campaign, I was running against him, and he was saying I'm going to win. He's a very high quality guy. He's done a great job in the administration.""
David Brody: ""Do you buy that?""
 
President Trump: ""I almost don't even want to think about it because you know what? I hope it's true. All I'm going to do is I'm going to do my best and part of what I'm doing my best on is for the religious community, beyond evangelical, evangelicals a very big part is very important to me. You know, we have great support.""
 
""I just hope I get tremendous evangelical Christian support and I'm not saying this as a bragging thing, nobody has done more for religion than I have. Look what I've done in Israel, which is a big thing with the evangelicals.""
 
David Brody: ""Tier A.""
 
President Trump: ""In many respects, it is more important to the evangelicals than to Jewish people in this country. But look, what I've done with the capital of Israel. You know, when you go into Jerusalem, what I've done. Every president said they were going to make Jerusalem, the capital of Israel.  And then when they got into office, they didn't do it. When I say every, many for decades, they've all been campaigning. And I understand why. Because when I got into office, as soon as they thought I was even considering it, I was called by so many world leaders asking me in the strongest of terms, not to do it. And they all changed their mind. Not that they changed their mind, they just didn't do it. I did it. Golan Heights I did. You know, probably the biggest thing I did for Israel was Iran, breaking up that horrible deal made by President Obama $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. So I've done a lot for religion, and I've done a lot for the evangelicals, and I hope we can have your support and if Biden gets even 1%, it would be terrible. And you can forget about the pro-life movement because it'll be, it will be over.""
 
David Brody: ""Mr. President, your time is valuable. Thank you.""
 
President Trump: ""Thank you so much, David.""
 
David Brody: ""Thank you so much.""

And part of what I'm doing my best one is for the religious community beyond evangelical, evangelicals a very big part is very important to me. You know, we have great support. I was so honored when Franklin Graham said that his father voted for me. And that was something that Billy Graham has never announced, who he was voting for. But Franklin Graham said his father voted for me. He went public with it. As you know, to me that was a big moment because I have such respect for Franklin and for the family and Billy Graham is really great. Like when he said that his father, his last vote was for me and his father never announced who was voting for, would never talk about it. Now I think I have great I think I have great support. There's a lot of hidden support. People in our country that don't riot, don't protest, that don't you know, they work hard. They never had a voice into like, meaning over the last long period of time. We call them the Forgotten men and women, they would have forgotten. They were very successful. They were, they do a great job. They're smart, they have everything, but they were forgotten by the politicians. They showed up in 16. I think they're going to show up in larger numbers in 20.

But Monday they gave the president a victory. They refused to take up a case challenging the 25 percent tariffs he slapped on steel imports. Steel importers wanted the high court to rule that unconstitutional. They’ve been arguing that power should rest in the hands of Congress, not with the president.
But the court let the president’s power to impose such tariffs stand.
Could the Court Announce 14 Rulings in 3 Days?
That’s about all the Supreme Court announced Monday – a big surprise with 14 rulings still left to come out, and this term expected to last less than two weeks.
The big hold up may well be that the coronavirus pandemic threw the high court off by about two months. It put off hearing at least 10 cases that would have come before the justices in March or April. They eventually heard those 10 cases in May.   
But usually, it takes many weeks for the nine justices to argue behind the scenes and try to win allies for a majority ruling, then actually vote and decide the ruling, then write the very complicated opinions on both the majority and minority sides.
So it could be the justices may feel they have to go beyond their usual deadline of having everything wrapped up and done before the 4th of July holiday.
Many Plans Could Be Upset
Usually, in the last month or so before the end of the term, the court announces rulings on Mondays and Thursdays.  So if they were to depart by the 4th of July, that would mean dividing the rulings for the 14 cases left into just three days of announcements – roughly five a day – and that’s just exceedingly odd for this court.
The downside of continuing the term beyond the 4th of July is that the various justices sometimes have summer classes they help teach or big speeches to give. These may have already been scheduled months ago. Some of the justices might have long-booked vacation plans.
We likely won’t know what they decide, though, until the last second because the justices seem to love keeping any news of their ways or decisions secret as long as they possibly can.
Abortion Case May Seem Minor but Could Become Major
Of those 14 cases still left to have their rulings rolled out, one of the most anticipated is the Louisiana abortion case. It involves a state law insisting abortion doctors have admitting privileges at a local hospital.   
The law’s proponents say that’s important so that if something goes wrong during an abortion, the doctor could get his or her patient into an emergency room quickly and be on hand to work with the patient and those emergency room doctors.
Opponents say only one abortion doctor in Louisiana would meet the criteria to have such admitting privileges, so it would basically run all the other abortion clinics out of business and leave one doctor to handle the roughly 10,000 abortions women get in Louisiana most years.
Those who’d like to see the justices visit Roe v. Wade say this case could give them a chance since it involves women’s safety and one of the key points in deciding Roe was whether it was a safe procedure.  But four justices seem for sure to vote against the Louisiana law, and Chief Justice Roberts has seemed unwilling to side with the other four more conservative justices in any ruling that would really rock the judicial boat – like overturning Roe.
Religious Liberty, Conscience Rights on the Line
Two of the remaining cases could affect religious liberty.   
In one of them, a pair of Catholic schools got rid of teachers who then sued the schools. They contend the schools practiced employment discrimination.   
But the schools are arguing their hiring and firing of teachers should be covered by something known as the ministerial exception. It’s a doctrine that says the government has no business being involved in the hiring and firing of people responsible for the passing on of a faith – something that ministers do, for sure, and teachers also do in a religious school. If the schools lose, it would let the government have a big say on whether or not a religion can decide who’ll teach the faith.

Another case involves the Little Sisters of the Poor, who thought their refusal to provide abortion-causing contraceptives in the healthcare coverage of their employees had been settled once and for all by the high court – and in their favor.
But then states came against the federal government, saying it had no right to exempt the Little Sisters, or any other similar organization, from this Obamacare edict.
If the Little Sisters lose, they could face fines of up to 70 to 75 million dollars a year, which would surely sink their ministry to the poor and elderly. It would also be a serious infringement on the conscience rights of religious believers, with the government forcing such people to go against a deeply-held core belief or face severely-punishing penalties.

The following is the transcript from one segment of the interview. 
David Brody: Let me ask you. I don't want to talk about the John Bolton book, but I bet he did say something in that book about the media. He said something about you saying journalists should be jailed and then executed. I mean, you want to respond to that?
President Trump: He made it up. Look, he's admitted that he will lie. He's admitted that there was a report that I saw where he will admit that he will lie in order to get the job done. I gave John Bolton and he lied. I gave you John Bolton, the great opportunity and by the way, the things many of the things he said there are many other people in the room. Because it's not like I'm alone with one person, right? I have a lot of big delegation with me and they've got a big delegation. And Steve Mnuchin came out and Mike Pompeo came out and Mick Mulvaney came out. Many people, they all came out, and they said, it's a lie. He's a liar. I fired him. I got him out. He was no good only want to do is bomb people. Now, I don't mind having an opposing point of view. And frankly, I think I used him very well, because when people saw him, they know he was sort of crazy. And maybe it helped me negotiate good deals, frankly. But he was terrible. He had no personality. He had no warmth. What I don't think I've ever seen this guy smile If you haven't seen him smile. He said, John, do you have a smile? And he didn't even know how to answer the question. No, John. John was washed up. And I took him and I gave him something he couldn't get senate confirmed because they hated him. They hated him and they thought he was a whack job. I asked him, Do me a favor. Tell me. Are you still happy with the decision? You push it so hard to go into Iraq? He said, Yes. I said you're happy we spent almost eight trillion dollars in the Middle East because of that decision, you think was a good decision? Yes. I said this guy's bad. and then of course, the Libyan model. You remember the Libyan model, one of the stupidest things ever said on television was said by John Bolton, so he was pretty much gone early on, but we kept him around. And he went out and wrote a book. And by the way, the judge made a tremendous statement. I mean, usually, the judge said about the release of classified material. I think John Bolton's got a big problem. Plus, he's not going to be able to keep his money. I don't think there's a chance that he's going to be able to keep this money. So we'll see what happens.

The following is the transcript from one segment of the interview. 
David Brody: President Trump, great to see you again, sir.
President Trump: Thank you very much, David.
David Brody: Where do I even begin? Let's start with Joe Biden. If Joe Biden gets elected President of the United States, what does that mean for America, exactly?
President Trump: Well, I can tell you what it means for your religion, it means choice. It means that you're going to put a radical Lefty on the Court and that's going to be the end of pro-life, it won't even have a chance. So, that's what it means. As you know, nobody has been more pro-life as President than I have. I even went to the recent thing three blocks away in the park and I'm the first President that went to it. 
David Brody: The March for Life. 
President Trump: Between Mexico City, a lot of your viewers might not know that but nobody says Ronald Reagan, and even his was light. His was Mexico City light, mine was Mexico City strong. If Biden gets in, look, he's not going to do it. Joe is shot. Somebody, whoever is going to be running the party is going to put radical Left judges on the Supreme Court and all over the court system. I think I'll have close to 300 judges by the time I finish my first time, hopefully, a lot more than that, but it's a record number and we have pro-life judges, and you look at the Supreme Court, they're pro-life, so we'll see what happens. We will, I think we are going to win, maybe big because we've done a job like nobody else. You know, we were sailing and then we got hit with the Chinese virus. But we were so far up and doing very well and then all of a sudden it was an artificial situation that happened to us. We had to turn it off. We had to turn off the economy, I think we did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. And now we're turning it back on and we're doing record business. Record jobs, as you know were announced last week, we have record retail sales announced last week, and I think it's going to be a V-shape. A lot of people disagreed with me, now they are all agreeing with me. But we're doing well. In terms of religion, in terms of evangelical, in terms of Christian with or without evangelical, in terms of Jewish, in terms of anything, you're going to have radical Left judges appointed and in terms of pro-life, you can forget it. 
David Brody: What do you think of what happened with Neil Gorsuch in the 6-3 decision with the LGBT civil rights? That was a shock to a lot of folks.
President Trump: I was surprised. I was surprised. Some people felt that it was a decision that they weren't as surprised as I was, yeah I was surprised.
David Brody: And John Roberts? Is he the new Anthony Kennedy? Or potentially worse?
President Trump: Well, so far we're not doing so well. It says, look, you've had a lot of losses with a Court that was supposed to be in our favor. This is just to show
This is just to show what means we need, you know, you'll probably have a couple of more judges in the next four years, it could even be more than that could be three or four. If you have a radical left group of judges, religions I think will be almost wiped out at America. If you look at it, pro-life will be absolutely wiped out. So if you have that happening, pro-life is going to be out. It's going to be gone.

On Friday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected a legal bid to stop the rally over health concerns
""We are all on board going to Oklahoma,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. ""We are taking appropriate measures like hand sanitizers and temperature checks and masking provided at the door.""
One million tickets were requested and 100,000 expected to attend. Supporters traveled from as far as California and have already lined up outside. 
""I really thought this was an important rally for me to go to,"" Blake Markell said. ""It's the 9th one I've been to, but after being away from rallies so long.""

The Oklahoma National Guard was even called in to help with security.
Trump tweeted ""any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!"" 
""The mayor noted that individuals from groups that have been involved in violent and destructive behavior in other states are planning to travel to Tulsa for the purpose of causing unrest in and around the rally and that's an unacceptable proposition,"" McEnany said.

Every Senate Democrat, joined by two independents and Republican Susan Collins of Maine, called for a vote on the so-called Equality Act.
The bill passed the House of Representatives last year. It would extend protections for LGBTQ individuals, superseding the rights of religious groups.

One result would be forcing faith-based adoption agencies to place kids with same-sex couples, even when other adoption agencies are available.
Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) joined with Republicans Joshua Hawley (MO) and Mike Lee (UT) in blocking the vote.
""The Equality Act says that if you're a faith-based adoption agency that only places children in a home where there's a mom and dad there, then you either have to change your faith or close,"" Lankford said. 
""The Equality Act says to that institution, 'I would rather have fewer adoption agencies in America than have you open',"" Lankford continued. ""That's not protecting the rights of all Americans.""
Critics of the Equality Act say it would also weaken the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a bipartisan 1994 law that protects religious liberty.
Sen. Hawley argued that the Equality Act can't be approved because it ""guts"" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on the heels of a stunning Supreme Court ruling that rewrote the definition of sex with ""nearly nothing to say about religious liberty or religious believers in this country.""

It's a day that's come to be known as Juneteenth and as America confronts race-relations, it's becoming a much more important holiday to recognize, but many Americans don't know much about it.
President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves in January of 1863.
Two and a half years later on June 19, 1865, the news finally reached Galveston, Texas, which at the time was the largest city in the Lone Star state.
Union General Gordon Granger read the order aloud, ""all slaves are free"" he announced from the county courthouse.

""Essentially slavery ended on that day,"" says Hank Thierry with the Galveston Historical Foundation.

""It's really a story that Galveston has been trying to get out for years,"" says Tommie Boudreaux, also with the Galveston Historical Foundation.
The day became known as Juneteenth.
""Juneteenth is actually the day that African-Americans celebrate their independence. So with all of the conversation around racial equality and justice in the United States, a lot of people are turning to Juneteenth as a symbol, as a way they can celebrate and honor the sacrifices that African-Americans have made,"" says Jesse Holland, a historian at The George Washington University.

The inscription on this Juneteenth statue in Galveston, Texas reads, ""On June 19, 1865, at the close of the Civil War, US Army General Gordon Granger issued an order in Galveston stating that the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation was in effect."" (AP Photo)
The police killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed have raised the holiday's profile.
Now a number of businesses including Nike, Twitter, and Target are declaring it a holiday.
Some states are doing the same.
""I'm going to sign an executive order today, hence all my pens, recognizing Juneteenth as a holiday for state employees,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) told reporters before a signing ceremony.
Inside the US Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the removal of portraits of former speakers who were members of the Confederacy.
Today, 46 states recognize Juneteenth as a holiday or day of recognition.
""So, this is why more and more people are talking about it, because, frankly a lot of people didn't know it exists,"" says Holland.

Durbin Seriously Use a Painful Racial Term to Slam 'Token' Effort by Sen. Tim Scott?,"On the day that Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott unveiled his response to the racial unrest in America, his sincere attempt to push for justice and police reforms was met with a stunning verbal slam from a Democratic senator.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) directly criticized Scott's GOP bill as a ""token, half-hearted approach.""
The term ""token"" has strong racial undertones. The word has often been used when referring to a ""token"" minority in entertainment – in other words, a fake attempt at racial diversity in films and TV.  Yet that's the same term the white senator from Illinois used to describe the efforts of Sen. Scott – one of the few African Americans in the US Senate.
It's not a new term. In fact, ""tokenism"" was a central issue raised by Martin Luther King, Jr. during the Civil Rights movement.

On the floor of the US Senate, Scott rebuked Durbin for being divisive and hurtful. ""On the other side they're wanting to race-bait on tokenism,"" Scott said.
He also wondered out loud if Durbin was seriously calling him a ""token"" black Republican.
""To think that anti-lynching that's a part of this legislation would be considered a token piece of legislation because perhaps I'm African American and I'm on the other side of the aisle, I don't know what he meant, but I can tell you that this day to have those comments again hurts the soul,"" Scott said.
Durbin's communications director later tried to explain away the ""token"" comment as some sort of critique against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and said Durbin had apologized to Scott.
Scott also had choked back tears, pausing for nearly 40 seconds to regain his composure, as he reminded everyone that his bill was introduced on the same day a racist gunman had killed nine people at an African American church in Charleston five years ago. 
Scott explained that he lost a dear friend that day – state senator Clementa C. Pinckney, the senior pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church which is in his home state.

South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott introduced the bill. The GOP hopes it will help bridge the divide between people of color and police.
""Too often we're having a conversation in this country about are you supporting the law enforcement community or are you supporting communities of color – this is a false binary choice,"" Scott said.
'This Is a Biblical Issue'
Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, who worked with Scott to craft the legislation, pointed his fellow senators to the Bible to see what God has to say about racial equality.
Lankford told the Senate about how God makes clear in the Old Testament that He wants ""equal weights and measures"", which means people should be treated with respect and racial equality.

He also referenced the Bible's book of Revelation and its image of racial unity in the kingdom of heaven.
""There is this gathering around the throne that's pictured at the very end of the gathering of the kingdom of God. And as they gather around the throne, it's described as every tribe, every nation, every language, every people, all gathered. See, for me, this is a biblical issue. As well as being a personal issue. But for us as a nation, it's a legal issue. And it's where we find inconsistencies of the application of the law we are to correct it. And do what we can to be able to make it right.""
The bill calls for an end to chokeholds, increases the use of body cameras, and sets up a national database for reporting incidents involving force.

Lankford encourages people to invite families of another race into their home to share a meal.

The administration has filed a restraining order to stop the release of Bolton's new book, The Room Where it Happened, claiming it violates national security. 
In an exclusive interview with ABC News' Martha Raddatz, Bolton gives a glimpse of what's inside his White House memoir. 
Bolton slams Trump, calling him ""erratic,"" ""irrational,"" ""foolish,"" and ""stunningly uninformed."" 
On the issue of Russia, Raddatz asked him to describe Trump's relationship with Vladimir Putin. 
""I think Putin feels like he can play him like a fiddle,"" Bolton told her. ""I think Putin is smart, tough. I think he sees he's not faced with a serious adversary here. I don't think he's worried about Donald Trump."" 
Bolton also says Trump withheld US aid from Ukraine for political reasons and suggested China's president buy more American goods to help him win the 2020 election. 
Trump's US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer shot down that claim Wednesday on Capitol Hill. 
""Absolutely untrue,"" he said. ""Never happened. I was there. I have no recollection of that ever happening."" 
The administration calls Bolton's claims bogus and is trying to block the book with a civil lawsuit. 
Trump on Twitter: 
""Wacko John Bolton's 'exceedingly tedious' (New York Times) book is made up of lies & fake stories. Said all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him. A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war. Never had a clue, was ostracized & happily dumped. What a dope!""
Bolton’s book, which is getting terrible reviews, is a compilation of lies and made up stories, all intended to make me look bad. Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction. Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2020
The administration says Bolton's book contains classified material. 
""I will consider every conversation with me as president highly classified,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday. ""So that would mean if he wrote a book and the book gets out, he's broken the law."" 
Attorney General Bill Barr added that Bolton failed to complete the vetting process. 
""They have to go through a clearance process before they publish the book and we don't believe that Bolton went through that process,"" said Barr. 
Former congressman Trey Gowdy questioned Bolton's motives on Fox News. 
""Bolton, if you really think he's unfit to be the leader of the free world, why didn't you say anything? Why do I have to buy your book to get that?"" said Gowdy. 
It's worth noting Bolton refused to testify in the impeachment trial and in the book he's critical of how Congress handled the process. 
CBN's Chief Political Analyst David Brody says it comes down to a he-said, she-said situation. 
""The book is called 'In the Room Where it Happened.' Well, John Bolton says he was in the room where it happened. But Donald Trump has a version about that as well. He was in the room where it happened,"" said Brody. ""And then you've got a lot of folks within the White House saying that none of this is true. And part of the problem here for John Bolton is we don't have any actual words that Donald Trump said in the room where it happened. We have some vague generalities about what Donald Trump was talking about.""
If it's not stopped by the courts, Bolton's book comes out June 23rd. 
I will leave it to the media to ask why John Bolton’s memoir is debunked by his own words.

Turkey says it was targeting Kurdish rebels belonging to the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, which both Turkey and the US deem as a terrorist organization.
Using the codename ""Operation Claw-Eagle,"" Turkish fighters blew up 81 targets Sunday including shelters and caves in Sinjar, the Qandil Mountains, and Makhmour which is home to thousands of Kurds.
The attack occurred just a few days after some 200 Yazidi families were moving back into their homes in Sinjar after being displaced in 2014 when the Islamic State committed genocide against their people.
""So it was very troubling to us as well as to many others around the world,"" Nadine Maenza, a commissioner on the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) told CBN News.
Turkey says PKK fighters were planning attacks against Turkey from hideouts in the region, but Maenza says there's no proof.
""These attacks to do 81 strikes in an area that is so poor, so desperate, with so few Yazidis having returned and the ones that did return had to experience literally watching Mount Sinjar on fire was really troubling and really disturbing to them,"" she said.
""It seemed as if they weren't trying to hit the targets that they were trying to make a statement and to scare. Was it to keep the Yazidis from coming or was it to make a point that they consider the PKK to be dangerous and worthy of these kind of strikes even though it didn't seem to match the facts on the ground?"" she continued.
More than 400,000 Yazidis remain in refugee camps in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. 
Before they were defeated, ISIS kidnapped 6,000 Yazidi women and sold them into sex slavery. 3,000 of these women are still missing. 
Six years later, construction is just starting to begin to rebuild their communities that ISIS ravaged.
Maenza says for Yazidis, along with Christians in the region, there's a great need for self-governance and the building of security forces so these minority populations can be protected.
""For Turkey to come in and do this right now as they're just starting to try and get people back sent a message against Yazidis,"" she said.
Just last week USCIRF conducted a hearing on how Turkey has taken away religious freedom from a number of religious minorities, including ancient Christian communities, in northeast Syria. 
Maenza says this latest attack appears to be straight from the public relations playbook of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- to make news on the international stage in order to distract from what's happening inside his country. In this case a waning economy, the pandemic, and a growing coalition of political foes.
She compares the airstrike in Iraq to Erdogan's arrest and imprisonment of American Pastor Andrew Brunson four years ago which served as another domestic distraction at the time.
USCIRF has condemned Turkey's behavior both in Iraq and Syria.
""Turkey should not be going after religious minorities either in Iraq or Syria. When they do we're going to call them out,"" she says.

US Sen. Martha McSally (R-AZ), in a wide-ranging interview with CBN News, said police officers need to learn how to ""step in and stop"" other officers from using excessive force. 
""Anybody who watched the horrific murder of George Floyd, not only could you see the murder happening right there, but you saw three other officers who were facilitating or standing by and doing nothing as others were pleading for his life,"" said the Arizona Republican.
The GOP-led congressional legislation from Sen. McSally and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) sets up a showdown between Democrats in the House who say the legislation does not go far enough to change policing in America. 
The duty to intervene is a key element in the Scott-McSally bill. McSally said her experience in the military as an Air Force fighter pilot taught her that, ""if you see another officer using excessive force, doing something wrong, even if they outrank you, you need to step in and stop it. You don't facilitate or just standby and do nothing.""
The first woman in the US to fly in combat and the first woman to command a US fighter squadron, McSally is in a closely-watched Senate race against Democratic challenger Mark Kelly.
""I am standing on the wall to make sure the Senate majority does not flip,"" said McSally, who is among at least seven GOP senators facing tough-fought reelection in November. 
""I've been under constant attack,"" she said, adding that, ""We say as fighter pilots you know you're over the target when you're getting flack.""
Arizona is one of nearly two dozen states experiencing a major spike in COVID-19 cases as the country faces a surge in infections amid the coronavirus pandemic.
""A lot of people are really fearful right now,"" McSally said, but ""we need not live in fear.""
""Individuals who are vulnerable,"" to COVID-19, ""have to be way more careful than everybody else because of their vulnerability,"" said McSally. 
""For those who are young and healthy, as you're returning to work, do it safely. As you go about your lives, be mindful and cognizant of the risks,"" she said. 
""We can all relate to fear,"" said McSally. 
In her new book Dare to Fly: Lessons in Never Giving Up, she shares her journey of grief and adversity after losing her father at the 
age of 12. 
McSally was with her father the day before he died. Before he took his last breath, ""he told me to make him proud,"" she said. 
The youngest of five children, she was told she could be anything she wanted. McSally joined the Air Force after her father's death both to channel her life in a positive way and, unwilling to burden her single mother, to pay back her education through service instead of student debt.
McSally said that ""in the darkest hours of my life"" she found that ""what others intended for evil God used for good.""

Republican Sen. Tim Scott (SC), one of three black senators currently in office, spearheaded the bill that aims to rebuild trust between communities of color and law enforcement.
In a press conference Wednesday, Sen. Scott outlined the three main goals of the Justice Act: police reform, accountability, and increased transparency.

""Too often we're having a conversation in this country about are you supporting the law enforcement community or are you supporting communities of color, this is a false binary choice,"" argued Scott. ""The answer to the question is, 'I support America. You support America. It is not a binary choice. This legislation encompasses that spirit.""
Scott believes police officers are overwhelmingly good people, but as a black man who has been stopped by law enforcement numerous times including when walking into the Capitol, he knows reform is needed.
""We find ourselves at a place with a package that I think speaks to the families that I spoke with yesterday who lost loved ones, we hear you,"" continued Scott. ""I think this package speaks very clearly to the young person who's concerned when he's stopped by the law enforcement officers, we see you."" 
The bill calls for an end to the use of chokeholds, increases the use of body cameras, and sets up a national database for reporting police incidents that lead to death or severe bodily harm.
""We're serious about making a law here, this is not about trying to create partisan differences, this is about coming together and getting an outcome,"" said Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
US Rep. Pete Stauber (R-MN), a former police officer who was shot in the head in the line of duty, introduced the legislation in the House, agreeing it's time to enact meaningful police change.
""As someone who swore an oath to serve and protect my community, I was devastated watching the video of George Floyd dying at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer who swore that same oath,"" said Stauber.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is a co-author of the House-led Justice in Policing Act, criticizes the GOP plan as ""heavy on gestures, light on real reform.""
""This is not a choice between one side of an aisle or another, it is a choice between meaningful reforms in this moment or making symbolic gestures that will do nothing to save people's lives. It's a choice between action and inaction,"" Booker said on the Senate floor this week.
The Democrats' plan goes a step further than the GOP's by calling for an end no-knock warrants and qualified immunity, which protects police officers from lawsuits.  
The House is expected to pass their bill by the end of the month, but it is unclear if the Senate will have the sixty votes needed to proceed to debate on the Justice Act next week.
Ultimately, the two sides will have to come together on a compromise bill if any of the proposed ideas are to become law.

The order motives police agencies nationwide to adopt best practices on the use of force. It also requires the sharing of information about officers who engage in misconduct. 
""Nobody wants to get rid of them more than the good police officers,"" said Trump.

The executive order also launches a co-responder program where health and social workers would join officers on nonviolent calls. 
""We will provide more resources for co-responders such as social workers who can help officers manage these complex encounters,"" Trump said. 
In the wake of George Floyd's death, the order even addresses law enforcement officer's use of knee-on-neck and chokeholds as a tactic. 
""Chokeholds will be banned except when an officer's life is at risk,"" Trump said. 
Critics maintain the executive order doesn't go far enough. 
Al Sharpton calls it ""toothless"" tweeting, ""We don't need studies. We need police that commit crimes to be punished. All police that use chokeholds claim their lives were threatened. What's new?""
""What is needed now is not stoking fear and division,"" Trump said. ""We need to bring law enforcement and communities together, not drive them apart.""
The order stops short in banning ""No Knock"" warrants which are a major demand for the ongoing protests around the country.

Trump had scheduled the rally — his first since early March — for June 19 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Black leaders said it was offensive for Trump to pick that day and that place, a city that in 1921 was the site of a fiery and orchestrated white-on-black attack.
Trump tweeted late Friday, “Many of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday.”
He said he is moving the rally to June 20 “to honor their requests.”
Trump’s signature rallies often draw tens of thousands of people but have been on hiatus since March 2 because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has now killed more than 110,000 people in the U.S.

The campaign event is set for June 19 which is drawing fire from critics who point out it's ""Juneteenth"", the same date when African Americans marked the end of slavery.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) tweeted, ""This isn't just about a link to white supremacists. He's throwing them a welcome home party.""
""The African American community is very near and dear to his heart,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. ""At these rallies, he often shares the great work he has done for minority communities.""
Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) said he looks forward to being in Tulsa next week with the commander-in-chief.
""Oklahoma, in the heart of the nation, is the right place to have a conversation about race, and is the future of our nation,"" Lankford said. 
Joe Biden is also on the campaign trail amid the COVID-19 pandemic. At the Philadelphia Enterprise Center, he talked about his plans to get the country back on track if elected in November.
""The proposal I put forward will create 10 million new jobs, not 6 bucks an hour, but 40 or 50 bucks an hour,"" Biden said.
The Biden campaign has not announced any plans to hold large rallies like his opponent.  After Oklahoma, Trump will make stops in Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina.

It's part of a Republican-led investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation that targeted the Trump campaign.   
The vote today fell along party lines. Senate Democrats oppose the investigation, but Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) did not shy from making a statement. He wants people to be fired at the end of this investigation into the now years-old matter.
""Anybody that was told about the unreliable dossier and kept going forward should be fired,"" he explained. ""Nobody on this committee can answer that question.""
Meanwhile, the Justice Department faces accusations of using its power to benefit a political ally of the president. 
Retired US District Judge John Gleeson was called in to advise on the criminal case against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn who was ensnared by the Russia investigation.
Gleeson is arguing against a Justice Department request to drop the case, saying, ""The government has engaged in highly irregular conduct.""
In a filing Wednesday, Gleeson said there was, ""clear evidence of gross prosecutorial abuse."" 
The Justice Department had dropped the case after reviewing newly disclosed FBI emails and notes regarding efforts to target Flynn.
Many political analysts say they were clear evidence of entrapment.

During an emotional testimony, George Floyd's brother pleaded with lawmakers to make sure his brother did not die in vain.
""Honor George, and make the necessary changes that make law enforcement the solution and not the problem,"" said Philonise Floyd.

Floyd described the pain he's felt watching his brother die helplessly on the ground while begging for his mom.
""George wasn't hurting anyone that day,"" continued Floyd. ""He didn't deserve to die over $20. I am asking you, is that what a black man is worth? $20? This is 2020. Enough is enough. The people marching in the streets are telling you enough is enough.""
Also testifying before the committee was Angela Underwood Jacobs, the sister of Patrick Underwood, an Oakland, CA, police officer killed in a targeted drive-by shooting. It happened less than two weeks ago as he guarded a federal courthouse in Oakland where protests were gathered nearby.
""When innocent people are harmed in the name of justice, no one prevails, we all lose,"" testified Jacobs. ""This is greater than a black, white, or blue issue – it is a humanity issue.""
In her testimony, Jacobs described calls to defund the police as ""ridiculous"" and instead offered this solution.
""I wholeheartedly urge us all, all Americans not to give in to hate and anger, but to resolve hatred with kindness and love. To lead with a sense of purpose and renewed energy. To create positive change as I have outlined here through education, jobs, housing, and listening,"" she said. 
While others testifying warned of what's happened in cities like Cleveland, OH, where police budgets and presence were cut. 
""The murder rates have climbed. The property crimes are at record levels. Aggravated robbery statistics are higher. Drug sales, drug use, drug abuse is higher.  Drug and alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents are the highest they've ever been,"" explained Pastor Darrell Scott of Cleveland's New Spirit Revival Center.
Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said the goal of the police reform bill sponsored by Democrats is to give police a mentality of a guardian, not a warrior.
""The bill would make it easier for the federal government to successfully prosecute misconduct police cases. It would ban chokeholds. It would ban racially and religious profiling, It would encourage prosecutions independent of local police, and it would eliminate the dubious court-made doctrine of qualified immunity for law enforcement,"" Nadler said. 
While many Republicans don't support everything in the Democrat's bill, they know change is needed.
""We can work together on meaningful reform and real results while upholding the respect and appreciation that is due every American patriot who faithfully serves us on the thin blue line,"" said Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA)
On the Senate side, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) is meeting with the White House to discuss police reform legislation President Trump might support, including a bill that would require states receiving federal funding for law enforcement to report details of officer-related shootings.

It sounds like a dream, but even amid civil war and the terror of ISIS, it was a reality in northeast Syria before Turkey was allowed to invade the region.
""It's the best religious freedom conditions in the Middle East,"" says Nadine Maenza, vice-chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).
She's talking about conditions fostered by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria also known as AANES. That's the governing body behind the Syrian Democratic Army which lost 11,000 soldiers while fighting ISIS alongside a small number of US troops. 
""They formed this government in the middle of a civil war, in the middle of fighting ISIS and set up a democracy and what they call a social contract that's kind of like our Bill of Rights that really protects the rights of everybody to practice their own religion and to have human rights, and it's really an extraordinary thing. You can't make people care about each other. You can't go into a country and make them follow the values that you think would be good for them...and here is a place where they're doing it on their own,"" Maenza tells CBN News.
This small quest for freedom was a critical development for Christians in the region who live alongside Kurdish and Arab Muslims, Yazidis, and other religious groups.
""This area is really one of the keys to saving Christianity in the region,"" says Maenza.
""For them to be able to stay secure and stable really secures one of the oldest Christian communities in the world - they still have Aramaic spoken in their church services. It's really quite beautiful,"" she says.
And while Turkish leaders claimed they wanted to enter northeast Syria to root out terrorism, Turkey's forces have brought a new brand of terror to the region. 
They've taken over the AANES in three places and replaced it with harsh Islamic ideology.
And in Afrin, a place experts say was never a center of terrorism, Turkish forces have demolished religious sites and even kidnapped Yazidi and Kurdish women, selling them into slavery.

Speaking before a USCIRF hearing on the matter today Michael Rubin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, testified Turkish forces have razed Kurdish and minority graveyards – actions, he says, are more consistent with ethnic cleansing than counter-terrorism.
The hearing is designed to draw attention to the issue. USCIRF has recommended the Trump administration pressure Turkey to provide a timeline to withdraw from Syria.
They also recommend the US to provide more assistance to the AANES and lift sanctions from the region which would allow the local economy to grow.
""They don't need a whole lot from us. They have 80 percent of the oil in Syria, they have some of the most fertile soil in the Middle East, so what they need is just the ability to create their own economy, to continue to govern, to be able to grow as a government, and we need to give them that space to be able to do that,"" Maenza explains.
USCIRF's work is made more difficult because it's asking the US to call out a NATO ally. However, Maenza says when it comes to religious freedom the facts on the ground speak for themselves.
Commissioners are also dealing with opinions inside the State Department that are often at odds with one another as some favor supporting the AANES while others believe the region would be better off under Turkish control.
Of course, it's not just Turkey northeast Syrians have to contend with. Iran and Russia have forces on the ground along with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's army.
Maenza says if the region falls, the consequences for Christians and Yazidis will be enormous. She predicts genocide and ethnic cleansing would likely follow.

For some corporations, imprisoning Americans is a major money-making enterprise. Private prisons have been thriving, raking in cash to put people in cages.
Private prisons have been around for decades, promoting themselves as ""cost-effective"" community partners primed to save tax dollars. However, critics say that's because they cut corners, creating unsafe conditions.
It's big business. Major private prison companies are even publicly traded and last year raked in billions in profits.
According to The Sentencing Project, they operate in 29 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons relies on them too.  
John Pfaff, professor at Fordham Law School and author of Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform, says even though private prisons only house about 9% of the total prison population they grab the most attention.
""I think people feel like there's something distinctly morally repugnant about paying cash to put people in cages,"" he tells CBN News.
Private prisons get paid for each inmate locked up in their facilities. 
In 2012, Corrections Corporation of America, now known as CoreCivic, offered a shocking deal. The company would purchase prisons in 48 states if the states would guarantee a 90% occupancy rate.
""I'm not saying corporations are evil, but corporations exist for one reason - to make money - maximum profit. That's okay if you're making widgets or toothpaste, but when you're dealing with people and you're making money off of people, you're starting to treat people like they're toothpaste and you're making money off of them,"" says John Whitehead, founder of The Rutherford Institute.
Jesus Cardenas did time for check fraud. He served part of his sentence in state prison before being transferred to a private one and says he immediately noticed a difference in the level of security.
""They were just going through the motions. The officers were just drawing a paycheck,"" Cardenas told CBN News.
He says fights were a daily occurrence and unless an inmate was severely injured they largely went unnoticed.     
Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE also contracts with private facilities. 
In a federal lawsuit filed last month, a Mexican woman says within hours of being deported, she and two other women were taken from their dorms and raped by officials at a facility run by CoreCivic in Houston.
Fran Buntman, a criminologist at The George Washington University, says when a government detains or sentences someone it has an obligation to see it through.
""We've taken away from their liberty rights to control their own lives, we as a society and the government as the institution looking after them have a responsibility to their welfare,"" she says. ""We cannot subcontract out that responsibility to a private agency.""
Incarceration is a big-ticket item. States spend $50 billion a year, and all said, when you factor in police and prosecutors, it costs a total of $200 billion tax dollars to round up, prosecute and keep inmates behind bars.
Over the last year activists successfully waged campaigns to squeeze private prisons financially, pressuring half a dozen major banks to cut off their financing. Investors pulled back too and that could keep the companies from growing.
Alexandra Wilkes with Day 1 Alliance, a trade association for three major private prison companies, says the industry grew from a need in the 1980s to address inhumane and overcrowded conditions in public corrections institutions. 
""Private-sector contractors are among the nation's leaders in providing incarcerated men and women with innovative re-entry programs to reduce recidivism, including faith-based programs that help inmates build life skills and relationships critical to successfully re-entering society. Our members have hundreds of dedicated chaplains on staff to help inmates practice their faith in prison, and work with faith groups and community organizations to meet the needs of those in their care,"" Wilkes tells CBN News.
Professor Pfaff says some private prisons do operate better than others, just like those in the public system, and points out state-owned prisons also have incentives to keep their doors open, it's just less apparent.    
However, no matter where inmates serve time, he encourages Americans to focus on the power of redemption.
""Jesus never wrote anybody off even at that very last moment, he didn't care what the person next to him on the cross was up there for and I think there's a very important lesson what he didn't say and what he didn't ask about how we should view even those who have done amongst the worst things possible that we should never just throw them away,"" Pfaff says.
Over the past decade, the overall prison rate has fallen by 15 percent, but America still locks up more people than any other country and private prisons appear here to stay – for now.

His campaign is organizing ""Make America Great Again"" rallies and they're expected to resume within the next couple weeks. 
Trump's rally schedule came to a sudden halt three months ago when the COVID-19 pandemic largely shuttered the nation, but the president has been eager to get back on the campaign trail and resume the rallies that have been the hallmark of his political career.
""Americans are ready to get back to action and so is President Trump. The Great American Comeback is real and the rallies will be tremendous,"" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said Monday in a statement. ""You'll again see the kind of crowds and enthusiasm that Sleepy Joe Biden can only dream of.""
Campaign officials said the precise format and locations for the rallies remain to be determined, as many states — and federal guidelines — still caution against holding mass gatherings, particularly in enclosed spaces. It was unclear what specific precautions would be implemented to protect the 73-year-old president and attendees from the potential spread of the coronavirus at rallies.
Trump rallies traditionally pack tens of thousands of people into arenas or outdoor amphitheaters in conditions that would struggle to meet social distancing guidelines.
The campaign says it's still working out the details on how they will address social distancing.
Trump announced last week that he was pulling the public portions of the 2020 GOP convention from Charlotte after North Carolina would not guarantee that he would be allowed to fill an arena with supporters. GOP officials are visiting other cities to determine where they could host the president's acceptance speech when he is renominated.
Trump is set to resume campaign fundraisers this week, with smaller high-dollar events in Dallas and at his private club in New Jersey. The roughly two dozen attendees at each fundraiser will be administered COVID-19 tests before entering the events, which will also benefit the Republican National Committee."

The coronavirus shutdown helped shove the United States into a recession. The downturn ended the longest economic expansion since the Civil War.
National research shows the economy began its turn for the worse back in February. 
The Labor Department reports 11.5 million layoffs in March, then 7.7 million more in April. 
Add to that, Energy Company BP just announced it will eliminate 10,000 jobs.  It's a cut of about 14% of its global workforce. The move comes after crude oil prices hit their lowest levels in decades. 
Still, President Trump is optimistic following the May jobs rebound of 2.5 million jobs added.
""I built the greatest economy in the World, the best in the U.S. ever had"" Trump tweeted. ""I am doing it again!"" 
2020 Democrat contender Joe Biden pushed back writing, ""Trump squandered a growing economy.""
How fast the nation bounces back could depend on how the states go about easing restrictions. 
Currently, all 50 states are in some phase of reopening. On Monday, some 400,000 people went back to work in New York City.
""It is the day we start to liberate ourselves from the disease,"" New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said. 
Federal Reserve officials met Tuesday and will announce the latest monetary policy decision tomorrow. This news comes as the 2020 deficit nears $2 trillion with some economists predicting the figure could double by year's end.

Why? Because of hundreds of thousands of regulations that carry criminal penalties.
What's the cost of locking so many people up? Hundreds of billions of dollars each year, paid for by you, the taxpayer.
Two major stories dominating the headlines for weeks find themselves at a controversial crossroad: The COVID-19 lockdowns and the ongoing protests following the death of George Floyd are bringing a renewed focus on law enforcement and Americans' freedom or lack of it. 
We first saw this when citizens who dared to break government quarantine orders or protested to reopen their states were threatened with criminal prosecution.
Timothy Head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition writes in The Hill that it's an example of ""a dangerous misuse of criminal law.""
""We're seeing that kind of heavy-handed approach across the country literally impacting every single human life in the United States of America right now,"" Head says.
And during this wave of civil unrest and protest, we've seen peaceful demonstrators, even journalists, arrested, pepper-sprayed, and shot with rubber bullets like criminals for exercising their constitutional rights. It's a demonstration – some say – of America's problem with overcriminalization.
John Malcolm of The Heritage Foundation says, ""If we end up criminalizing conduct that your average person wouldn't think was wrong, then people will all of a sudden lose respect for the rule of law.""
These are regulations people break unwittingly because it doesn't seem like behavior that would or should be criminal,
and they're everywhere.
In North Carolina, for example, counties, cities, and towns – even metropolitan sewerage districts – have the power to create ordinances that automatically carry the punishment of a class three misdemeanor.
And on the federal level, efforts to count the number of regulations with criminal penalties have been abandoned –  because it's an impossible task.
""I've seen the estimate of at least 300,000. It's probably more like 400- or 500,000 regulations that carry criminal penalties,"" Malcolm says.
The fact is it's hard to get them off the books. President Trump could sign an executive order directing agencies to get rid of regulations with criminal penalties, but it wouldn't happen overnight, to do it legally would take years.
So, during this time of civil unrest, there's something that actually unites Americans.
""There is no one in the United States over the age of 18 who cannot be indicted for some federal crime. That is not an exaggeration,"" says John Baker, a retired Louisiana State University law professor.
For years, in a number of cities from Flint to Shreveport, wearing saggy pants was criminalized. Those regulations disproportionately targeted young black men for sporting a popular fashion trend, despite its controversy.
Head says, ""When the same law is applied differently or has different impacts on different constituencies and communities it makes all of us fundamentally suspicious of the system.""
And that suspicion has reached a boiling point.
""We don't want no more police. Is that clear? We don't want people with guns toting around in our communities, shooting us down,"" said one protester at a rally over the weekend in Minnesota.
In New York, the nation's largest city, Major Bill de Blasio vows to cut police funding.
In Minneapolis, the city council has voted to dismantle its police department. ""Our commitment is to end our toxic relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department, to end policing as we know it,"" City Council Member Lisa Bender said to protesters during a recent rally.
In the midst of this debate over policing and crime, many Americans are hopeful the nation's problems with overcriminalization will begin to be addressed.
Beaumont, TX NAACP President Rev. Michael Cooper says, ""When light shows up, darkness has to go away, so we are hoping that with all this light all the darkness will go away and stay away.""

The two candidates are both rejecting calls to defund the police.
""No, I don't support defunding the police,"" Biden said.

President Donald Trump said he's ""appalled"" by the idea.
""There won't be defunding, there won't be dismantling of our police,"" Trump said.
House and Senate Democrats then unveiled a sweeping police and criminal justice reform bill. Among other measures, it would ban choke-holds and no-knock warrants, give state attorneys general more independence to investigate alleged abuses, and make it easier for people to recover damages from police when their rights are violated.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, ""Today with the 'Justice in Policing Act,' the Congress is standing with those fighting for justice and taking action.""

""This man whose death has changed the world – he's changed the world. You have to come. You know you have to. I can't explain it,"" one mourner said.
The former police officer charged with murdering Floyd, Derek Chauvin, made a court appearance in Minneapolis via video feed and had his bail set at $1.25 million. 
Joe Biden met privately for more than an hour with Floyd's family, including his daughter Gianna. 
The protests and riots stemming from Floyd's death at the hands of police are taking center stage on the presidential campaign.
A new CNN survey released Monday shows Joe Biden with a whopping 14 point lead over the president, 55 to 41 percent. 
And Democrats hope to use the uproar over the George Floyd killing against President Trump.  But on CBN News' Faith Nation program, Chief Political Analyst David Brody said Biden's opposition to defunding the police pits him against the far left of his own party, which he needs to win the White House. 
""Joe Biden just said, 'No I don't want to defund the police,' so he's putting his marker down in the center, the more moderate lane, but that's not going to work for the far left,"" Brody warned, ""They're very active, they're very loud, and Biden needs all of them to mobilize against Trump, and if he starts to fracture with them, that's a problem in November. ""
Meanwhile, a Minneapolis court has ordered the city to implement a series of structural changes in policing, banning neck restraints, chokeholds, and requiring officers to report ""unauthorized use of force"" by fellow officers.

The panel continues its probe into how multiple mistakes were made leading up to the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Tense questions greeted the headline witness former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.  He tried to explain that while he was accountable for mistakes in the infamous Operation Crossfire Hurricane, he should not be blamed for them. CBN News spoke to one expert who begs to differ.
""Every application that I approved appeared to be justified based on the facts it alleged.  And the FBI was supposed to be following protocols to ensure that every fact was verified,"" Rosenstein explained.  
Rosenstein took a lot of heat from members of the committee.  That’s because he approved so-called FISA warrant applications that ultimately led to the investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election and any link to the Trump campaign.  An inspector general's report found several application violations, including some with misinformation sent to judges who would approve those applications.
""This investigation, Crossfire Hurricane, was one of the most corrupt biased criminal investigations in the history of the FBI and we’d like to see something done about it,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said. 
""Who should we hold responsible, what do you want this committee to do? The other side wants us to do nothing they don’t want to talk about it they’re happy for these abuses to go on apparently.  What do you suggest that we do?,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO).
""I think Senator there are issues of accountability and blame. I’m accountable. m here being chastised by you as part of my accountability, but the question is blame. What went wrong, Rosenstein answered.

Adding fuel to the fire, this recently released FBI document started the whole investigation.  Notice that it’s from controversial FBI agent Peter Strzok to Peter Strzok, and approved by Peter Strzok.  Experts say it was poorly constructed and did not make a case.
However, Democrats contend that the IG’s report indicated Operation Crossfire Hurricane was justified despite the errors and led to findings of Russian meddling. 
""Congress should not conduct politically motivated investigations designed to attack or help any presidential candidate, Mr. Chairman, Period,"" said Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA). This would be true at any time but even more so now that we’re facing the killing of George Floyd and we’re in the middle of a pandemic.
""We’re sitting here showing the American public that we argue with each other very well while Rome is burning,"" said Sen. Corey Booker (D-NJ). 
Former Assistant Federal Prosecutor John O’Connor told CBN’s Gary Lane, America can’t let this ride.
""There was FISA abuse in the fact that we know the court was lied to multiple times in multiple ways.  And everyone that had any idea in the falsity and that is the concealment in the presentation should be prosecuted,"" O’Connor said. ""We have a whole battery of wrongdoing here and it is sickening. It’s more and more of a rats nest every time we get a new disclosure.""
Committee Chairman Graham says here’s the reason to continue probing.
""If you knew then what you know now would you sign the warrant application?"" he asked.  
""No I would not, Rosenstein replied. 
Senator Graham wants to subpoena more than 50 other potential witnesses. Democrats call that overkill and they will call witnesses of their own. Of course, this is all in addition to the ongoing criminal investigation into the origins of Crossfire Hurricane being done by US Attorney John Durham.

0,2020-06-06T09:15:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/june/biden-formally-clinches-democratic-presidential-nomination,Biden Formally Clinches Democratic Presidential Nomination,"WASHINGTON (AP) - Joe Biden has formally clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, setting him up for a bruising challenge to President Donald Trump that will play out against the unprecedented backdrop of a pandemic, economic collapse and civil unrest.
“It was an honor to compete alongside one of the most talented groups of candidates the Democratic party has ever fielded,"" Biden said in a statement Friday night, ”and I am proud to say that we are going into this general election a united party.""
  
The former vice president has effectively been his party's leader since his last challenger in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders, ended his campaign in April. But Biden pulled together the 1,991 delegates needed to become the nominee Friday after seven states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries Tuesday.
  
Biden reached the threshold three days after the primaries because several states, overwhelmed by huge increases in mail ballots, took days to tabulate results. A team of analysts at The Associated Press then parsed the votes into individual congressional districts. Democrats award most delegates to the party’s national convention based on results in individual congressional districts.
  
Biden now has 1,995 delegates, with contests still to come in eight states and three U.S. territories.
  
The moment was met with little of the traditional fanfare as the nation confronts overlapping crises. While Biden has started to venture out more this week, the coronavirus pandemic has largely confined him to his Wilmington, Delaware, home for much of the past three months.
  
The country faces the worst rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. And civil unrest that harkens back to the 1960s has erupted in dozens of cities following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.
  
It's a confluence of events that no U.S. leader has faced in modern times, made all the more complicated by a president who has at times antagonized the protesters and is eager to take the fight to Biden. 
  
“This is a difficult time in America’s history,” Biden said Friday night. “And Donald Trump’s angry, divisive politics is no answer. The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that can bring us together.”
  
Biden spent 36 years in the Senate before becoming Barack Obama's vice president. This is 77-year-old Biden's third bid for the presidency and his success in capturing the Democratic nomination was driven by strong support from black voters.
  
He finished an embarrassing fourth place in the overwhelmingly white Iowa caucuses that kicked off the nomination process in February. Biden fared little better in the New Hampshire primary, where his standing was so low that he left the state before polls closed on election night to instead rally black voters in South Carolina.
  
His rebound began in the more diverse caucuses in Nevada but solidified in South Carolina, where Biden stomped Sanders, his nearest rival, by nearly 29 points. He followed that with a dominant showing three days later during the Super Tuesday contests, taking 10 of the 14 states.
  
Biden's strong showing in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Texas reinforced his status as the preferred Democratic candidate of African American voters - but the relationship has not been without its strained moments. After a tense exchange with an influential black radio host, Biden took sharp criticism for suggesting that African American voters still deciding between him and Trump “ain't black.”
  
That comment, and protests that have spread nationwide, have increased pressure on Biden to pick an African American running mate. He has already committed to picking a woman as a vice-presidential candidate.
  
Black voters are unlikely to back Trump over Biden by a wide margin. A recent Fox News poll shows just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of the president compared with 75% who favorably view Biden. 
  
But Biden must ensure that black voters are motivated to show up to the polls in November, especially in critical swing states that narrowly went for Trump in 2016. 
  
At one point, the Democratic primary included dozens of candidates of different races, genders and generations and an openly gay man. The contest was dominated by debate over unapologetically progressive ideas, including fully government-funded health care under “Medicare for All” and a sweeping proposal to combat climate change known as the “Green New Deal.” 
  
Biden prevailed by mostly offering more moderate approaches that he argued would make him more electable against Trump.
  
He refused to budge on his rejection of universal health care and some of the Green New Deal's most ambitious provisions to combat climate change.
  
Since clinching the nomination, however, Biden has worked to build his appeal among progressives, forming joint task forces with Sanders' campaign to find common ground on key issues like health care, the economy, and the environment. Biden has also embraced a plan to forgive millions of Americans' student debt, meaning that he clinches the nomination as easily the most liberal standard-bearer the Democratic Party has ever had. 
  
Biden's embrace of his party's left flank could help him consolidate a Democratic base that remained deeply divided after 2016 primary and ultimately hurt Hillary Clinton in her defeat to Trump. But it could also undermine Biden's attempts to rebuild the Obama coalition, which is often loosely defined as minorities and young people, as well as educated Americans and some working-class voters. 
  
The former vice president has sought, since announcing his candidacy, to cast the election as a battle “for the soul of the nation,"" and promised to restore order and dignity to the White House while rehabilitating the U.S. image on the world stage. Such an approach, though, necessarily focuses on being more of an alternative to Trump than offering radically new political ideas. And that further underscores Biden's difficult task of trying to unite his party's base while appealing to voters from far beyond it. 
  
“I am going to spend every day between now and November 3rd fighting to earn the votes of Americans all across this great country,” Biden promised Friday, “so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation, and make sure that as we rebuild our economy, everyone comes along.”

0,2020-06-04T15:30:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/june/us-goes-after-chinas-concentration-camps-and-cultural-genocide-against-uyghurs-nbsp,US Goes After China's Concentration Camps and 'Cultural Genocide' Against Uyghurs ,"WASHINGTON - For years the Chinese government has terrorized its Uyghur population and now the US aims to do something about it.
President Trump is expected to sign the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act into law this week - legislation that passed Congress overwhelmingly.
""This is the first time a legislative body around the world in Uyghur's human history passed a significant bill to address Uyghur's political, economic, social, and religious rights,"" says Nury Turkel, who was instrumental in getting the legislation passed and was just appointed to the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).
""With this law, the Uyghur law in place, the administration will be directed to impose the global Magnitsky sanctions that go after Chinese officials who have been responsible for persecuting religious and ethnic minorities in China,"" he explains during an interview with CBN News.
Since the spring of 2017, China has been transferring Uyghurs living in China's Xinjiang province into so-called re-education camps that international observers call modern-day concentration camps.
Uyghurs are an ethnic minority in China. Most practice Islam. In recent years, China's communist regime has turned up the heat in its war against people of faith - specifically targeting Christians and Muslims.
""They're forcing Uyghurs and others to denounce their religious practices and they've been forcing Uyghurs to go through or adopt a non-traditional, non-religious way of life which is much more common for the ruling Hun Chinese people,"" says Turkel.
The bill awaiting the president's signature also requires the administration to report on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, including formal estimates of the number of Uyghurs and others detained in concentration camps. Today Turkel estimates three million are being held against their will.
As a naturalized American citizen, he says the legislation ""shows the best of my country.""

For him, it's personal. Turkel is an Uyghur Muslim who was actually born in a prison camp and understands the devastating effects of religious persecution firsthand.
He says what's happening in China today is modern-day cultural genocide.
""When a government regime collectively punishes an ethnic group targeting their women and children mainly because of their ethnic background and religious practices meet the definition of cultural genocide.""
Over the past year, the Chinese government has ""graduated"" thousands of Uyghur detainees and assigned them to work in factories.
Reports indicate American companies operating in China such as Nike, Calvin Klein, and Apple either directly employ or source from suppliers suspected of using Uyghur detainees as forced labor.
USCIRF believes the exploitation of Uyghur and other Muslims has become so systematic that US customs officials should assume all goods produced in Xinjiang are the product of forced labor.
Several lawmakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R) and Reps. Jim McGovern (D) and Jennifer Wexton (D), have introduced legislation to address this.
""This is 2020. People should not be punished based on what they worship, what kind of lifestyle that they maintain, and what kind of people that they're married to. The Chinese government is even forcing Uyghur women to marry Hun ethnic Chinese individuals with incentives and even some instances threats,"" Turkel says.
Religious freedom advocates say the plight of Uyghur Muslims in China is something that should concern all people of faith.
""Since the crisis came to surface, we've been receiving an enormous amount of support from the Christian communities, Jewish communities; but what is lacking is the other faith groups. They also should speak out. No one should be persecuted for their religious practices. It's a God-given right. People should be able to practice and it's a matter of privacy and government should have no business in people's privacy when they're worshipping and when they're praying,"" concludes Turkel.

0,2020-06-04T10:45:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/june/justice-dept-to-news-george-floyd-case-is-very-disturbing-and-a-top-priority,Justice Dept to CBN News: George Floyd Case Is 'Very Disturbing' and a Top Priority,"WASHINGTON - The head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division tells CBN News the George Floyd case is a top priority. The DOJ is now deciding whether to proceed with federal charges against the police officer accused in this tragic incident that has led to protests and riots across America. 
The video of George Floyd slowly dying after having his neck brutally pressed by an officer's knee until he was no longer breathing is an image seared into our collective minds. Eric Dreiband, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, was horrified by it too. 
""I've watched the video of what happened and led to Mr. Floyd's death,"" Dreiband tells CBN News. ""I will say the video is very disturbing and very troubling.""
As the head of the Civil Rights Division, Mr. Dreiband will oversee whether federal civil rights charges will be filed in the case. President Trump wants the situation expedited and Dreiband is working towards that end.
""The investigation is a high priority of ours,"" he says. ""We're also working with state and local officials, but we will make an independent judgment about whether or not federal criminal charges or other action is warranted by the federal government.""
If DOJ moves forward, it would be under what is known as ""Color of Law"" prosecution. Law enforcement officers are generally given quite a bit of authority and leeway to safeguard justice, but it's a crime for anyone serving under ""Color of Law"" protection to violate the constitutional or federally protected rights of an individual. 
""We've prosecuted many, many police officers, other law enforcement officials around the country under that statute and criminal cases and we will continue to do that,"" Dreiband tells CBN News.
Critics aren't so sure there will be a good outcome. They point to past reluctance by the current administration to pursue federal investigations against law enforcement agencies. Ultimately, time will tell if this case leads to federal civil rights charges, but the larger issue remains the state of race relations in America. 
""We have, I think, in our country both a proud and a tragic history when it comes to civil rights issues,"" Dreiband acknowledges. ""I think what I've tried to do…is to convey that here in this country all Americans are equal before the law, they are entitled to equal justice under the law, and that our goal is to account for and be mindful of the tragedies that have happened in our country; the history of lynching and slavery and other things, but at the same time to acknowledge that many, many people in our history have acted in a heroic way to bring about civil rights protections for all Americans.""
For Dreiband, one of those brave citizens is abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery and became known as the father of the civil rights movement in America. His portrait hangs near the assistant attorney general's office. 
""I think as I go about my job on a day to day basis, I always look at the portrait that we have of Frederick Douglass and try to take inspiration from that.""

Wednesday was the first of a series of hearings Republican senators are pursuing in order to figure out if the evidence that launched the Mueller investigation was lawful.
""They're people on our side of the aisle who believe that this investigation, Crossfire Hurricane, was one of the most corrupt, biased criminal investigations,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). 
Graham charged he wants to get to the bottom of what he thinks is a major abuse of power by the Obama administration.
The hearing centered on new information that revealed errors and admissions in applications for warrants to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
""If you knew then what you knew now would you have signed the warrant application?"", Graham asked Rosenstein.
""No, I would not,"" he replied.
Rosenstein defended the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller saying that was the best way to determine what Russia did in the 2016 election.
""As we now know, the eventual conclusions were that Russians committed crimes seeking to influence the election, and Americans did not conspire with them,"" he told the committee. 
Democrats argued Republicans are wasting time when they should be focused on issues like racism in America's justice system or contact tracing and privacy issues.
""Instead, we're taking up the Mueller report. An investigation that was completed a year ago. Why?,"" Sen. Dick Durbin asked.
Democrats claim Republicans are trying to use this as political fodder ahead of the 2020 election.
""Congress should not conduct politically motivated investigations,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
Senator plans to request an additional 53 witnesses to come before the committee. Democrats say they were not consulted on these additional witnesses, and if the committee plans bring forth more people, they'd like to add a few of their own names to the list like Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort.

Steve King won't be returning to Congress. Republicans in northwest Iowa voted King out in Tuesday's primary.
King had served nine terms in Congress but had a history of making controversial remarks on white supremacy and immigrants.
Some Republicans had warned King could lose the general election in November, and they didn't like the controversy he brought to the party.
 
Early last year, King questioned how expressions like ""white nationalist"" and ""white supremacist"" became offensive in the US. 
""White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"" King asked during an interview with The New York Times. ""Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"" 
Shortly after the interview, King stated that he is not a white nationalist or white supremacist.  
""I want to make one thing abundantly clear; I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define,"" King said. ""Further, I condemn anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology which saw in its ultimate expression the systematic murder of 6 million innocent Jewish lives.""
""It's true that like the Founding Fathers I am an advocate for Western Civilization's values, and that I profoundly believe that America is the greatest tangible expression of these ideals the World has ever seen. Under any fair political definition, I am simply a Nationalist,"" he added. 
King, who served in Congress for nearly two decades, was defeated in the Iowa Republican Primary by state Sen. Randy Feenstra.
With 96 percent of precincts reporting, Feenstra led the vote at 46 percent against King's 36 percent.
""I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support over the past 17 months that made tonight possible and I thank Congressman King for his decades of public service,"" Feenstra said. 
In the presidential race, Joe Biden is one step closer to claiming the Democratic nomination for president.
As expected, the former vice president won all seven primaries held Tuesday. That's no surprise since the other Democratic contenders have dropped out.
Tuesday's elections were marked by confusion over a large number of mail-in ballots due to coronavirus restrictions.

Northam's Medical School Yearbook,"ABOVE: Jack Jenkins, national reporter for the Religion News Service appeared on the Tuesday edition of CBN News' Faith Nation to talk about Falwell's apology.  Faith Nation is seen weekdays on the CBN News Channel. For a programming schedule, click here. 
Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. apologized Monday for a tweet that upset African American members of the Liberty community. The tweet had been aimed at Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, but it included a racist photo from Northam's medical school yearbook page decades ago. 
""After listening to African American LU leaders and alumni over the past week and hearing their concerns, I understand that by tweeting an image to remind all of the governor's racist past I actually refreshed the trauma that image had caused and offended some by using the image to make a political point,"" he tweeted Monday. 
""Based on our long relationships, they uniformly understood this was not my intent, but because it was the result,"" Falwell continued, ""I have deleted the tweet and apologize for any hurt my effort caused, especially within the African American community."" 
A group of African-American alumni of Liberty University called ""LU Alumni for Biblical Diversity"" called out Falwell earlier this month for years of behavior they call ""infantile"" and ""incendiary"" topped off by his tweet which was seen by many as racially insensitive and not Christ-like.
The group - made up of African-American pastors, ministry leaders, and former athletes who graduated from the university - was upset about his May 27th tweet complaining about Northam's (D) mandate that citizens wear masks to combat the coronavirus.
Falwell tweeted if he's ordered to wear one he'll only comply if a ""picture of Governor Blackface himself is on it!"" referring to a picture on the governor's medical school yearbook page that shows one student in blackface embracing another wearing a KKK hood and robe. 
The shocking photo surfaced in early 2019. After first apologizing for appearing in blackface, Northam recanted saying he couldn't remember doing it and suggested the photo was printed under his name by mistake. 
I was adamantly opposed to the mandate from @GovernorVA requiring citizens to wear face masks until I decided to design my own. If I am ordered to wear a mask, I will reluctantly comply, but only if this picture of Governor Blackface himself is on it!#VEXIT#EndLockdownNow pic.twitter.com/twu7r4rWhd
— Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) May 27, 2020
Falwell's tweet garnered more than 6,000 comments including one from Dan Smith who said, ""All people of color should reconsider their enrollment at Liberty University immediately.""
Megan McNinch responded, ""As a student at Liberty University Online I find this appalling! Someone else's bad decision in the past does not condone YOUR bad decision in the present. Statements like this make me embarrassed to be a student here.""
""While your tweet may have been in-jest about Virginia's Governor, it made light of our nation's painful history of slavery and racism. It is what we're called to reject as followers of Christ - 'Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place...'"" wrote the group of black alumni in the petition, quoting Ephesians 5:4.
""The reckless nature of this tweet is a microcosm of the past several years of divisive rhetoric that does not display the kind of Christian witness that the Gospel demands of us, nor does it represent the Christlike Leadership that Liberty University deserves. It has brought further disgrace to Jesus Christ and Liberty University,"" the petition states, which has garnered more than 37,000 signatures.
Falwell is a staunch supporter and ally of President Trump. The group says his tweets indicate he cares more about politics than Jesus Christ.
""It has become obvious to many that your heart is in politics more than Christian academia or ministry, so we would encourage you to leave the position of school president and pursue politics full-time,"" they write.
Signers of the petition say they can no longer in good faith encourage the students who worship at their churches and in their communities to attend LU or accept athletic scholarships. The alumni also say they'll stop making financial donations to the school.
""We ask you to withdraw your racist tweet immediately and make a public apology. If you decide to stay at Liberty, this coalition stands ready to meet with you in order to provide counsel on ways for LU to best move forward in these racially-charged and divisive times.""
They say their time at the university deeply impacted them and add, ""Our ultimate goal is for Jesus to be glorified in all that we say and do. We pray that is your desire as well.""

Trump stood in front of the church, raised a black Bible, and said: ""We have a great country. Greatest country in the world.""
 
The president's visit came after he said during a press conference at the White House that he would ""pay my respects to a very very special place.""
The Associated Press reported that law enforcement cleared the area of peaceful protesters with tear gas around 6:30 p.m. before the president's visit. 
 
Trump's decision to visit the damaged 200-year-old church located steps away from the White House drew mixed reactions, with critics calling it a photo-op.
 
Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde, who oversees St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington DC, said she was ""outraged.""
 
""The president did not pray when he came to St. John's, nor … did he acknowledge the agony of our country right now, and in particular, the people of color in our nation who wonder if anyone in public power will ever acknowledge their sacred work, and who are rightfully demanding an end to 400 years of systemic racism and white supremacy in our country,"" Budde told CNN.

George Floyd's Brother Condemns Riots: 'He Would Not Want You All to be Doing This'
Evangelist Franklin Graham Calls For Churches Across America to Pray For Peace During Protests
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement accusing Trump of ""tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation"" to ""pose for photos outside a church.""
 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) defended the president's decision to visit the church late Monday and called the protesters ""professional agitators.""
 
""They knew the street needed to be cleared before 7 pm curfew. But they deliberately stayed to trigger police action  [and]  get the story they wanted, that 'police attacked peaceful protestors',"" he tweeted. 
 
Evangelist Franklin Graham applauded Trump.
 
""Thank you, President Trump. God and His Word are the only hope for our nation,"" he said on Facebook. 
 
Protests have swept across the country since a video of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed Floyd went viral. 
 
Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer in the video, was on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as he repeatedly said ""I can't breathe.""
 
Floyd was pronounced dead soon after being taken to a hospital. 
 
Trump called the video ""horrible"" and Chauvin was charged with murder.
 
An independent autopsy determined Floyd's death to be a homicide. The cause of death was defined as ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.""
 
The medical examiner's office also found evidence of heart disease, fentanyl intoxication, and methamphetamine abuse, but the examiner did not cite them as contributing to Floyd's death.

0,2020-05-29T15:15:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2020/may/complete-victory-for-people-of-faith-il-gov-drops-mandates-placed-on-churches,'Complete Victory for People of Faith': IL Gov. Drops Mandates Placed on Churches,"Attorneys with the Thomas More Society, a not-for-profit, national public interest law firm, are claiming victory after the Illinois Department of Health backed off from earlier efforts to restrict church gatherings. The department has instead released a statement issuing ""COVID-19 Guidance for Places of Worship and Providers of Religious Services Overview."" 
The law firm filed three separate lawsuits against Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, charging religious discrimination and violations of the US and Illinois constitutions and Illinois' Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  Pritzker announced in his daily press briefing on Thursday that he's withdrawing mandates on Illinois churches and replacing them with health department ""guidelines"" for places of worship.
""This is a total and complete victory for people of faith,"" said Thomas More Society Vice President and Senior Counsel Peter Breen. ""Illinois' governor and his administration abused the COVID-19 pandemic to stomp on the religious liberty of the people of Illinois. By issuing guidelines only and not the previously announced mandatory restrictions, he has handed a complete victory to the churches in Illinois.""
""Today, people of faith across Illinois should breathe a little freer, as their government has finally recognized their fundamental freedom of religion,"" Breen continued. ""This right is written in the First Amendment to the US Constitution and it is critical to a self-governing democracy. But the pastors and churches of Illinois should not have had to file repeated lawsuits in state and federal courts to secure their basic rights. Today marks the end of a shameful chapter of discrimination by the government of the Land of Lincoln against houses of worship and religious leaders.""
Breen sees Pritzker's capitulation as a direct result of the three lawsuits, one by The Beloved Church in Lena, another by Jesus House Restoration Ministries in Urbana, and a third, filed May 27, by a group of five Lake County churches and their pastors. The Lake County case was set for a hearing on a Temporary Restraining Order on May 29, 2020. 
After the first lawsuit by The Beloved Church, Pritzker lifted restrictions on ""drive-in"" services and small group gatherings, and following the complaint filed by Jesus House Restoration Ministries, he removed restrictions on outdoor worship services. Now the governor has lifted all mandates against churches.
""Governor Pritzker had imposed various limits on church activities as part of his coronavirus stay-at-home orders. After each of the three Thomas More Society lawsuits, Pritzker reversed course and lifted restrictions that he had previously stated he would maintain,"" Breen noted. 
The guidelines issued by Pritzker's health officials state that their purpose is to provide ""guidance for places of worship and providers of religious services to support the safest possible environment for faith leaders, employees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers, as well as congregants, worshipers, and visitors."" 
The statement recommends ""Remote Services and Drive-In Services"" as the ""Safest Options,"" and urges social distancing, face masks, limiting capacity, as well as excluding singing, refreshments, and close physical contact. The document also details the recommended sanitation protocols."

Take conservative media mega house Prager University. Its videos have been viewed 3.4 billion times and counting, nearly four million people follow the group on Facebook, but a recent Facebook notification handicapped the organization.
An independent fact checker had flagged one of Prager's one-minute videos.
The video exposes a widely viewed video of an emaciated polar bear as a deception promoted by climate change activists. 
Facebook calls it fake news and to punish Prager it's limiting distribution of its posts in news feeds.
""What Facebook is doing - they're trying to keep their hands clean - and they're using these third party fact checkers to be the truth tellers and determine what is true and what is not, so unfortunately it's very easy to weaponize this and to target organizations like us at Prager U,"" Craig Strazzeri, Chief Marketing Officer at Prager U, tells CBN News.
This comes just days after Facebook appointed the first 20 members of its new Oversight Board. Only five members are American and that's raising red flags since the board has signaled an intention to adopt global, not American, norms on free speech.
""If you're going to pass judgment on American free speech then have Americans do it. It's still gonna be problematic, it's still gonna be a huge problem because it's gonna be dominated by leftists, but at least in theory they're grounded by the Constitution, not something that came out of Slovakia,"" said Brent Bozell, founder of the Media Research Center, during a recent press briefing.
President Trump is sounding the alarm tweeting, ""Republicans feel that social media platforms totally silence conservative voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we ever allow this to happen...clean up your act now!!!!""
The president has signed an executive order that removes the liability shield social media companies currently enjoy because they're considered neutral platforms. Trump says they're anything but.
""When they choose to fact check and what they choose to ignore or even promote is nothing more than a political activism group or political activism and it's inappropriate,"" the president told reporters in the Oval Office after he signed the order.
Overnight, Twitter posted a notice claiming the president violated its rules on ""glorifying violence"" flagging a tweet about the ongoing violent protests in Minneapolis.
This came after the platform added a fact check warning to two of his tweets about mail-in voting.
 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently took a different tone than Twitter or even his own newly appointed oversight board telling CNBC, ""I don't think that Facebook or internet platforms in general should be arbiters of truth."" 
    
The easy solution would be for the president, Prager U, and other conservative groups to get off the platforms that are censoring them, but that would take them out of the cyber marketplace of ideas where they can potentially reach billions.
For instance, research shows 70 percent of people who watch a Prager U video change their minds about that issue.
    
""We know that when people hear conservative ideas, conservative values that they will be one: open to them, and two: convinced, and we can change their mind,"" says Strazzeri.
 
The reality is when you combine social media giants and Google, they are the internet - it's hard to use it without them. That's why Prager U and other groups plan to keep fighting to be heard, viewed, and shared.

""They’ve had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences,"" Trump said of social media companies as he signed the order. ""There is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction.”
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany also explained in advance, ""The President will take action so that big tech does not stifle free speech and that the rights of all Americans to speak and tweet is protected.""

Who Checks Twitter's Biased Fact Checkers? Twitter Slaps 'Fact Check Warning' on Trump Tweets, Backlash Ensues
Conservatives have long argued that companies like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are censoring their messages. The president and Republican lawmakers believe the companies are abusing a statute that allows them to remove 'objectionable' content from their sites. 
The order makes it easier for them to be held liable. And it comes on the heels of Twitter applying a fact-checker feature to Trump's tweets about mail-in ballots. 
""So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that mail-in ballots are not subject to fraud,"" Trump tweeted. ""How stupid, there are examples and cases all over the place. Our election process will become badly tainted and laughing stock all over the world."" 
Trump has even threatened to shut down Twitter and social media platforms that he argues censor conservative voices. 
""Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves,"" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said. ""More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see why behind our actions."" 
The White House says the order aims to crack down on online platforms that hand-pick speech that Americans access and convey online. "

Even though she has a significant job with a prestigious title, to better understand her path to the White House, you need to understand her overall view of life.
 ""I believe God put me in this place for a purpose and for a reason like he does with each and every life,"" McEnany tells CBN News. ""We're all here for a reason.""
On a daily basis, her purpose is to present, explain, and defend the president's decisions and policies. Her preparation shows, as she often turns the tables on a hostile media challenging the fairness, accuracy, and narratives of their stories.

Why Did Christians Vote for Trump in 2016, and Will They Vote for Him Again in 2020?
Kayleigh McEnany on God and Trump: 'Prayer Made a Lot of Difference in the Election'
At just 32 years old, McEnany is one of the youngest ever to hold this position. While the Harvard Law graduate looks calm, cool, and collected behind the legendary podium, she tells CBN News it was a different story before her very first briefing. ""I was in panic mode right before,"" she reveals. That led to an impromptu West Wing prayer session. ""I was just rattled and extremely nervous and feeling a lot of anxiety. I called my mom and on speakerphone, my family and we all prayed together…and all of a sudden I took a deep breath and after those prayers, moved forward. I felt such strength, went in and talked to the president, and then walked out and did the job that only could be done if God was there helping you along the way."" 
Former Press Secretary a 'Wise Mentor'
She also got some help that day from former press secretary Sarah Sanders. ""Sarah is a wise mentor,"" McEnany says. ""In fact, that day when I was so nervous before the first press briefing, it was her texts that helped me quite a lot in that moment, because she sent me a 'Jesus Calling' devotional.""
Raised in a Southern Baptist home and attending a Florida Catholic all-girls school, the call of Jesus has always been near. As a teenager, Kayleigh walked down the aisle of her church to give her life to Jesus Christ. Then, in her 20s something happened that deepened her faith even more. 
""I was going through a hard time in New York and I was going to a great church in New York,"" she explains. ""I remember feeling very lonely. It was when I first started my young professional life and I remember getting a call. I never answered numbers I didn't know but I answered that day, and it said, 'hey, this is the Journey Church. We feel like we need to pray for you right now, how can we pray for you?' It was at a distinct moment that I needed to hear from Christ and I felt that he communicated to me through my church and it's that moment I think my faith became even more real.""
 
Faith to Overcome Adversity
That faith has helped Kayleigh deal with adversity, especially when she found out her mom and other women in her extended family carried a gene that makes breast cancer very likely. She got tested in college and then got a phone call. ""It was close to Christmas Eve, it was right around that time and just crying because I got a call from the doctor saying you have this genetic mutation. I didn't know what to do with it."" 
For the next decade, Kayleigh considered prevention in the form of a double mastectomy but wanted to wait until she could go through it with a future soul mate. Enter Sean Gilmartin, whom she married in 2017. A year after their marriage vows, she took the pre-emptive plunge. ""I had a nipple-sparing mastectomy and they removed my breast tissue."" McEnany tells CBN News."" I'm able to say today that I will never get breast cancer. My chances are like .001 percent because of that choice."" To mark the occasion, she wore socks with bright lemons on them, reinforcing the message that when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
EXCLUSIVE: Kayleigh McEnany's Emotional Tribute to Ravi Zacharias 
Ever since then, she's been in the lemonade-making business. She joined CNN as a conservative voice, outnumbered but standing her ground; became a top GOP official with the Republican National Committee, and was the top campaign spokeswoman for the 2020 Trump Re-election campaign. But the sweetest moment came with the birth of her baby girl. Blake, born in late 2019 joined mom on the campaign trail at times and has even made an appearance or two inside The White House. 
Balancing Family and Career
For now, husband Sean plays the role of stay at home dad in Florida and her family, who lives nearby, pitches in, all while dealing with her high-stress day job. ""It is a balance,"" she says, admitting that it's a tough sacrifice on all sides. ""But I know at the end of the day, if I give Blake the same faith upbringing and relationship with Jesus Christ that my parents gave me, she will be an unstoppable woman of faith in whatever she decides to do.""
Blake will have a pretty good role model on that front. For example, McEnany is always finding time for Jesus. Just recently, she led weekly Bible studies while with the Trump campaign. ""We would pray and read the Word,"" McEnany said. ""It just gave a little pep in our step because these days are demanding, they're challenging, they're long in politics, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, that's the nature of the job. It was a little rod of lightning, of just energy and joy in our day.""

These days, it's not always so joyful when she looks out into the briefing room. When asked if a strong conservative Christian woman supporting Donald Trump drives the media up a wall, she answers directly. ""I think that's right. People are attacked for their faith, not just me, but Christian men and women across this country. It's unfortunate but I think we found a real voice in President Trump who stood for religious freedom and pro-life and [has] given us this boldness. It was at Harvard Law School when I felt attacked as a conservative and as a Christian that I realized it was that megaphone and that kind of boldness we needed and that kind of fighter we needed to represent the Christian community.""
 
This leads us to McEnany's life here and now for this role of a lifetime. And while she works for the commander-in-chief, she ultimately plays to an almighty audience of one. ""My mission in life is that when I pass that He will look at me and say, 'well done good and faithful servant,'"" she said. ""If I can end my life that way, it doesn't matter what the people say on the way there.""

That makes nearly 41 million unemployment applications since the lockdowns began.
COVID-19's cost has not only hit the economy, it's left many American families grieving lost loved ones. Today's jobless numbers come as the US death toll from the virus has just passed 100,000.
Meanwhile, most Americans are ready to go back to work, but some argue that congressional relief is tempting many to stay home. The CARES Act boosted unemployment payments by $600 a week giving some people a higher monthly income than they'd make at their jobs.
In their latest House-passed relief bill, Democrats want to extend those payments through January of next year. The Trump administration believes the increase discourages people from going back to work.
On CBN News's Faith Nation program, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware said Senate Republicans have made it clear they don't like the Democrat proposals.
""When the Senate gets back into session next week, we'll be debating vigorously about what makes the most sense. Is it extending the small business loans? Is it extending unemployment insurance? Is it extending the individual stimulus checks that went out once to about 80 percent of Americans?"" Coons said.
""In the end, this is going to be a subject of vigorous negotiations between the administration, the House, and the Senate,"" he said.
Sen. Coons is also working with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham on legislation to encourage nations to close wet markets, which slaughter and sell wild animals. The coronavirus is believed to have started its spread from a wet market in Wuhan, China.

That's if Democrat Gov. Roy Cooper can't quickly guarantee full attendance will be allowed inside the Spectrum Center – Charlotte's Sports Arena.
The president had tweeted his demands to know about the convention on Monday.
Now a city councilman in Charlotte, NC is telling President Trump to forget about it, saying the Republican convention can't be held as planned. 
""There's no way for the governor at this point to say he could have an arena full of people or that Charlotte could have 50,000 people coming into town for any event,"" Charlotte City Councilman Larken Egleston told CNN. ""And frankly, I think the only thing you can say definitively is that wouldn't be responsible three months from now.""
Egleston says President Trump must recognize the unavoidable changes that await if the convention is held in North Carolina.
""If we're going to host this convention, it's going to have to look very different than we thought it was going to, and the President should acknowledge that,"" Egleston added.
The convention is expected to bring tens of thousands of visitors to the city on Aug. 24-27. 
Right now, North Carolina's entertainment centers remain closed as the state enters phase two of reopening. It's also experiencing its highest spike in cases since the pandemic started.
On the Democrat side, the presumptive nominee former Vice President Joe Biden said it's ""hard to envision"" an in-person Democratic National Convention taking place this year, as originally planned.
""The fact is, it may have to be different,"" Biden said.
Biden spokesman, Bill Russo explained that the campaign is hesitant to make a firm decision over the convention until more data is made available on the pandemic. 
""We are considering a variety of formats for this to take place, but we are certain that in the end it will capture the enthusiasm and spirit that we have to making Donald Trump a one-term president and transforming our country,"" Russo said.
Joe Solmonese, the chief executive of the Democratic National Convention highlighted there are still many uncertainties and he will continue to be open about the process.
""I can understand why people are more drawn to a message that gives a sense that trouble is behind us and the show must go on, but we have been and will always be transparent and honest with people about our planning,"" he told the New York Times.
Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says he will continue to pursue plans for the convention to take place during the week of August 17. 
""I can't be distracted by the naysayer's who say, 'let's just throw in the towel, because I'm not throwing in the towel,"" Barrett said. ""We know that the Democrats are going to nominate a presidential candidate, Joe Biden, and that's going to happen in Milwaukee. And I am going to do whatever I can to make that a success."""

The president's announcement came as new questions surfaced about hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug Trump touted as a possible 'game-changer' treatment for the COVID-19 virus. 
A new study published on Friday by the medical journal The Lancet reveals it's linked to a much higher risk of death in coronavirus patients. 
To top that, the FDA has put the onus on healthcare professionals when it comes to hydroxychloroquine, warning against using it outside hospitals or clinical trials because it could cause heart problems. 
Despite the warnings, Trump's been taking hydroxychloroquine for nearly two weeks. He said White House physician Dr. Sean Coley determined the 'potential benefit' from the drug 'outweighed the relative risk.' 
Medical experts warn there could be a second wave of COVID 19 as states continue to ease social distancing and restrictions this holiday weekend.
""Our healthcare system is at a critical point right now,"" said Montgomery, AL, Mayor Steven Reed. ""Our healthcare system is at a critical point right now. Right now, if you're from Montgomery and you need an ICU bed, you're in trouble."" 
""Whether it's ember or a flame, we are going to put it out,"" Trump said. ""But we're not closing our country.""
Contradicting the commander-in-chief, CDC Director Robert Redfield is not ruling out a second lockdown if the country faces a spike in new cases. 
Religious leaders around the country applauded the president's action on social media.
Jentezen Franklin, the senior pastor of  Free Chapel, wrote, Thank you Mr President! @realDonaldTrump  You always have the back of people of Faith!!! We appreciate this very much. We will use wisdom about reopening but it’s our call not the governments!!!!

The Rev.

Tim Scott Fires Back After Biden Says You 'Ain't Black' if You Vote for Trump,"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said Friday voters “ain’t black” if they cast their ballots for President Donald Trump. Republican Sen. Tim Scott, the first African-American senator from South Carolina, had a few words for the former vice president.
Biden made the comments during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club” radio show with host Charlamagne tha God.
“Well, I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or for Trump, then you ain’t black,” he told Charlamagne after the host pressured him to choose a black woman as his running mate because “black people saved your political life in the primaries this year” and “have things they want from you.”
In response, Scott pointed out 1.3 million black Americans voted for Trump in 2016. Biden, he continued, “told every single one of us we ‘ain’t black.’”
“I’d say I’m surprised,” he continued, “but it’s sadly par for the course for Democrats to take the black community for granted and brow beat those that don’t agree.”
Stacey Abrams, the woman who lost Georgia’s gubernatorial race in 2018 and has continually argued the election was unfair, has for weeks been pushing herself as the best choice to be Biden’s running mate.
“We have to win the election,” Abrams, who is African-American, told The Atlantic. “And I would point out that I ran the most successful campaign to engage the communities we need to build the broadest coalition necessary in 2020, because what we are going to see on the ground is that this is going to be a campaign unlike anything that’s been run before.”
FAITHWIRE   Sen. Tim Scott’s Powerful Easter Message: ‘The Church Might Be Empty, But the Tomb Is Empty, Too’
Ultimately, Biden told Charlamagne he is “not acknowledging” anybody being considered for veep, but conceded there are “multiple black women” on his list of possible running mates.
As for Scott, during an interview last month with Faithwire, the Republican senator praised the way the Trump administration has handled the coronavirus pandemic.
“The one thing that’s crystal clear is the administration’s response has been really positive,” said Scott, noting he was working with the president’s team on how to best disseminate more information about the virus to those in the African-American community.
The 54-year-old Scott, who is a Christian, said he is hopeful about the future.
“From the foundation of this nation to this pandemic,” he said, “the one place we’ve always turned when the chips were down, when everything was going to be counted, we turned to the Lord, the author and finisher of our faith.”

The CDC expects it to hit when the weather cools down again this fall and winter.
However, the president says it will be handled much differently. 
""Whether it's an ember or a flame we're gonna put it out, but we're not closing our country,"" he told reporters.
Trump says the pandemic proves America must be strong and committed to continue bringing jobs back from China and other countries.
""I want to get our country back to normal,"" he said before boarding Marine One to travel to Michigan Thursday.
Still, as people return to their daily activities, experts urge vigilance since there are concerns a new wave of cases will emerge in the coming weeks as the economy gradually reopens.
""Now is not the time to tempt fate,"" says Dr. Anthony Fauci with the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
With all 50 states now reopening, there are signs of the new normal everywhere.
At a high school in Hoover, Alabama, 400 students graduated standing six feet apart while wearing masks.
In California, Yosemite Park won't open until next month, but businesses around it that rely on its tourists are opening their doors. 
Like many destination towns, the coming months are crucial to their bottom lines.
 
""This is our peak time. So from Memorial day to Labor Day weekend, this is where we make our money. If we don't have that it's going to put a dent in our local economy,"" says Jeff Jewett, who owns a store near Yosemite.
And as Memorial Day approaches, the National Parks Service in Washington is preparing for visitors.
""We certainly expect that there will be people who come down to pay their respects on Memorial Day,"" says Mike Litterst, a spokesman with the parks service.
Still, tensions remain between continuing restrictions out of concerns over more cases and restarting the economy. This as the unemployment rate is expected to exceed 20 percent.
""If you don't want to go back to work, don't go back to work, but don't deny the rest of us the ability to go back to work,"" said a protester in Connecticut.
Michigan is one of the hardest hit states and the governor there, Gretchen Whitmer, has issued some of the nation's most restrictive lockdown measures.
She's also been the subject of numerous protests.
Karl Manke is a symbol of that anger. The barber refused to shut down his shop in defiance of the governor's orders and Thursday a judge took his side denying the state's request to shutter his shop.
""I refuse to stand down. License or no license, or whatever it is. I'm 77. I mean, are they going to give me life?"" Manke told a local reporter through a chuckle, enforcing his disdain for the governor's order.
The president expects economic numbers to strengthen over the next few months, but if there is another flare up in cases, it will be governors, not the president, who decide how their states react.

""We don't want them to do mail-in ballots because it is going to lead to total election fraud,"" Trump said. 
The President pushed back after Michigan sent ballot applications - not ballots themselves - to registered voters.
Other states like Nevada are also exploring plans to abandon in-person voting because of health concerns over COVID-19. 
""We don't want anyone to do mail-in ballots but if someone has to mail it in because they are sick or live in the White House and they have to vote in Florida and they won't be in Florida,"" Trump said. ""If there is a reason for it that's ok."" 
While in Michigan, Trump will tour a Ford Plant in Southwest Detroit which converted operations to make ventilators. The President was asked if he plans to wear a mask. 
""I don't know, were going to look at it. A lot of people have asked me that."" Trump said. 
The trip comes amid severe flooding in the Wolverine state. Tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate as Trump has promised to send any help needed. 
""I spoke with the governor yesterday and we have a very good understanding,"" the president said. 
""He did say if he had an opportunity to go to Midland, would you consider joining me? And I said, 'Of course I would,'"" said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. 
All 50 states have now begun to re-open and before leaving the White House the commander-in-chief had this message for people of faith. 
""Another thing Is want to do is get the churches open. Churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of the Democrat governors and we are going to take a strong position on that soon,"" Trump said.

It's part of a Republican-led investigation into the former vice president's youngest son. 
They want to talk with him about his time working with Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, during the Obama administration. 
Democrats say the move is designed to damage Joe Biden's reputation, who is the party's presumptive 2020 nominee. 
The subpoena passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday in an 8-6 party-line vote. 
The chairman of the Republican-led panel, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), has repeatedly insisted that the investigation is not designed to hurt Biden. Another member of the committee, Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said at the vote that ""we need to get to the truth about the Bidens' relationship with Burisma. These hearings will provide the Senate with the full picture.""
Dems Still Trying to Find New Evidence Against Trump
Meanwhile, the US Supreme Court has temporarily prevented congressional Democrats from obtaining secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
The court's unsigned order granted the Trump administration's request to keep previously undisclosed details from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election out of the hands of Democratic lawmakers, at least until early summer.
The court will decide then whether to extend its hold and schedule the case for arguments in the fall. If it does, it's likely the administration will be able to put off the release of any materials until after Election Day.
The House Judiciary Committee told the high court they needed the evidence as part of an ongoing investigation.
The court filing said if the Mueller info reveals new evidence, the committee may consider recommending new articles of impeachment against President Trump.

While some say it's just a way of making voting easier, critics warn it could open the door to some dangerous practices.
   
There's an old saying in politics: 'Never let a crisis go to waste'.  Some critics believe that’s behind the push to transform the way Americans vote.
 
Eric Eggers is the research director for the Government Accountability Institute and author of, 'Fraud: How the Left Plans to Steal the Next Election.'
 
""It's very interesting how the Democrats have been trying to use this global pandemic and unprecedented crisis in our country's history as an opportunity to reshape our election laws,"" he said.
 
California recently joined five other states mandating that their elections be conducted entirely by mail. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed an executive order requiring ballots be sent to all registered Golden State voters prior to the general election. 
 
""There's a lot of concern and anxiety around this November's election in terms of making sure that you can conduct yourself in a safe way and to make sure your health is protected,"" he insisted.
 
In Texas, the Austin City Council passed a resolution urging Gov. Greg Abbott and the secretary of state to implement vote-by-mail to ""protect the voting rights... and public health"" of all Texas voters. 
""Texans who are concerned about their health, about standing in long lines, you need to talk to their legislators,"" said Bruce Elfant, Travis County, Texas Voter Registrar.
  
This week, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans blocked a San Antonio judge's ruling requiring that the state grant 16-million registered Texas voters the option to vote by mail during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Currently, 32 states allow early or absentee mail-in balloting in addition to in-person voting. President Trump says Americans should cast their ballots at a polling place.
 
""I think that mail-in voting is a terrible thing. I think if you vote, you should go - and even the concept of early voting is not the greatest because a lot of things happen,"" the president insisted.   
 
One of those 'things' is potential voter fraud.
 
Eggers said it's fair to assume that many illegal immigrants will receive mail-in ballots, especially in California. And he said ballot harvesting is a main concern. That's where states allow a third party to help the elderly or those shut-in to fill out and mail their ballots.
 
""You wouldn't just hand your wallet and say take this to the bank for me, but the Democrats are now asking people to trust their ballots to these political operatives,"" he explained.
 
Election-related court battles are underway in at least 13 states and election officials are still awaiting word on federal funds to expand the election process. That's money needed as deadlines approach for printing ballots and envelopes.

And fewer states are now requiring voters to show a picture ID before voting. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam recently signed legislation repealing the commonwealth's voter ID law. He said his action makes voting easier and strengthens democracy. Northam and others believe these laws disenfranchise individuals who don't have photo IDs.  
 
""There is no evidence that requiring voter ID has infringed or diminished the productivity of minority voters - in fact, many states including Georgia saw increases in minority voting after implementing voter ID,"" Eggers insisted.            
 
For now, the big push is on to repeal voter ID laws and to vote entirely by mail. Up next? Voting by smartphone. Definitely it would be convenient, but Eggers and others say that method could potentially create more fraud because it would be hard to determine who is actually using the phone to cast the ballot - the owner of the phone, or someone else?

David Brody: ""You've been called a lot of names out there. I mean, they're already saying, 'I will not lie,' and they're calling you a liar already. They're calling you other names, racist and birther and all of that stuff. What's your response to the critics that say all that stuff about you?""
 
Kayleigh McEnany: ""That I know the person I am and I know what I stand for. And I stand as a Christian woman, someone who believes in equality and truth, and loyalty and honesty, and it's the values I've lived by my whole life. It's the values I'll continue to live by and people will malign you, it comes with the job. But I know who I'm ultimately working for.

David Brody: ""Clearly God has impacted your life. And here's Donald Trump as President of the United States and just proving a sense of humor, that Donald Trump is President. Who would have thunk it? And yet, here he is. How do you see God in all of that, this idea of Providence and this idea, I asked Sarah in that seat, a few years back, is Donald Trump put there by God 'for such a time as this?' What's your feeling on that?""
 
Kayleigh McEnany: ""I think, look, prayer made a difference in this election. And that's not to say I think God put, not to say that He puts a certain political party in a certain place at a time but I do believe certain people are meant to be in positions at a certain moment. I do believe that President Trump is the person meant for this moment and I think prayer made a lot of difference in the election. I'll never forget Laura Trump, I asked her, I was interviewing people for my book and I said, 'what made the difference in the election?' And without missing a beat, she said 'prayer'. And I think that's right. I think this country needed someone to fight for life, to fight for religious liberty. And I believe that President Trump was that person and he's done that with the judges he's put in place, with the Mexico City policy ensuring federal dollars don't go to abortions, and mentioning religious liberty in his UN speech was key. There's just so much that he's done to fight for the Christian community. So I certainly believe he's here at this moment for a time, as we all are."" "

She points out it's a drug that's been used safely for many other conditions and says the media is ""fear-mongering"" with their portrayals when it's regularly and safely prescribed by doctors.
David Brody: ""Hydroxychloroquine. What do you know, I said it correctly. Hydroxychloroquine. I know the media is dinging him up on this. You talked a little bit about it earlier on Fox and Friends and some other places. But just so I understand, how comfortable is the President with doing this, and did the doctor specifically prescribe it for him? Just trying to understand correctly.""
 
Kayleigh McEnany: ""Yes, the doctor did prescribe it for him. And he took it after having several discussions with Dr. Conley about its efficacy. And he believed, Dr. Conley, that the benefits outweigh the risks for the President. And, you know, hydroxychloroquine it's worth mentioning is a, a drug that has been approved for at least three other conditions. Malaria is one of them as a prophylaxis. I had someone in my office say, oh, I've taken this drug several times ahead of me going to trips in places where there were Malaria-heavy areas. Lupus is another example. So this is a drug that is out there that has been shown to be safe with these conditions. And, you know, there was issued an emergency use authorization to use this as, essentially like a right-to-try, so if you're someone who has this, who's looking for a therapeutic, who has COVID and is looking for a therapeutic, Hydroxychloroquine is something some doctors professed optimism about. We know it's approved for other uses. So you know, you do have a right to try it, in essence, to reflect on the language of the President's previous legislation that gives people the right to try and the waning days of their life or when they're facing a fatal illness.""
 
David: ""Do you think the media is blowing it out of proportion? You've got Neil Cavuto and Joe Scarborough and China, quite frankly, calling it witchcraft. 'The President is doing witchcraft from the oval office.'""
 
Kayleigh McEnany: ""It's so unfortunate when you turn on the headlines or turn on the TV in the morning, as I did this morning, watching a certain network and to hear just complete misinformation about Hydroxychloroquine, suggesting that it could be fatal for someone should they take it. And when in fact, there are millions of Americans who take it for Arthritis, for example. Yes, it should always be something that's prescribed in the context of a doctor-patient. No one should be taking this drug if not prescribed by a doctor, it's very important to say that. Only your doctor can say that this is for you and prescribe it to you. But nevertheless, to completely act as if this is some sort of poison when there are many, many Americans and many people around the world taking this for Lupus and other illnesses, it just does more harm than good. That kind of fear-mongering, that kind of misinformation. So it's frustrating to turn it on and to see that because it ultimately is very damaging.""
 
David Brody: ""The criticism would be that the FDA, the government, if you will, federal government only recommends that it be taken in a hospital setting. So what's the reaction, the pushback about that criticism?"" 
 
Kayleigh McEnany: ""So I talked to Dr. Hahn about that this morning from the FDA. Dr. Hahn said first, this is a drug that has a long safety profile. It should always be prescribed from a doctor to a patient, but it has been shown to be safe and I explicitly asked him, what about outside of hospitals? And he said, Yes, it's okay. If a doctor prescribes to you at your ordinary point of care, that is an acceptable way to go about this. I think what is being mistaken is the fact that there was a safety notification put out, based on a study that was not a clinical study. It was not a VA study either, but it was based on fatalities in the VA. And basically, it didn't take into account co-morbidities. But it did ask questions about Hydroxychloroquine. And they did put out a safety notice, as the FDA regularly does about studies, but nevertheless, it's still out there. It's still something that FDA stands behind as saying, if you are in a situation where you're prescribed by your doctor is something that you can use and have access to. So, you know, there's a lot of nuances, but those nuances are all too often left out of the coverage."""

Trump Fine After Taking Hydroxychloroquine but Democrats and Media Are Having Fits
EXCLUSIVE: Kayleigh McEnany's Emotional Tribute to Ravi Zacharias
The criticism comes, in part, because the federal government's Food and Drug Administration cautioned against using it and if so, only in a hospital setting.  McEnany wanted to set the record straight. ""I talked to (FDA Commissioner) Dr. Hahn about that,"" she says. ""First, this is a drug that has a long safety profile. It should always be prescribed from a doctor to a patient, but it has been shown to be safe. I explicitly asked him, 'what about outside of hospitals?' and he said, 'yes, it's okay if a doctor prescribes it to you in your ordinary point of care.' That is an acceptable way to go about this.""

CBN's David Brody interviews White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.
 
McEnany says the media is stoking fear without providing necessary details and specifics on this issue. She'd actually like to know why the media isn't asking more questions about what President Trump likes to call, 'Obamagate.' 
""It is a criminal offense to leak the identity of an individual like Michael Flynn, a private citizen, to the press after being unmasked so we know that a crime is committed,"" McEnany tells CBN News. ""Who did it is the question."" 
When asked to clarify if someone in the Obama Administration committed a crime, her response was firm. ""Absolutely, but there are a number of other questions that need to be asked. There's more questions than there are answers in this and the lack of journalistic curiosity is really something intriguing."" 
So does she hold the media accountable for doing the bidding for the Obama Administration on this matter? ""When they don't ask the questions, absolutely. Yes.""
 
The media has already taken aim at McEnany, saying, in their view, she lies from the podium, despite her pledge not to. Her critics have called her a liar, racist and birther. ""I know the person I am, and I know what I stand for and I stand as a Christian woman, someone who believes in equality, in truth, in loyalty and honesty,"" McEnany tells CBN News. ""It's the values I've lived by my whole life. It's the values I'll continue to live by. People will malign you, it comes with the job, but I know who I'm ultimately working for and it's the Big Guy upstairs.""

 
Speaking of 'the Big Guy,' McEnany sees God's hand in the president's election. When asked if God put Donald Trump into The White House for such a time as this, her answer is clear. ""Yeah, I think prayer made a difference in the election,"" she says. ""Not to say that He puts a certain political party in a certain place at a time but I do believe certain people are meant to be in positions at a certain moment and I do believe that President Trump is the person meant for this moment. I think prayer made a lot of difference."" 
McEnany sees the results. ""This country needed someone to fight for life, to fight for religious liberty and I believe that President Trump was that person and he's done that…there's just so much that he's done to fight for the Christian community so I certainly believe that he's here at this moment for a time as we all are.""
 
This White House Press Secretary is surely not shy about her faith. During our interview at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, she became emotional when talking about the recent passing of famed Christian apologist Ravi Zacharias. 
""It's a huge loss,"" she tells CBN News. ""My dad said to me, that Billy Graham was the great evangelist and I think Ravi Zacharias is the great apologist."" As she continued, she paused, trying to collect herself. Her eyes filled up with tears, knowing the impact he made on the development of her Christian faith. ""To have someone from an academic place, as an apologist, could equip you with those arguments where you didn't have to check your brain at the door when you became a Christian, where there is intellectual foundation for everything we believe… but his life continues in the next life. He is someone I'll meet in heaven and rest assured his legacy will always be here and he will continue to change lives.""
 
This press secretary is hoping to make a difference here on earth too.

A FULL TRANSCRIPT of her answer on Ravi Zacharias is BELOW.
MANDATORY COURTESY: CBN NEWS
David Brody: ""Can I ask you a personal question about Ravi Zacharias, passing away just in the last 24 hours or so. I know his teachings were so important to you, especially at Oxford, you mentioned this. Can you tell me a little bit about what he meant to you personally and the loss for the Christian community?""
 
Kayleigh McEnany: ""Yeah, it's a huge loss. You know, my dad said to me, that Billy Graham was the great evangelist. And I think Ravi Zacharias is the great apologist..."" (she pauses with tears in her eyes).
 
David Brody: ""I know this is tough.""
 
Kayleigh McEnany: ""We don't have to cry because we're Christians. So we know he's…""
 
David Brody: ""Yes, we are human the last time I checked. But the tears come from what? What was it because it feels like Oxford and the development of your faith.""
 
Kayleigh McEnany: ""Yes. Ravi is someone that I never met. I know his team, and I know some of those who are around him. But, you know, for me as a Christian, I always had the heart for Jesus Christ that I got a very young age. I was saved when I was in my teens, but to have someone from an academic place, as an apologist could equip you with those arguments where you didn't have to check your brain at the door when you became a Christian where there is intellectual foundation for everything we believe; there's prophecy, there's the human cell, there's the amazing creation of the human body and all of its complexity and the planet, the universe and he put a philosophical and academic rationale for the heart that I had for Christ but gave me the ability to go to Oxford, where there are renowned atheist scholars who try to say there's no intellectual undergirding for Christianity. Ravi Zacharias, who happened to have an office at Oxford was the person who provided the counter to that, the intelligence behind why we believe what we believe. And you know, your mind can never get you fully there. It's a place only your heart can take you. But Ravi Zacharias provided those steps to put in the minds of an academic, 'wow, I should give the Christian faith some thought.' Ravi means so much, As I was saying earlier, Billy Graham was the great evangelist. Ravi Zacharias is the great apologist. And, I think the words that were at the very bottom of the announcement today of his passing are so important. He had a verse there and it said, 'because I live, you also will live, John 14:19. ' And they said that these seven words changed Ravi's life, 57 years ago. He was on a bed of suicide as he described it, and it was a Bible that was handed to him and those words in particular, that set him on a 57-year path that has truly saved lives.""
""On Sunday I watched a sermon knowing Ravi was in a tough spot and was no longer getting treatment. So I had my daughter on my lap and we were watching the sermon of Ravi and my husband was there. My mother in law was there. And it was a sermon about purpose. And it was a sermon about how every human life has a purpose. You are here for a reason. Every life matters. And it's about finding that purpose. Just hearing him speak and hearing those words was so meaningful. And it was in that sermon, I believe, where he shared the story of a CNN sportscaster who was living a profligate lifestyle and making bad decisions in life but changed his life and found his purpose and found a family and became a Christian and got very sick. And when he was on his deathbed, the CNN sportscaster said that he was just really in search of God and really in search of finding Christ and hearing from Christ as he was about to leave behind his little daughter and he saw a figure that is how he always imagined Jesus Christ would look like. And who he had pictured was Jesus sat on the corner of his bed and said, tonight's not the night you will pass. And he had this distinct moment before he passed. And I'm watching Ravi describe that moment, knowing that he was probably in the next few days coming to his last moment. It changed me once again to hear that and to post the sermon on Twitter and have a user say, 'Wow, I've never given Christianity a thought but having watched what Ravi had to say, I may have to give Christianity a thought.'

The court filing said if the Mueller info reveals new evidence, the House Judiciary Committee may consider recommending new articles of impeachment against President Trump.  
The filing comes after a federal appeals court said that the committee had a ""compelling need"" to view the secret witness testimony. 
The Justice Department has asked the high court to block the release of the documents saying it would suffer ""irreparable harm"" if it had to turn over the grand-jury records before the justices had decided whether to take up the appeal.

Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr says he does not expect criminal probes of either former President Barack Obama or Vice President Joe Biden in the Justice Department's investigation of the FBI's conduct in the Russia probe.
Barr, speaking Monday at an unrelated news conference and responding to a question about Trump's allegations, repeated his belief that ""what happened to the president"" as a result of the FBI's investigation into whether his 2016 campaign conspired with Russia was ""abhorrent"" and a ""grave injustice."" He has appointed John Durham, the US Attorney for Connecticut, to investigate whether crimes were committed as intelligence and law enforcement officials examined Russian election interference.
President Trump says the Obama administration orchestrated the probe at the highest levels. Barr says there's no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.
""As long as I'm Attorney General, the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends,"" he said. 
""We live in a very divided country right now, and I think that it is critical that we have an election where the American people are allowed to make a decision, a choice, between President Trump and Vice President Biden based on a robust debate of policy issues,"" Barr said. ""And we cannot allow this process to be hijacked by efforts to drum up criminal investigations of either candidate.""
Barr's comments come as Democrats and some former law enforcement officials have accused the attorney general of politicizing decisions and doing Trump's bidding at the Justice Department."

President Trump has already promised to veto it as Republicans say it's way off track.
The measure comes as a new report reveals a record collapse in retail sales, with purchases tumbling 16.4 percent between March and April. According to the Commerce Department, retail sales over the past 12 months are down 21.6 percent with restaurants, clothing companies, and electronics and furniture stores hit the hardest. 
The previous coronavirus economic aid bills passed in Congress with bipartisan support, but not this one. It's more expensive than all four of the prior coronavirus bills combined.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has blasted it as ""a $3 trillion dollar left-wing wish list,"" highlighting measures like government cash for illegal immigrants.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) agreed, saying the bill is more about instituting liberal policies than helping coronavirus victims, pointing out that it ""adds funding for Planned Parenthood.""
""This is the most liberal wishlist that has nothing to do with COVID-19,"" he continued. Other controversial measures in the bill include mandating vote-by-mail and granting banking rights to the marijuana industry.
Dr. James Dobson is highly critical of both the price tag and the agenda he sees in the so-called coronavirus relief bill. ""Make no mistake, $3 trillion is a breathtaking amount of money. It is appalling the Democrats are willing to mortgage the future of our children and grandchildren, all to ram through a socialist agenda that runs counter to the wishes of most Americans, not to mention the Constitution of the United States!"" 
Still, McConnell told Fox News there's a ""high likelihood"" Congress will do another coronavirus aid bill which would include Republican proposals.
And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said the Democrats will be in talks with Republicans. ""We'll pass it the House and then we'll negotiate, as we go forward,"" she said.
The Democratic bill is the largest such measure in history, with some estimates placing it around $3.5 trillion in deficit spending. Debt hawks are warning that America is getting closer and closer to a point of no return as the US national debt has already soared to $25 trillion.
On a side note, House Democrats also voted to let members vote by proxy for future bills, to avoid returning to DC during the pandemic."

As many states start easing lockdown restrictions, Bright cautioned that the window of opportunity to successfully fight the coronavirus is closing, and issued this stark warning.
""Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history,"" he warned.  
Bright called for a national testing strategy and testified that leadership ignored his early warnings about the crisis.
""I began pushing urgently in January along with some industry colleagues as well and those alarms were not responded to with action,"" he claimed. 
One month ago, Bright was removed from his position as the director of BARDA, the federal agency working to find a vaccine. He claims his removal came after complaining no action was taken to stock up on treatments like Remdesavir while he raised alarms on promoting other untested drugs like hydroxychloroquine.
""My concerns about the safety of hydroxychloroquine in people infected with the COVID-19 virus were reflective of the review we received from inner agency group of clinicians and regulatory experts,"" he testified. 
President Trump fired back at Bright's claims on Thursday.
""We've had tremendous response to the hydroxyl,"" said Trump. ""To me, he is nothing more than a really unhappy, disgruntled person.""
Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) argued that while the drug may be untested, with no known cure available, for people facing death – the side effects pale in comparison.
""If you're worried about not having a heartbeat at all, you're not concerned about it being irregular if you're worried about not having a heartbeat at all,"" Griffith said. 
""We need to be careful, sir,"" Bright responded. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also rebutted Bright's claims that the administration was slow to respond, and told reporters his accusations do not hold water.
""Everything he is complaining about was achieved. Everything he talks about was done,"" argued Azar. ""Oh and by the way, whose job was it to actually lead the development of vaccine? Dr. Bright. So while we're launching Operation Warp Speed, he's not showing up to work to be part of that.""
While Bright believes it's unlikely a vaccine will be available in the next twelve to eighteen months, President Trump said Thursday he expects one by the end of this year."

Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) introduced a bill on Wednesday aimed at allowing larger nonprofits and faith-based groups access to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Under the current law, only businesses with less than 500 employees qualify. The new bill would eliminate the 500-employee cap for nonprofits and faith-based organizations. 
""Churches, YMCAs, and other organizations are doing amazing work during this difficult time to provide childcare, meals, and other support for families and children,"" said Loeffler in a statement. ""This legislation will allow them to access loans to help them keep their doors open and continue serving their communities while ensuring no taxpayer dollars go to abortion providers.""   
The Limiting Infant Fatality and Empowering Nonprofit Organization Workforces Act, or LIFE NOW, would also prohibit taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. 
""Paycheck Protection Program funds are for saving jobs and helping people, not ending lives,"" said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), one of the bill's cosponsors. ""Our legislation prohibits taxpayer-funded bailouts for abortion providers and allows larger nonprofits seeking to better their communities to access the assistance they need.""
Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Mike Rounds (R-SD) are also sponsoring the legislation.
""Subjecting not-for-profit organizations to affiliation rules has left out large nonprofits like the YMCA and numerous churches and faith-based organizations that serve our communities with food, shelter, and other important assistance before, during, and after this pandemic,"" Lankford explained. ""We need them to be able to keep their doors open now more than ever.""

Justice Dept Exonerates Michael Flynn: 'He Was Targeted by the Obama Administration'
Charges were brought against Flynn back in 2017 by former special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into Russia election meddling. 
Flynn admitted lying twice to the FBI about his dealings with Russia and faces up to 5 years in prison on the felony charge. 
President Barack Obama, who forced Flynn's removal from his own administration, had warned then-President-Elect Trump about bringing him back to the White House.

Former Vice President Joe Biden says President Trump is diverting attention away from the pandemic and needs to focus on the economic and health crisis. 
""I know nothing about these moves to investigate Michael Flynn, number one,"" Biden said. ""Number two, this is all about diversion. This is a game this guy plays all the time.""
Attorney General William Barr insists it was ""his duty"" to drop charges against Flynn. This week nearly 2,000 former Justice Department employees disagreed and in a letter called on Barr to step down as attorney general claiming he ""assaulted the rule of law."" 
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell sent several Republican senators a list of former senior Obama administration officials who might have been involved in efforts to ""unmask"" Flynn during the presidential transition period, according to media reports. 
The list features top figures including then-Vice President Joe Biden, then-FBI Director James Comey and intelligence chiefs John Brennan and James Clapper. It also included Obama's then-chief of staff Denis McDonough. 
""While the principals are identified below, we cannot confirm they saw the unmasked information,"" the document read. "

And the races took place in areas that are worth watching for possible impact in the big 2020 elections in November.
In California, Republicans have ended their 22-year political drought with a win for a US House seat that was held by a Democrat. Trump had lost that district in the 2016 election, but now the candidate he supported in this special House race has won it.
“Remember, get out and vote for Mike Garcia,” Trump had tweeted Tuesday. “A really big deal for our country!”
GOP candidate Mike Garcia, a former Navy combat pilot, earned a double-digit lead for the seat, just north of Los Angeles, edging out Democratic Assemblywoman Christy Smith. The seat in the 25th District had been held by Democrat Rep. Katie Hill who resigned after facing a House ethics probe over one affair and rumors of another affair with a staffer.
While Trump had backed Garcia for the race, former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had backed Smith. 
Final tallies aren't available yet as vote counting is delayed by coronavirus issues, like mail-in ballots, but Smith has now conceded the race. More than 143,000 ballots had already been counted, and most of them were of the mail-in variety.
Trump-Supported Candidate Wins in Wisconsin
 
Meanwhile, another Trump-backed candidate has won a special election in a Wisconsin congressional race. GOP state senator Tom Tiffany won overwhelmingly in a conservative district.
  
Tiffany defeated Democrat Tricia Zunker in the state's 7th District. Tiffany will take the seat that had been held by Rep. Sean Duffy who retired in September as his wife was giving birth to the couple's ninth child, a little girl with Down syndrome. 
This race is worth watching because Wisconsin will be a big battleground state for the 2020 race. Trump won the state by less than one point in 2016, and he'll need strong support in that 7th District in order to win again. 
  
“Tonight was a win for President Trump and Tom Tiffany that demonstrates the enthusiasm behind our president across Wisconsin,"" said Trump campaign spokeswoman Anna Kelly.

""We must think big for the people now because if we don't, it will cost more in lives and livelihood later. Not acting is the most expensive course,"" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said during a press conference Tuesday.
The bill includes financial aid for state and local governments, assistance for mortgage and rent and more cash payments to Americans. 
Republicans aren't convinced, saying more government spending isn't the answer since Congress has already borrowed trillions of dollars for relief spending. That means trillions of dollars have been added to the US national debt as a result.
""Look, we can't spend enough money to prop this economy up forever. People need to be able to begin to be productive again,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. 
Republicans had no input on the bill and call it a ""liberal wish list"" and a grab bag of Democrats' ""pet priorities,"" referring to measures like expanding voting by mail and funding for government arts and humanities programs. 
""In terms of the House Phase Four Bill, it's got so much unrelated to coronavirus, it is dead on arrival here in terms of a viable idea,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). 
BELOW Sen. Braun to CBN News: Democrats' New Stimulus Package 'A Non-Starter'
Critics say Pelosi's $3 trillion bill is more about pro-choice politics than it is about fighting COVID-19.
March for Life Action President Tom McClusky reveals, ""Her proposal includes the removal of safeguards in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) that prevent taxpayer money from bailing out the billion-dollar abortion-giant Planned Parenthood – an organization which has dedicated $45 million this cycle to electing pro-abortion politicians, like Pelosi."" 
""The bill would also allow federal tax dollars to pay for abortions through subsidized health care plans. And, at the state and local level, it authorizes over $900 billion in open-ended funding – so nothing would prevent this money from further subsidizing the abortion industry. This bill would be disaster for the unborn,"" McClusky contends.  
This is the fifth coronavirus aid package to come to Congress, and the costs from the previous bills are starting to show up. The federal deficit for the month of April alone was a staggering $738 billion.

The package includes funds to help the hard-hit economy as well as state and local governments. The aid will provide $25 billion for the US Postal Service and $75 billion more for virus testing.
And the relief measure also could mean more money for individual Americans.
Under the act, Individuals could receive $1,200 and up to $6,000 per household.  $175 billion is also included for a housing assistance fund to help pay rents and mortgages.
Hospitals and other health care providers could receive $100 billion along with further assistance for hospitals serving low-income communities.
The package will provide $600 million in funding to fight the spread of COVID-19 in state and federal prisons and $600 million to assist law enforcement agencies with finances and facilities.

Rosenstein's first directive to Mueller in a May 2017 memo instructed Mueller to investigate links between the Russian government and people associated with the Trump campaign.
But in August, Rosenstein broadened the scope and issued a second memo authorizing Mueller to investigate certain people in relation to possible crimes apart from the Russia probe, including campaign manager Paul Manafort, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, businessman Carter Page, and low-level policy aide George Papadopoulos.

Justice Dept Exonerates Michael Flynn: 'He Was Targeted by the Obama Administration'
Republicans claim Mueller's probe was an investigation in search of a crime, and with the original claims of Russian collusion largely based on Russian disinformation found in the debunked Steele dossier that was paid for by the Clinton campaign. 
Russian collusion allegations against Trump have unraveled with each investigation, now made clear as more documents are released. 
   
After more than two years and millions of dollars, the Mueller Report released last year showed no collusion with the Russians by the Trump campaign. The investigation landed Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort in prison, but for crimes that happened before he ever became part of the Trump campaign.  
Other previously sealed documents released by the Department of Justice raise questions about a possible set-up of General Flynn by FBI agents, with handwritten notes by the then-counterintelligence director Bill Priestap openly questioning if the bureau's ""goal"" was to ""get him to lie"".  
This and other document revelations prompted Flynn's attorney, Sidney Powell, to ask the court to reverse Flynn's guilty plea of lying to the FBI and to throw out the case against him claiming investigational misconduct. And just this afternoon, in a stunning reversal, the Justice Department announced it is dropping the case against Flynn. Read about that HERE.
Carter Page was never charged with anything.
 According to The Federalist, the DOJ Office of Inspector General found that Rosenstein's DOJ fabricated evidence and falsified documents to obtain a warrant to spy on Page.  An FBI lawyer is alleged to have altered documents to hide the fact that – rather than working for a foreign government on his many trips to Russia – that Page actually for years worked on behalf of the US government to help investigate Russian agents.

The Justice Department is dropping the tainted criminal case against retired Army General Michael Flynn – President Trump's first national security adviser.

Documents Reveal Mueller Probe Went Well Beyond Original Mission to Find Russian Collusion
One of the newly released FBI documents from the investigation includes a handwritten note considering the purpose of interviewing Flynn.
A senior FBI official wrote, ""What's our goal? Truth/admission or get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired?""
Critics call that entrapment and say the FBI grossly abused its power.
Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump called efforts to go after Flynn ""treason.""
""He was targeted by the Obama administration and he was targeted in order to try and take down a president and what they've done is a disgrace and I hope a big price is gonna be paid,"" he said.
Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others, accuse Attorney General Bill Barr of doing the president's bidding. Barr says it's all about finding the truth.
""I'm prepared for that. I also think it's sad these partisan feelings are so strong that people have lost any sense of justice,"" Barr said in an interview.
In a column, liberal law professor Jonathan Turley says it's clear that the investigators were in the wrong. He writes, ""I have certainly seen abuses in my career as a criminal defense attorney, but I have never seen a record as troubling as this one in prosecutors seeking the creation rather than the investigation of criminal conduct.""
READ: Documents Reveal Mueller Probe Went Well Beyond Original Mission to Find Russian Collusion
In the end, the AP reports that the following conclusions were reached by the Department of Justice:
Flynn’s interview by the FBI was “untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn”
The interview was “conducted without any legitimate investigative basis.”
President Trump says Flynn has now been exonerated.  ""General Flynn was under an enormous pressure and it was an artificial pressure because what they did to General Flynn was a disgrace, it was a total disgrace, it's shocking,"" Trump said. ""What they tried to do to destroy him and to hurt this presidency was — there has never been anything like it. An absolute disgrace.""

""Texas is fully capable of being able to handle the healthcare needs of everyone that contracts COVID-19,"" said Abbott. 
Illinois is taking a more conservative approach, opening the state region by region.

But the invisible enemy's days could be numbered as pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and BioNTech launched human trials in the effort to create a new vaccine.

Why Sen. Jim DeMint Says It's Time to Reopen","In a recent op-ed column in USA Today, former South Carolina Republican Senator Jim DeMint calls for caution but says America needs to reopen the economy immediately.
DeMint, the current chairman of the Conservative Partnership Institute, wrote: ""The elite left and media mob — who are still getting paid to work from home — are outraged. But their hysteria has nothing to do with public health. It's about politics, power, and the 2020 election.""
During an interview on CBN News's ""Faith Nation"" program on Tuesday, DeMint said he does not mean that every state and every business needs to open right now. 
""I think we've got some really smart governors. South Carolina is doing it well. Certainly, Governor DeSantis in Florida is going county by county looking at infection rates,"" the former senator said. ""But let's go back to the beginning of this lockdown and remember that they weren't trying to keep us from getting this virus, they were trying to slow the infection rate so it wouldn't overwhelm our hospitals and healthcare system.""
""So we've got governors in most of the states around the country who can move back to regular life in a cautious way and just keep an eye on the infection rate,"" DeMint explained. ""If the infection rate comes back, we need to make sure we have the healthcare facilities and experts to take care of us. But this idea that we hear from some blue state governors that we got to keep our economy closed down, I'm afraid that had nothing to do with healthcare. It has everything to do with politics and the 2020 elections."" 
DeMint noted the American economy is on the verge of collapse and if another wave of the coronavirus comes back in the fall, we can't shut everything down again. 
""The Federal Reserve now is printing money. And with the Congress spending and borrowing more money than we ever have in history, and we have a higher unemployment rate than we've had in decades, so we've got to get back to work,"" he said. ""We've got to do it cautiously. But this idea of keeping the economy shutdown is only so that the economy will be back in November. The thing that worries me the most, is how many people in the political realm are taking advantage of this in ways that have nothing to do with healthcare.""
New data from Stanford University reveals since Georgia has reopened sections of its economy, the risk of exposure has risen about 40 percent. CBN News asked DeMint if he was concerned about a rise in coronavirus cases as the US economy reopens.
""Notice they say the risk of exposure. We don't have data that suggests that more people are being infected or getting sick,"" The former senator responded. ""We're learning more about this virus. Most people who get it, don't even know they have it or have very mild symptoms. It's only a very narrow section of the population that's at risk. It's folks who are generally older with pre-existing conditions of some kind that are complicated by the coronavirus.""
""So working-age people, who are healthy have almost no risk from this,"" he continued. ""So I think what we need now more than anything else is just good data on who is at risk, what are the real symptoms of folks who get it but are not hospitalized. I think what we can do is reduce the fear significantly that most people can go out and go back to their lives at very little risk. But some people who have health conditions and are older, need to be very careful. And so we can do that without keeping things locked down. Because I don't see any evidence that the lockdown is producing better health results."""

It's the type of spending the US hasn't seen since WWII and that spending occurred over the course of five years.
""So to the extent that lawmakers have been talking about this being a war-like effort, on the spending and deficit side, it certainly looks that way,"" Romina Boccia with The Heritage Foundation tells CBN News.

Sen. Rand Paul Warns US Debt Nearing 'Point of No Return', Backs Calls to Reopen Economy 
With Some States Re-Opening, Lawmakers Discuss Infrastructure Package to Help Reboot Economy
Boccia and other economic experts don't fault Congress or the Fed for their actions. 
""If you look at the next two, three years our economy is gonna be awfully weak and you really do need the government spending to keep the economy from weakening even further,"" says Desmond Lachman with the American Enterprise Institute.
The federal government is now more than $24 trillion in debt, and this year the national deficit has already quadrupled to nearly $4 trillion with another massive relief package expected from Congress.
""The deficit for this year at $3.7 trillion will exceed all of the tax revenues the government can hope to collect by roughly $700 billion,"" Boccia explains.

So what impact will this massive new debt have long term for areas like defense, healthcare, and entitlement programs? Boccia believes cutting defense spending would be the wrong move.
""Lawmakers should target the key programs driving the growth in US spending, but that will be also problematic because one of the biggest ones is Medicare, and also Medicaid spending, and I think we will see the American people asking for more investments in health coming out of this public health crisis,"" says Boccia.
In the not-so-distant future, lawmakers will likely feel pressure to raise taxes to offset the spending which could prolong an economic recession.
Also, if individuals have taken on more personal debt to make it through the crisis, that will also affect the recovery.
""Maybe they're behind on their mortgage and student loan payments and making up for that could mean reduced consumption on the other side,"" Boccia says.
Look for some people to also lose their vehicles because of higher interest and longer terms on car loans. 
There's also the likelihood unemployment will be higher. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will be 10 percent by the end of 2021.
""We're bound to see a whole wave of bankruptcies and financial strain that will be the fallout, that will be the next phase of this crisis,"" explains Lachman.
And America will likely have to contend with more than its own financial woes.
Lachman expects a spillover from the global pandemic economic crisis will also affect the US economy.
""We haven't seen this before that so many countries have been hit at the same time by a shock as large as this coronavirus shock,"" he says.
So instead of more stimulus going forward, some experts say the best focus for lawmakers is the health care crisis so Americans can get back to work while allowing the private sector to drive the economy.

It comes at a historic time as fear of the coronavirus has the nine justices of the high court separated and hearing arguments over the phone.
The nuns, known as the Little Sisters of the Poor, want to do nothing more than continue their order's 181-year mission of service.
""They are an order of Catholic nuns who serve the elderly poor and dying - truly the most vulnerable among us, especially in the midst of this pandemic,"" said senior counsel Diana Verm from the Becket religious rights legal group that's helping to defend them.
Would Force Nuns to Fund Abortion
Their legal trouble began when they defied the Obamacare contraception mandate. That mandate would have forced these pro-life Little Sisters of the Poor to violate their conscience by making them cover abortion-causing contraceptives in their healthcare plan.  
The group won at the US Supreme Court in 2016 and received a religious exemption. Now states like Pennsylvania, unhappy with that outcome, are bringing the case back to the high court again.
Verm told CBN News these states are ""telling the federal government that they have to force nuns to provide contraceptives.""
She added, ""The states are arguing that the government doesn't have the authority to issue religious exemptions.   And that really threatens our nation's rich history of protecting religious minorities by protecting their religious beliefs.""
Nuns Could Face Crippling Fines
If the Little Sisters lose, they could face fines of 60 to 70 million dollars a year.
""Those are annual fines,"" explained Verm.  ""It's a hundred dollars per employee per day.""
Thanks to social distancing, this will be the first religious liberty case the Supreme Court hears by telephone conferencing.  This brand-new practice, which is also letting the whole world listen in LIVE, began Monday, May 4.
Those listening live Monday heard the session kick off with the familiar words of Supreme Court Marshal Pamela Talkin, intoning, ""Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business before the honorable Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to give their attention, for the Court is now sitting. God save the United States and this honorable court.""
The justices are usually handing out their biggest rulings during May, and June at the latest, as they wrap up the current term before the 4th of July holiday.   But with the pandemic already forcing the Court to hold some of its hearings later than usual, it may also mean they don't announce their ruling on this Little Sisters case, and others, till July… maybe even August.

Reade tells the Wall Street Journal she will eventually sit for a television interview but right now she’s “digesting and processing everything he said.”  
Meanwhile, Biden appears to be moving on after personally addressing the allegations on MSNBC Friday.
“It is not true. I'm saying unequivocally it never, never happened. And it didn't. It never happened,” claims Biden. “Look, from the very beginning, I've said believing women means taking the woman's claims seriously when she steps forward in and then vet it, look into it…that's true in this case as well. Women have a right to be heard and the press should rigorously investigate claims they make. I'll always uphold that principle. But in the end, in every case, the truth is what matters. In this case, the truth is the claims are false.”
A potentially key piece to the puzzle is a nearly 30-year-old claim Reade says she filed with a Senate personnel office about the incident. Reade, now 56 years old, does not have a copy of the complaint and can’t remember whether she used the words “sexual harassment” when detailing what happened to her.
Biden maintains he’s never had any knowledge of such a complaint.
""I'm absolutely positive that no one that I'm aware of ever has been made aware of any complaint, a formal complaint made by, or a complaint, by Tara Reade against me at the time this allegedly happened 27 years ago,” argues Biden.
On Friday Biden directed the National Archives to search Senate records in its possession for any record of this complaint and make it available, but the Secretary of the Senate responded that if such a document exists, legally, they couldn’t release it.
Many powerful female Democrats are standing with Biden despite the allegations. They include Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a possible running mate for Biden.
“As a survivor, and as a feminist, I'll say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. Then we have a duty to vet it,” Whitmer told CNN. 
”I have read a lot about this current allegation…I don't believe that it's consistent with the Joe Biden that I know, and I do believe Joe, and I support Joe Biden.”
Even  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is standing by his former senate colleague for now.
“The Joe Biden I know, I've never seen anything or believed that he would do anything like this until you convince me otherwise,” Graham told Fox News.
President Donald Trump, who’s no stranger to sexual harassment accusations, also offered this unsolicited advice to Biden on The Dan Bongino Show.
“It’s his problem, but I like to get in front of it and deny it. If it’s not true you deny it and I’ve been a total victim of this nonsense, false accusations,” said Trump.
Many Republicans, however, are outraged by what they call a double standard in how Democrats and the media are treating Biden’s accusations compared to those brought against Justice Brett Kavanaugh – and cite the need for due process for everyone. 
“The hypocrisy has been appalling, and we need to do some self-reflection as to how Kavanaugh was treated versus how Biden is being treated right now,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told ABC This Week."

Mike Huckabee
 
My Faith Votes recently had the chance to interview our Honorary National Chairman and former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, to discuss the novel coronavirus's economic and political implications, the upcoming 2020 elections and the importance of bringing faith to the voting booth.
 
This conversation has been edited for clarity and length:
 
My Faith Votes: People have a lot of things on their minds, but of course right now the thing that's most on their mind is COVID-19 and the response of our nation and our government to this pandemic. One viewer asked: Was the shutdown of our economy really necessary, and can the economy come back?
 
Gov. Huckabee: I think that the people making the decisions saw information that most of us are not going to have access to see, and I have confidence in the President. I have confidence in the people around him at the highest levels. There's no way they would have done the things they did to shut down virtually the entire economy had they not been genuinely alarmed … If there was not confidence … that this was a serious public health risk and that this could become a pandemic that could potentially kill millions, I don't think the actions would have been taken.
 
Can the economy come back? Yes, but it won't come back quickly. The biggest problem that we're facing is that a lot of small businesses will not be able to recover … their customer base has been shattered, their employees have scattered, the communities aren't going to be the same.
 
So I think we're looking at a long, long recovery. If there's one bit of good news, it's that the economy was on fire before this started. So we started from a place of strength rather than weakness, and that is the saving grace if there is one economically.
 
MFV: As a former governor, what are the factors those in state leadership should consider during states of emergency like the one we are living in?
 
Gov. Huckabee: You always want to position assets and resources so that if the worst happens you're prepared for it. One of the reasons the shutdown happened was … that we don't have a hospital healthcare system that is big enough to handle the potential cases that we saw coming. So it was a matter of overwhelming the health care system to a level that you would have people unnecessarily dying, so the steps that were taken to mitigate this were done so we didn't overwhelm that healthcare system. Quite frankly, that's been a good decision.
 
Many governors...are saying, ""Let's get things ramped back up, let's open up the economy.""... Every state is different, and that's why the President has pushed these decisions back down to the state level. That's where they belong! The Tenth Amendment says that, and I still believe in the Constitution. But I will say this, that I think states need to start looking at how quickly can they get people back to work, even if it's modified a little bit, and back to some routine, because nothing is worse than getting in a long-term lockdown to the point that we all end up with sort of what I call a public health version of the Stockholm Syndrome, where people start getting comfortable, used to the idea of lockdown and they're afraid to leave.
 
We've got to get people moving back out doing their routine, going to church, for example. And we can't have people saying that you can go to a drive-in liquor store but you can't do a drive-in church service, which we've seen in Kentucky, Mississippi, and in Florida.
 
MFV: How should churches and individuals think about the balance of religious freedom and government control during these times?
 
Gov. Huckabee:  We should very much be concerned, and here's my fear: it's one thing for us to have a period of weeks in which churches voluntarily do their services online or in the parking lot of the drive-in, but we don't want a government that can say to a church, ""We are suspending the First Amendment."" The very first right in the First Amendment is freedom of religion, followed by freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. To say that those have been suspended by the government, they better have a reason that's overwhelming.
 
There have been some heavy-handed things in Tampa, Hillsborough County. The sheriff told the pastor of the church there that they could go ahead with their Sunday services as long as they practice social distancing and took precautions, which the church did — (invested) hundred thousand dollars in an air filtration system, put gloves on everyone, gave them all disinfectant. On Monday after they had the church service they were told they could have, the pastor was actually arrested and arraigned for it. This is a frightening thing, when the mayors of places like Greenville, Mississippi, and Louisville, Kentucky started sending police officers to give tickets to people in their cars for $500 for attending a drive-in service.
 
This is the first wave of when government says, ""Hey, these people went along pretty willingly. The next time we have an issue and we want to make the church conform to something that's politically correct, we'll just tell them they can't meet."" And we don't ever get used to this idea that the government can tell us when we can gather, what we can say and how we can get around it.
 
MFV: So what do we do about it? Does it help to contact your elected officials?
 
Gov. Huckabee: Well, they do, especially when they know that you're representing millions of potential voters. One of the reasons that I'm involved in My Faith Votes … is because in America alone there's between 60 and 80 million professing evangelical Christians.
 
I think we contact our officials, but we also use our rights (as)  citizens. Churches are fighting back. The church in Tampa, for example, enlisted the assistance of Liberty Counsel. Others are using Alliance Defending Freedom or Pacific Justice Institute, First Liberty Institute in Texas. All of these organizations are helping people defend themselves and actively fight for their rights, and we should not be critical of that. We should be grateful that these folks are standing up and really fighting for all of our basic fundamental constitutional rights.
MFV: What would you say to people who are concerned about how they will vote in November?
 
Gov. Huckabee:  You should be. You should vote, however, use your faith and your values. Don't vote for somebody because you think that he would be the ideal person to sit beside you in church. Ask, ""Will the decisions this individual makes empower me as a liberty-minded American, or will it maybe take some of my basic fundamental liberties away?"" and ""Will the people that he or she appoints, will they represent the things that are a great value and importance to me, or will they make decisions that fundamentally harm my ability to teach my children what I want to about biblical marriage, about gender identity?""
 
MFV: We've gotten a number of questions about what will happen when election season comes around, especially concerns around voter fraud. Are you concerned about that?
 
Gov. Huckabee:  I'm concerned about voter fraud when there isn't a COVID-19 going on. ...Voter fraud is real. I know people downplay it and say it doesn't really happen, but it does. Does it swing a lot of elections? Maybe not, but if it swings one, it's one too many.
 
What I think we need to be worried about in the wake of COVID-19 and the government shutdown and social distancing and all the things that may keep people away from traditional voting methods is the idea of (voting) by mail without any accountability. How do we know that a person voted with integrity if they vote by way of the internet? Do they get a personalized code that once it's used it can't be used by anyone else? There are some things that could be done to make it safer, but as citizens, not just as Christians but as citizens, we need to demand transparency in the voting process. And we need to demand accountability for the manner in which the votes are registered, tabulated and accounted for.
 
MFV: One viewer asked: What Bible verse sticks out to you to focus on and read in preparation for the coming elections?
 
Gov. Huckabee: The one verse that has been my life verse since I was 15 was Philippians 4:13, ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" And that means I can vote sensibly, I can serve as a citizen … everyone can have some involvement. But it's not about how smart you are, it's not about how tough or how important (or) well-informed you are. It's ""I can do all things,"" and the key here is ""through Christ who strengthens me."" Let us never forget that our strength does not come from our education or our affiliations with people or groups. It comes from our walk with God, and that's why (you should) vote your faith. Don't just vote your feelings, don't just vote your friends' feelings, vote your faith.
 
Pray, seriously pray. I believe that God answers our prayers ... if we say, ""God, give me wisdom as to who to vote for."" If I didn't believe God would answer that prayer I wouldn't even suggest that we pray at all, but of course he will.

In her first briefing as White House Press Secretary on Friday, Kayleigh McEnany was asked about whether Flynn was guilty. She turned the tables on reporters saying, ""Do you not consider it a miscarriage of justice"" that the FBI actually plotted against General Flynn, to try to trap him?
Trump says he believes Flynn should now be cleared in court, but if that doesn't happen, he as president has ""a different type of power.""
""It looks to me like Michael Flynn would be exonerated based on everything I see,"" Trump told reporters Thursday. ""I'm not the judge, but I have a different type of power. But I don't know that anybody would have to use that power. I think he's exonerated.""
""General Flynn was under an enormous pressure and it was an artificial pressure because what they did to General Flynn was a disgrace, it was a total disgrace, it's shocking,"" Trump said. ""What they tried to do to destroy him and to hurt this presidency was — there has never been anything like it. An absolute disgrace.""
A reporter then asked Trump, ""Are you going to pardon him, and if so are you considering bringing him back into your administration?""
""Well, it looks like Michael Flynn would be exonerated based on everything I see,"" Trump responded. ""I'm not the judge, but I have a different type of power but I don't know that anybody would have to use that power - I think he's exonerated. I've never seen anything like it.""
""I think he's a fine man, I think it's terrible what they did to him,"" Trump continued. ""I would certainly consider it, yeah, I would. I think he is a fine man. I think he has got a great family.""
Trump has long said he is considering pardoning Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. 
Fox News reported internal FBI documents that were unsealed Thursday indicated that Peter Strzok – the fired chief of the FBI's Counterespionage Section whose text messages revealed him plotting against President Trump – had also ordered the investigation of Flynn to remain open even after it was scheduled to be closed due to a lack of so-called ""derogatory"" information.
Flynn's lawyers have released internal correspondence they obtained through a Justice Department review of the handling of the case. They argue the documents support their allegations that Flynn was set up to lie when he was questioned at the White House on January 24, 2017, about conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in which the men discussed sanctions recently imposed on Russia over election interference.
Flynn later pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI agents but did not contest the way he was interviewed during his sentencing hearing a year later. His legal team has since sought to get his guilty plea withdrawn citing ""egregious"" FBI misconduct.
Flynn is still waiting to be sentenced. Judge Emmet Sullivan has not ruled on his request to withdraw the guilty plea.
Among the documents is a redacted internal memo from Jan. 4, 2017, saying the FBI was closing out its investigation into whether a subject with the code name of Crossfire Razor was an agent of a foreign power or acting under the direction of Russia. The subject is described as a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who traveled to Russia in 2015.
Flynn's attorney Sidney Powell confirmed Thursday that Crossfire Razor was Flynn.
Those handwritten notes – written by the FBI's former assistant director of the Counterintelligence Division, Bill Priestap, Fox News is told –  suggested that agents planned in the alternative to get Flynn ""to admit to breaking the Logan Act"" when he spoke to then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period.  The Logan Act has never been used in a criminal prosecution and has a questionable constitutional status; it was enacted in 1799 in an era before telephones, and was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the United States government abroad, Fox contends.

Gretchen Whitmer signed three new executive orders extending the state's emergency and disaster declarations through May 28, saying scientific data shows the state isn't out of the woods yet.
 
""You can't put a hard and fast timeline because a lot of this depends on human behavior and our ability to observe these best practices,"" the governor said during an interview.
Some residents see it as government overreach and a power grab.
    
""I've had enough of being told what I can and cannot do. I've had enough of worrying about bills and making money,"" said Janine Pristley who showed up at the capitol Thursday to protest the governor.

""No one, especially a politician, has the right to devalue an individual by labeling them non-essential,"" argued Gregory Creswell, a Detroit resident who also showed up to protest.
There were tense moments. 
State Senator Dayna Polehanki tweeting, ""Directly above me, men with rifles yelling at us. Some of my colleagues who own bulletproof vests are wearing them.""
Michigan has been hit hard. According to the latest CDC numbers it has registered more than 40,000 cases and suffered nearly 3,700 deaths, but not everyone buys the numbers. 
""I do think that we have a virus, but I do think that the numbers are inflated. I think it's all political,"" said one protester.
Republicans who control the legislature think the governor is overstepping her authority.
    
""At this point in the COVID crisis what can the governor accomplish alone that she can't do together with the leadership of the House and the Senate?"" asked state Rep. Lynn Afendoulis speaking from the House floor.
The state House passed a resolution authorizing the speaker to take legal action against the governor for her actions during the pandemic.
She's already facing a number of lawsuits, including one by five businesses arguing her pandemic-related executive orders have ""Shuttered civil society, placed 10 million people under house arrest and taken jobs away from nearly 1.2 million people, all without due process of law.""
""My husband is an electrician and he cannot go back to work supposedly until May 7th as long as that goes through, but he can go out on a golf course as of today. I don't think it's fair to start making those provisions,"" said one woman protesting at the capitol.
 
""It is very important that we as Americans stand up for our Constitution and for our civil liberties because, as we know, the government continues to take and take,"" said Michael Farage, an organizer with American Patriot Rally.
Gov. Whitmer says she hopes to reopen certain sectors of the economy in the days ahead, but for now, she faces a political and legal battle over government power.

The former vice president flatly denied that he sexually assaulted one of his former Democratic staffers named Tara Reade. She accuses Biden of pushing her up against a wall, putting his hand up her skirt and violating her when he was a senator in 1993.
 
The allegation has gained traction in recent days after others supported Reade's account, including her brother, saying she previously told them about it.
After several leading Democrats said Biden should respond, he appeared today on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" program.
 
""No, it is not true,"" Biden stated. “I’m saying unequivocally, it never never happened.” 
Biden went on to say that women who come forward with allegations should be listened to but those claims should be investigated.
Although he was interviewed multiple times by major media organizations since the allegations surfaced, Biden was never asked about it until today.
“The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993,” Biden told MSNBC, “She does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files.”
“There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be – the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept,” he continued.
Conservatives have repeatedly argued that the media has treated the allegation against Biden far differently than those against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he was nominated for the high court in 2018.
Republican National Committee spokesman Steve Guest said, “The left, and their media allies, has one standard for Republicans and another standard for Democrats like Joe Biden.”
“The double standard,” he said, “is appalling.”

The former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee joined Biden in a women's online town hall on Tuesday.

Clinton's endorsement comes as new testimony is surfacing, supporting an accusation of sexual assault from a woman named Tara Reade who was a former aide to Biden when he was in the Senate.
The Biden campaign has strongly denied the allegations.
But Reade is furious about Clinton's endorsement. She told Fox News, ""I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. I voted for her in the primary. I'm a lifelong Democrat. But yet, what I see now is someone enabling a sexual predator and it was my former boss, Joe Biden, who raped me.""
""Hillary Clinton has a history of enabling powerful men to cover up their sexual predatory behaviors and their inappropriate sexual misconduct. We don't need that for this country. We don't need that for our new generation coming up that wants institutional rape culture to change,"" Reade continued.
Last spring, eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to be ""more mindful about respecting personal space in the future.""

Biden told Politico he wants far more spending to deal with COVID-19. He says one of the ways out of this economic crisis is through a $1 trillion infrastructure program to create new American jobs, along with environmental programs and massive aid for state and local governments.
However, Biden has been quiet about claims from a former staffer named Tara Reade who has publicly accused him of sexual assault in 1993. Describing an incident that she says happened while she was serving on Biden's Senate staff, Reade said Biden pushed her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building, groped her, and then reached under her skirt and touched her genitals. 
She said after telling her supervisors in Biden's office that she had been sexually harassed by the then-senator, her concerns weren't taken seriously and she was eventually told to find another job.
Two of those staffers have said in interviews that they didn't recall Reade or any such incident. The third issued an on-the-record statement denying Reade's claim.
Now, Reade's former neighbor is supporting that account. Lynda LaCasse says Reade detailed the alleged incident to her in the mid-90s.
""She felt like she was assaulted, and she really didn't feel there was anything she could do,"" LaCasse told Business Insider.
Late last week, the Intercept unearthed a 1993 video clip that shows a woman Reade says was her mother calling into CNN's ""Larry King Live."" In the clip, an unnamed woman from San Luis Obispo, Calif., tells King that her daughter just left Washington, ""after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.""
Last spring, eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to be ""more mindful about respecting personal space in the future.""
The Associated Press spoke with Reade about those complaints in April 2019. During that interview, Reade alleged that Biden rubbed her shoulders and neck and played with her hair and that she was asked by another aide in Biden's Senate office to dress more conservatively and told: ""don't be so sexy."" 
 Major media outlets have not asked Biden about the alleged assault. When Fox News asked the Biden campaign about the charge, it pointed to a previous statement saying while sexual assault claims should be ""diligently reviewed by an independent press,"" what Reade alleged, ""absolutely did not happen."""

Some blame a lack of widespread testing and differences in reporting standards that could be masking the extent of the virus's spread. 
President Trump is now hinting he may extend social distancing guidelines again next week as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has no plans to reopen his state anytime soon. 
""This is a remarkably effective virus at spreading and growing,"" Cuomo said. 
The New York governor says preliminary results reveal one in five New York City residents tested positive for antibodies to the coronavirus. 
This news comes as the number of new cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 is down, so is the death rate but it's still an alarming number. 
""Number of lives lost is still heartbreaking news, 422,"" Cuomo said. 
More than 2.7 million worldwide have been diagnosed with nearly 900,000 of those cases in the US. Still, some states began reopening this week.
It's back to business in Georgia with barbershops, bowling alleys, and salons opening for customers.
""We'll be doing temporal thermometer checks on clients and employees every day as they come in, prescreening them the day before we confirm their appointment,"" said Hairstylist Mark Demasso. 
But Trump says he's not happy with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's widespread lifting of restrictions.  
""I said you make your own decision,"" Trump said. I told him that. I said, you're not in the guidelines, but I'm letting you make your own decision, but I want people to be safe, and I want the people in Georgia to be safe.""
After emerging studies showed ultraviolet rays and bleach have been shown to kill the virus, Trump asked whether the idea might be used to treat COVID-19 patients but today pushed back on his remarks. 
""I was asking a sarcastically to reporters just like you to see what would happen,"" Trump said
Lysol released a statement in part saying ""under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body through injection, ingestion, or any other route.
Trump is now looking to a phase 4 stimulus package. Lawmakers are discussing a $2 trillion infrastructure deal to fix the nation's roads, railways, and bridges which would also create jobs, boost the economy.
The bill would also help restaurants, entertainment, and professional sports.

CBN News Chief Political Analyst David Brody talked with Marc Lotter, the campaign's director of strategic communications, about its massive volunteer effort, along with the criticism aimed at President Trump during the COVID-19 pandemic.
David Brody: ""What does campaigning look like right now specifically as it relates to this coronavirus situation. What are you guys doing exactly?
Marc Lotter: ""Well, I think one of the biggest misconceptions was that just what you saw in the President's rallies where the campaign and really all of the legwork the basic blocking and tackling, it was going on before the Coronavirus and it's going on during the Coronavirus. In fact, we have made about 10 million phone calls in about the last month added nearly 300,000 volunteers in just the last month alone and of course, our fundraising is continuing to be very, very strong. And that's because we have such a huge digital presence and data advantage. So while the president the vice president are focused on doing what they're supposed to be doing in the White House, dealing with the Coronavirus, the real the basic work of the campaign goes on and it continues on virtually even if it's not out there on a stage.""
 
David Brody: ""So you clearly believe you have an advantage from a virtual standpoint over Joe Biden, not just the bully pulpit, but what you're doing from a campaign standpoint?""
 
Marc Lotter: ""Oh, there's no question and I mean, we all we already know, we had the digital advantage from 2016. And all we have done is grow that presence even more, in fact, you know, it's been widely reported and discussed how sophisticated the digital operation that we have is, and the way the campaign is organized under Brad Parscale. We are very nimble, our ability to tailor our message to reach out to people with messages that impact them is rivaled by no one it is clearly above and beyond. And meanwhile, when you see Joe Biden's still struggling, barely able to get a couple of hundred thousand people may be on a good day to watch any of his videos compared to our millions. And that's not even with the President. That's with people like me. When we can do that, we've got a pretty strong foundation of support."" 
 
David Brody: ""Mark some criticism for the president, obviously on the coronavirus situation, the Pew Research poll just out on the last day or so saying that most Americans thought he was a bit slow to respond. I know China and the travel ban and all I get all that. But this is what Americans are saying at least in a pretty respected pew poll. They're also saying that they're concerned that we may go a little too fast back to reopen the economy. how much of this is going to be on the president to make sure this goes well, otherwise, that could be problems for the campaign going forward?""
 
Marc Lotter:  ""Well, when you're the leader when you're the elected official, it all falls upon you. And a lot of people I think are giving the president, correctly, praise for acting when he did to shut down travel from China in the affected area. While at the same time you had the mayor of New York, you had Nancy Pelosi encouraging people to continue to go out and celebrate the Chinese, the Lunar New Year in their communities you had obviously, you know, a lot of problems with that. And the President was attacked for being xenophobic and racist by Joe Biden and many other people when he took that decisive early step. And I think as we start to come out of this, and as we see states emerging from the shutdowns, as we see the economy kicking back up, then I think people are going to realize that the way the president handled this was best for our public health and our economic health. And to be honest with you, when you're looking at that economy that strong economy we had going into it, thank goodness we had a strong economy going into it. When you compare that with Joe Biden and the architects of the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. I think a lot of people are going to say we want the man who built the rocket ship to get us back on that rocket ship, post Coronavirus, and that'll be an easy choice with President Trump. So I think as more and more people emerge from this, they will have more comfort in the fact of how this was handled, and how we're preparing for the next one  And that bodes well for President Trump.""

In addition to your smart phone's many purposes, it could also become a personal bio-lab.
As pressure mounts for states to reopen, technology will soon tell us who's at risk of catching COVID-19. 
In Connecticut, the Westport Police Department tested a drone by DragonFly designed to monitor people's temperatures, heart rates, and respiratory rates. The device can also detect sneezing and coughing in a crowd, but the department grounded its plans after the public raised concerns about privacy.

""An extreme and disgusting overreach of government. Big brother is watching indeed,"" commented Mitchel Hoffman on the department's Facebook page.
""I am always committed to bringing our community the most innovative solutions to the public safety problems that it faces. Although I see the greater potential of this technology, I will always be responsive and respectful of the concerns of our citizens in every decision that I make,"" wrote Chief Foti Koskinas in a statement.
Meanwhile, Facebook is offering an opt-in symptom survey asking users to report if they have a fever, cough, or shortness of breath. The social media giant is then mapping responses from millions of Americans so hospitals can gauge what they may be in for, should those symptoms become acute.
This comes as Apple and Google develop a system to measure your risk by tracing your contacts. With these future apps, as your phone's Bluetooth comes into contact with other phones, they share strings of numbers. 
If you then test positive for COVID-19, you can send an alert to those phones you came in contact with so they know they're at potential risk.
The developers maintain your identifying information will be protected. 
""It's an amazing thing, but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problems with it,"" President Trump said at a recent press briefing.
UPLIFTING  'There Is Power in Prayer': Woman That Survived 9/11 Overcomes 2 COVID-19 Hospitalizations
The White House coronavirus task force is considering the implications. During crises, like after 9/11, Americans often prefer protection over civil liberty, but experts warn it's a slippery slope.
""COVID-19 is very scary, and issues of privacy and things are easy to fall by the wayside but very difficult to recover once they're compromised,"" explains Dean Cheng with The Heritage Foundation.
As companies reopen their doors, people may feel pressure to use this new technology to maintain their livelihoods.
""There could be employers who say you can't come to work unless you show your app or grocery stores who do the same thing, or maybe you can't get benefits – like unemployment benefits – unless you can prove you have that app,"" says Sarah Collins, policy counsel with Public Knowledge.
Testifying before senators this month, University of Washington School of Law Professor Ryan Calo said, ""A foreign operative who wished to sow chaos, an unscrupulous political operative who wished to dampen political participation, or a desperate business owner who's ought to shut down the competition, all could use self-reported instances of COVID-19...to achieve their goals.""
""The problem here is we don't have a federal privacy law, so this all has to come from written agreements with tech companies, with application developers, with governments. What we'd much rather see is these principles enshrined in law,"" Collins told CBN News.
She says those laws would need to include guarantees that only necessary data is collected and used for a specific purpose, and then deleted.

And since technology almost always moves much faster than the government, Cheng suggests lawmakers stick to the basics. 
""So what we need to start from are our principles, which hopefully haven't changed, that we value individual freedom, we value privacy, we value rights – we have rights of appeal and things like that,"" Cheng says.
For lawmakers, there's a delicate balance between keeping people safe and allowing them to be free.

Gyms, hair salons, even bowling alleys are open for business with modifications.
""We're not using our snack bar, we're not using our lounge,"" explains a bowling alley employee.
Georgia's fast reopening has drawn criticism from President Trump who disagrees with the pace, along with numerous lawmakers. Other states also plan to reopen, but under a more gradual phased-in approach as recommended by the administration.
""At the present moment 16 states have released formal reopening plans,"" Vice President Mike Pence told reporters during the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing Thursday.
He says the White House also encourages all states to restart elective surgeries wherever possible.
And promising news. New research by the Department of Homeland Security shows the coronavirus dies quickly when exposed to heat and humidity, add sunlight and it dies even faster.
""In the summer we know that summer-like conditions are going to create an environment where the transmission can be decreased and that's an opportunity for us to get ahead,"" explained Bill Bryan, science and technology advisor in the Department of Homeland Security.
However, he warns warm weather shouldn't replace enhanced hand washing, mask-wearing, or social distancing which President Trump says he may extend until early summer or beyond based on conditions across the country. 
""I think people are gonna know just out of common sense. At some point, we won't have to do that, but until we feel it's safe we're going to be extending,"" said President Trump.
Bryan used a playground as an example. He says any virus on the parts exposed to the sun will die quickly, but parts underneath that aren't exposed to direct sunlight could harbor the virus for longer periods of time.
The same government lab also tested disinfectants and found bleach kills the virus in five minutes while isopropyl alcohol kills it in 30 seconds and that's without rubbing. Rubbing the cleaners on surfaces kills the virus even faster.
""If we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead as states implement their policies - including phased reopening that will preserve those gains - we do believe by early summer we could be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus epidemic behind us,"" said the vice president.
And we're still learning more about the origins of the virus. A new study published by researchers at Hong Kong University reveals four times more people were infected in China than the official numbers released by the Chinese government.
The US and Australia are pushing for an international investigation into the origin of the virus and the behavior of China and the World Health Organization.

China's 'Deliberate' and 'Malign' Motives: Was the Coronavirus Released from a Chinese Lab?
Dependence on Generic Chinese-Made Drugs: Could the US be at China's Mercy During COVID-19 Pandemic?
Secretary Pompeo says it doesn’t help matters when countries like China, Russia, and Iran are all pushing bogus theories about how the virus started, such as it coming from US troops or an American bioweapon being used for political purposes. It begs the question: Is this a coordinated effort? 
“Boy, it's hard to know the answer to that,” says Pompeo. “But you can say they're observing what the others are doing and then they're responding in a group. That is, they're taking information being provided by one, and others are promoting it online and elsewhere too. This disinformation campaign matters. The American people, people all across the world go-to sources to get information, information for their safety, information for their health and that of their family members. It is nasty when the government runs a disinformation campaign that puts those people's lives at risk and their health at risk…these governments need to stop and they need to stop doing it in a coordinated way as well, if that's what's actually taking place.”
When pressed to fully discount the fact that this could be a coordinated effort, Secretary Pompeo responded directly. “We see very similar messages propagated by very similar means. It's difficult to know the level of coordination.” 
The WHO Failed to Protect the World
What Pompeo does know is that the World Health Organization botched its role in protecting citizens. That led the president to temporarily stop providing funding. But what would it take to get the WHO back in good standing with the United States at this point? 
“Boy David, it's hard to know,” says Pompeo. “It's important that your viewers understand the history of the World Health Organization as well. This is not the first time that that institution has failed to protect the world. You may recall SARS. The same kind of thing happened where the WHO was unable to do its primary function, stopping a pandemic from spreading across the world. And this time, they were unable to. You can see it. They said, ‘don't close your borders.’ President Trump made the decision to do that and keep the American people safe. They were too slow in declaring that this was something that could transmit from human to human. Those are the kinds of things that the WHO has failed in.” 
Pompeo: China's Bad Behavior Escalated When Obama/Biden Let Them 'Walk All Over US' 
Democrats say it’s the Trump administration that failed to take early action against the virus. Recently, the presumptive Democrat nominee for president Joe Biden said he would have sent health experts to China. Pompeo strenuously pushed back against that. 
“This president and this administration worked diligently to work to get Americans on the ground there in China to help, the World Health Organization, tried to get in there as well. We were rebuffed. The Chinese government wouldn't let it happen.” 
Pompeo wasn’t finished as he lowered the boom on Biden’s time inside the White House. 
“The previous administration allowed China to walk all over us and gain trade, grant opportunities, create wealth and trade benefits for China. This president has taken a fundamentally 180 degrees different approach with respect to how we respond to the challenges that China presents to American security.""
When asked directly whether he believes the Obama administration was soft on China, he didn’t mince words. “Relative to this administration, they were wildly soft.” 
Iran Can't Be Allowed to Threaten US Ships
This current administration has been anything but soft on the country of Iran. This week, the regime provocatively launched a military satellite into orbit and President Trump ordered America’s military to sink any Iranian boats harassing US ships. Pompeo has said Iran needs to be held accountable for what they've done. But how? 
“What we intend to do is to gather the nations across the world,” Secretary Pompeo tells CBN News. “The French put out a statement today (Thursday). They too know how dangerous and destabilizing what Iran did. I’m confident that there will now be more countries that understand what President Trump has understood, since he first came into office: that the Iran deal was a crazy bad deal; that we all need to move away from it; that the world needs to disassociate itself from Iran; and that the community of nations needs to come together and convince the Iranian regime to cease their activity which has led to them being the world's largest state sponsor of terror for so many years.” 
To be sure, given terror threats in key regions plus a hidden enemy threatening the world, this secretary faces a challenge not seen in generations.

The measure passed almost unanimously, but the lopsided tally belies a potentially bumpier path ahead as battle lines are being formed for much more ambitious future legislation that may prove far more difficult to maneuver through Congress.
The bipartisan measure neared passage as lawmakers gathered in Washington as a group for the first time since March 27, adopting stricter social distancing rules while seeking to prove they can do their work despite the COVID-19 crisis.
Lawmakers’ face masks and bandannas added a somber tone to their effort to aid a nation staggered by the health crisis and devastating economic costs of the pandemic.
“Millions of people out of work,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 deaths, a huge number of people impacted, and the uncertainty of it all. We hope to soon get to a recovery phase. But right now we’re still in mitigation.”
Anchoring the bill is the Trump administration’s $250 billion funding request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-sized businesses with payroll, rent, and other expenses. The payroll program provides forgivable loans so businesses can continue paying workers while forced to stay closed for social distancing and stay-at-home orders.
It also contains $100 billion demanded by Democrats for hospitals and a nationwide testing program, along with a $60 billion set-aside for small banks and an alternative network of community development banks that focus on development in urban neighborhoods and rural areas ignored by many lenders. There’s also $60 billion for small-business loans and grants delivered through the Small Business Administration’s existing disaster aid program.
President Donald Trump celebrated the bill’s passage at his daily White House briefing Thursday. “At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll,” he said.
The 388-5 vote — with Rep. Justin Amash, I-Mich., voting “present” — came at the end of a nettlesome path to passage. Republicans sought immediate action on Trump’s “clean” request for the small business money — backed by powerful, GOP-leaning business groups — but Democrats demanded equal funding for their priorities, frustrating Republicans who accused them of seeking leverage during the crisis. Republicans said delays in replenishing the paycheck subsidy program probably pushed some struggling businesses over the edge into closure.
Signs of the pandemic were everywhere in the House chamber Thursday. As Pelosi spoke from the floor, she lowered a white scarf that had covered much of her face. House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow protective mask, and most lawmakers and aides on the chamber’s sparsely populated floor wore masks as well.
With the entire Capitol closed to the public, visitors’ galleries were set aside for lawmakers in an effort to separate them.

Passage of more coronavirus relief is likely in the weeks ahead. Supporters are already warning that the business-backed Payroll Protection Program will exhaust the new $250 billion almost immediately. Launched just weeks ago, the program quickly reached its lending limit after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help.
Pelosi and allies like Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., said the next measure will distribute more relief to individuals, extend more generous jobless benefits into the fall, provide another round of direct payments to most people and help those who are laid off afford health insurance through COBRA.
Democrats tried to win another round of funding for state and local governments in Thursday’s bill but were rebuffed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who says he’s going to try pump the brakes on runaway deficit spending. McConnell says he doesn’t want to bail out Democratic-governed states for fiscal problems that predated the pandemic, but there’s plenty of demand for state fiscal relief among Republicans, too.
After the Senate passed the latest bill Tuesday, McConnell declared that Republicans would entertain no more coronavirus rescue legislation until the Senate returns to Washington, promising rank-and-file Republicans greater say in the future legislation, rather than leaving it in the hands of top bipartisan leaders.
Pelosi attacked McConnell for at first opposing adding any money to his original $250 billion package and saying cash-strapped states should be allowed to declare bankruptcy, a move that they currently cannot do and that would threaten a broad range of state services. McConnell’s comments provoked an outcry — including from GOP governors — and he later tempered his remarks.
“Oh, really?” Pelosi said. “What made you think that was a good idea?”
Thursday’s measure brings total rescue funding over the four measures, as measured by the cumulative deficit impact of spending proposals and tax cuts, to $2.4 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Each day brings new evidence of the economic calamity wrought by the virus. Thursday morning the government reported that 4.4 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week as layoffs sweep the economy. Over the last five weeks, roughly 26 million people have filed for jobless aid or about one in six U.S. workers.
The state of Michigan announced this week that it is temporarily laying off almost 3,000 workers.
All told, the four coronavirus relief bills crafted by Congress would deliver at least $2.4 trillion for business relief, testing and treatment, and direct payments to individuals and the unemployed, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The deficit is virtually certain to breach $3 trillion this year and is likely to go well above that when CBO issues new data as early as Friday.
Among the candidates for aid in the next bill is the Postal Service, which has more than 600,000 workers but is getting clobbered by COVID-19-related revenue losses.
In a related matter, the House used a party-line 212-182 vote Thursday to establish a special committee to oversee how the Trump administration spends the huge sums of money Congress is providing to battle the coronavirus. Republicans accused Democrats of playing politics with the crisis, but Democrats said Congress needs to keep an eye on the effort.

Rand Paul Warns US Debt Nearing 'Point of No Return', Backs Calls to Reopen Economy ","WASHINGTON - A new coronavirus relief package passed Congress Thursday night, bringing nearly $500 billion in aid for American businesses that are struggling to survive the COVID-19 closures.
As the COVID-19 pandemic cratered the economy, the White House vowed to spend whatever it takes to help the American people recover. Now, four relief bills and almost $3 trillion later, some are warning about future consequences from the unprecedented spending. 
Before the ink was even dry on the latest multi-billion dollar aid package this week, talks in Congress were already underway for more mammoth spending, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) says it's time to pump the breaks.
""My view is we've gone so far on the national debt here that the next time we address this issue, the Senate should be back in session fully up and running with everybody involved in the discussions,"" McConnell told reporters this week.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is ready to get to work on another bill aimed at helping the frontline heroes.
""We have health care workers, transit workers, police, fire, EMS, all kinds of public employees who risk their lives to save lives and now lose their jobs. And this is most unfortunate,"" Pelosi said.
But McConnell is urging his colleagues to consider future implications and assess what's working from the previous bills.
""Unless we get our economy up and running again there is not any way we can spend enough to continue to prop up the country,"" warned McConnell. 
The $2.8 trillion price tag of the relief bills thus far sparked this warning from Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).    
""The gargantuan federal bailout that just passed over $2 trillion brings us closer and closer to a point of no return,"" said Paul on the Senate floor this week. ""A point at which the world loses confidence in the dollar. A point at which our debt becomes an existential threat to our security.""
Paul agrees with McConnell that reopening the economy is the only way out.
""No amount of money, not all the money in China, will save us from ourselves,"" added Paul. ""Our only hope of rescuing this great country is to reopen the economy.""
President Trump says he's concerned with the growing debt, but there hasn't been another choice.
""I'm always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem because we were attacked,"" said Trump at a press conference Wednesday.
With the latest round of small business loans likely to run out as quickly as the first, lawmakers are hoping clarified language in this latest bill will ensure the money truly goes to the businesses that need it most.

That means 26 million Americans have now lost their jobs due to the coronavirus closures. But the president says the country is prepared to handle another virus outbreak, even though there's still a long road ahead. 
Many Americans are not just worried about the virus right now, but about what might happen this winter. President Trump is downplaying that concern and pushing back against what the CDC director said earlier this week. Trump tweeted, ""CDC Director was totally misquoted by Fake News."" 
CDC Director Robert Redfield told the Washington Post, ""There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.""
But Wednesday night during the coronavirus task force briefing, Redfield stood at the podium and clarified. ""I didn't say that this was going to be worse. I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated,"" he said. 
Redfield said the potential twin challenge of dealing with both the coronavirus and the flu could be tough and he urged Americans to get their flu shots in the fall.
The president is also pushing back against the governor of Georgia. On Friday, Gov. Brian Kemp will allow some businesses like bowling alleys and hair salons to reopen. 
On Fox News, Kemp characterized it as a ""measured approach with a lot of different requirements and guidance that we're going to be putting out.""
Critics have questioned the decision, saying that Georgia is moving slowly with its tracking and testing for the virus.
The president said publicly Wednesday that he thinks Georgia is reopening too quickly. ""I told the governor very simply that I disagree with his decision - but he has to do what he thinks is right,"" he said.
In California, Governor Gavin Newsom has taken a small step to reopen. He says he'll allow elective surgeries in hospitals which will allow thousands of healthcare workers to go back to work.
He's also ordering a statewide investigation to figure out when the epidemic actually started. A new report from Santa Clara County shows that two people with the virus died up to three weeks before the US reported its first death from the disease.
In Washington, DC, the House is set to pass an almost $500 billion virus relief bill today. The real fight now centers on the next bill and how much aid state and local governments will get in the next go-around.

The bill designates an additional $310 billion towards the Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of money last week. It also allocates $75 billion in hospital relief and $25 billion for increased coronavirus testing. 
""This is a real victory for the smaller businesses,"" declared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) after the Senate passed the bill. ""Who really didn't have the banking relationships, but they don't need them under this legislation as it is passed.""
Before this latest relief package even hits the President's desk, talks are already underway for more help, which Pelosi says will support frontline heroes.

0,2020-04-22T14:30:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/april/social-security-and-medicare-funds-at-risk-even-before-virus,Social Security and Medicare Funds at Risk Even Before Virus,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The financial conditions of the government’s two biggest benefits programs remain shaky, with Medicare projected to become insolvent in six years and Social Security on track to no longer be able to pay full benefits starting in 2035.
And that’s without accounting for the impact of the coronavirus, which is sure to impose further pressure on the two programs.
For Social Security, the projected 2035 date for exhausting the trust fund reserves means that it would be able to pay only 79% of benefits at that time.
The projected timetables, which remained unchanged from last year’s estimates, were revealed Wednesday with the release of the annual trustees' reports of both programs.
Even if employment rebounds by the end of this year and payroll taxes return to near-normal levels, the shock from the pandemic shutdown could accelerate the depletion of the Social Security trust fund by about six months, officials told reporters.
If a recession extends into next year, it could mean that depletion would come a full year earlier. The consequences may be worse for the Medicare program, which in this report is estimated to deplete its reserves in 2026.
The expected recession, projected by economists to be the deepest since the 1930s, will mean fewer people paying into Social Security and Medicare. Compounding the problem, the pandemic will impose heavier caseloads on the health program, which provides care for those 65 and older.
“Next year’s report will be a much more important report because it will take into account what we’re experiencing now,” said William Arnone, CEO of the nonpartisan National Academy of Social Insurance, which works on education and policy.
More than 20 million workers have been laid off so far. As a consequence, they and their employers are no longer sending in payroll taxes to support Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare’s giant trust fund for inpatient care.
People forced to retire because of job loss could see their lifetime Social Security checks reduced because the earnings they expected to receive from work won’t be factored into the calculation of their benefits. A year is no small sacrifice for older workers who are at or near their peak earning capacity.
“That will be reflected in next year’s report,” Arnone said.
Medicare’s Part B premium for outpatient care is projected to go up by about $9 next year, to $153.30 a month.
The impact on Medicare spending may be harder to sort out, said Fred Riccardi, president of the Medicare Rights Center advocacy group. That’s because of a push-pull effect on spending.
“The demographics of this are that people on Medicare are the most severely impacted,” Riccardi said, noting that older people suffer the worst consequences of COVID-19. Hospitalizations will raise Medicare spending.
“But we also know that the stay-at-home order has put elective surgery and treatment on hold,” Riccardi continued. Older people are also the most likely to need hip and knee replacements and other procedures now paused, and that would tend to lower projected Medicare spending.
The dates are the years that both programs will exhaust their trust funds When that happens, Social Security will have to cut benefits that many recipients depend on, or lawmakers will have to raise the payroll tax. Medicare would have to cut its payments to hospitals, nursing homes, and other medical providers unless taxes are increased.
The annual trustees' reports contain the same general warnings they’ve carried for years. Both benefit programs need to make adjustments to become financially sound. But the choices of cutting benefits or raising taxes to bring that about remain politically unpalatable to most lawmakers.
Instead, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has called for expanding both programs. On Social Security Biden would increase benefits, especially for people of modest incomes, while raising more revenue from upper-income earners.
President Donald Trump pledged during the 2016 campaign not to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits. Before the pandemic, he said in an interview that his administration would be taking a look at benefit programs, but the White House press office pushed back on suggestions he was opening the door to cuts.
Various proposals have been put forward. They include reducing the annual cost of living benefit increases for Social Security, raising payroll taxes, or raising the retirement age for Medicare. Yet there is little political appetite for such changes.

""Unless we get our economy up and running again there is not any way we can spend enough to continue to prop up the country,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, (R-KY).
$383 billion of this latest stimulus bill will be earmarked specifically for small business programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program.
""We want to make sure this money is available to small businesses that need it, people who have invested their entire life savings,"" Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin said at Tuesday's White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing. 
The new legislation is on its way to the House after being passed Tuesday by the Senate. Meanwhile, much of the country is working to re-open.
""Twenty states representing 40 percent of the population, have announced that they are making plans and preparations to safely restart their economies in the very near future,"" President Trump announced Tuesday.
Still, some of the states rushing to re-open don't meet the White House guidelines. Georgia's governor is preparing to open gyms, bowling alley's, and barbershops this week, despite not seeing a two-week decline in cases of COVID-19.
""When we have more people moving around we're probably going to see more cases continue to go up but we're a lot better prepared now than we were over a month ago,"" Gov. Brian Kemp said.
Atlanta's mayor plans to disregard the order.
""I certainly cannot in good conscience say that I agree with his order and I will continue to use my voice as mayor of Atlanta to ask people to continue to stay home, follow the science, and exercise common sense,"" said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
CDC Director Robert Redfield warned that a second wave of COVID-19 could coincide with the start of flu season and prove to be even more devastating than what we now face. Dr. Deborah Birx says, if there is another wave, the country will be much better prepared.
""We are going to continue that surveillance from now all the way through the fall to be able to give us that early warning signal,"" Birx said during Tuesday's briefing. 
Meanwhile, the FDA says its granted emergency clearance to the first in-home test for COVID-19. And, in the United Kingdom, researchers at Oxford University are beginning the first human trials on a potential vaccine.

The passage was swift and unanimous, despite opposition from conservative Republicans, and President Donald Trump tweeted his support, pledging to sign it into law.
“The Senate is continuing to stand by the American people,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
It now goes to the House, where lawmakers have been summoned back to Washington for votes on Thursday.
After nearly two weeks of negotiations and deadlock, Congress and the White House reached an agreement Tuesday on the nearly $500 billion package — the fourth as Washington strains to respond to the health and economic crisis.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the bill was made “better and broader” after Democrats forced the inclusion of money for hospitals and testing.
A copy of the measure was provided to The Associated Press by a GOP aide.
Most of the funding, $331 billion, would go to boost a small-business payroll loan program that ran out of money last week. An additional $75 billion would be given to hospitals, and $25 billion would be spent to boost testing for the virus, a key step in building the confidence required to reopen state economies.
Missing from the package, however, was extra funding for state and local governments staring down budget holes and desperate to avert furloughs and layoffs of workers needed to keep cities running.
Trump said he was open to including in a subsequent virus aid package fiscal relief for state and local government — which Democrats wanted for the current bill — along with infrastructure projects.
Not all Republicans are backing Trump on the deal.
Two conservative Republicans, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voiced opposition during Tuesday’s session but did not halt passage.
Lee said it was “unacceptable” that the full Senate was not present and voting in the pro forma session, citing a strict reading of the Constitution.
Paul said no amount of federal funding will be able to salvage a shuttered economy. “Deaths from infectious disease will continue, but we cannot continue to indefinitely quarantine,” said Paul, who tested positive for the virus last month but has since recovered.
The House is being called to Washington for a Thursday vote, said Rep. Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, on a conference call with reporters.
Hoyer, D-Md., said the House will also vote on a proposal to allow proxy voting on future business during the pandemic, a first for Congress, which has required in-person business essentially since its founding.
“The House must show the American people that we continue to work hard on their behalf,” Hoyer wrote to colleagues.
But the landmark rules change met with objections from conservative Republicans in the House.
“I don’t support it at all,” said Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., one of a handful of Republicans who showed up for Tuesday’s pro forma session to protest proxy votes. “Congress should be in session.”
Signaling concerns, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., wrote Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., seeking more information on plans to reopen the House.
The emerging virus aid package — originally designed by Republicans as a $250 billion stopgap to replenish the payroll subsidies for smaller businesses — has grown into the second-largest of the four coronavirus response bills so far.
Democratic demands have caused the measure to balloon, though Republicans support additions for hospitals and testing.
The new $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program includes $60 billion or so set aside for — and divided equally among — smaller banks and community lenders that seek to focus on underbanked neighborhoods and rural areas. Democrats have highlighted the number of smaller and minority-owned shops missing out on the aid.
Another $60 billion would be available for a small-business loans and grants program delivered through an existing small business disaster aid program, $10 billion of which would come in the form of direct grants.
The bill provides $25 billion for increased testing efforts, including at least $11 billion to state and tribal governments to detect and track new infections. The rest will help fund federal research into new coronavirus testing options.
Currently, the U.S. has tested roughly 4 million people for the virus, or just over 1% of its population, according to the COVID Tracking Project website.
While the White House says the U.S. has enough testing to begin easing social distancing measures, most experts say capacity needs to increase at least threefold, if not more.
Despite yet another big package from Congress, all sides say more aid is likely needed in the next bill. There’s pressure to help cities with populations of less than 500,000 that were shut out of the massive $2 trillion relief bill that passed last month.
Schumer said Monday that he had talked to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell and that Powell said the Fed is working to open up the Main Street Lending program to nonprofits and municipal governments.
The government’s Paycheck Protection Program has been swamped by companies applying for loans and reached its appropriations limit last Thursday after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help.
Controversies have enveloped the program, with many businesses complaining that banks have favored customers with whom they already do business. Some businesses that haven’t been harmed much by the pandemic have also received loans, along with a number of publicly traded corporations.

He plans to sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the US. 
Trump says he made this decision ""in light of the attack from the invisible enemy"" and ""the need to protect"" American jobs. 
The White House released a statement saying: ""President Trump is committed to protecting the health and economic well-being of American citizens as we face unprecedented times.  As President Trump has said, 'Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.'

Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TEXAS) called it ""an attempt to divert attention away from Trump's failure to stop the spread of the coronavirus and save lives."" 
Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) called it ""xenophobic scapegoating."" 
Trump's move comes as several states begin to loosen restrictions, including South Carolina where some retail businesses are opening today. 
""We still encourage people to use curbside pickup and delivery and shipping so we can all stay home and get out of this sooner,"" said South Carolina residents Leslie and Catherine Gouge. ""But we're excited about the future.""
Tennessee is waiting a bit longer, announcing the ""vast majority"" will reopen May 1. 
Georgia has declared gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. 
""By taking this measured action, we will get Georgians back to work safely,"" said Gov. Brian Kemp (R). 
Kemp added that movie theaters and restaurants will be allowed to open Monday. 
But critics want to continue the lockdown, pointing to the 800 deaths and 20,000 cases of coronavirus in the state.
""I certainly cannot in good conscience say that I agree with this order and I will continue to use my voice as mayor of Atlanta ask people to continue to stay home, follow the science, and exercise common sense,"" said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
California is not seeing the downward trend in cases that are needed to reopen.

New York City, the hardest-hit city in the country has canceled all non-essential events through June. The Big Apple is seeing the death numbers drop but is still reporting 1,000 new cases of the coronavirus each day.

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” Trump tweeted.
  
He offered no details as to what immigration programs might be affected by the order. The White House did not immediately elaborate on Trump's tweeted announcement.
  
Trump has taken credit for his restrictions on travel to the U.S. from China and hard-hit European countries, arguing it contributed to slowing the spread of the virus in the U.S. But he has yet to extend those restrictions to other nations now experiencing virus outbreaks. 
  
Due to the pandemic, almost all visa processing by the State Department, including immigrant visas, has been suspended for weeks.

Cotton also made a bold claim that China may have intentionally allowed the virus to leave their country.
""They continued to encourage travel outside of China to the rest of the world,"" Cotton said. ""I believe that was a deliberate decision that was designed to seed cases around the world so China wouldn't be the only nation that suffered a relative decline of its power.""
President Trump echoes Cotton's skepticism of China's reporting and handling of the crisis.
""Does anyone believe (China's) number?"" asked Trump over the weekend. ""We saw more bags on television than that.""
And the President adds if they knowingly are responsible for the global pandemic, they should be held accountable.
""Well if they (China) were knowingly responsible, certainly. If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake,"" continued Trump. ""But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences.""
As the US death toll topped 40,000 this week, Trump predicted that number is still growing by the thousands.
""I think that right now we're heading around 60, maybe 65,000,"" Trump said.
Even with that projection, thousands continue to gather in large groups to protest stay at home orders around the country calling for their states to reopen, seemingly with the president's blessing.
""I just think that some of the governors have gotten carried away,"" commented Trump.
Several Democratic governors who are calling for more testing to be done before restrictions are lifted are upset by Trump's seeming support of the large protests.
""To have an American president to encourage people to violate the law - it is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives,"" said Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA).
Even some members of Trump's Coronavirus Task Force are warning against lifting restrictions too quickly.
""If you jump the gun and go into a situation where you have a big spike, you're going to set yourself back,"" warned Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday.
On Monday, the World Health Organization warned on a global level, they fear the worst of the virus is still to come. They didn't specify why they believe that, but some experts are pointing to an inevitable increase in cases across Africa where health care is far less advanced and accessible."

Ignoring Deaths Caused by Unemployment? Answering the Trickiest Pandemic Questions,"How do ethics figure into a pandemic? That's what some thought leaders were considering as they debated the thorniest moral questions presented by this pandemic during a Heritage Foundation webinar.
 
For instance, does whatever a state decides it must do to protect its citizens' health overrule every civil liberty and guaranteed constitutional right?
 
The US Constitution limited government and insisted it must not infringe on its citizens' God-given rights. But it also granted the states' police powers to protect its citizens.
 
So in a pandemic, what happens to the First Amendment right to assemble and the right to religious freedom?   
 
""If people want to protest the government's policies, may they assemble to protest or may the government prevent the assembly?"" asked Christian philosopher Robert George.
 
The Princeton professor added, ""All the various faiths are under rules in many states that forbid them from gathering for worship.  Is that constitutionally permissible? That actually turns out to be a complex question. We have to respect civil liberties while still acknowledging that the states do exercise police powers - which are broad, which are plenary, which are general - to protect public health and safety.""
 
Catholic University of America's Melissa Moschella, a philosophy professor, agreed it's a thorny matter, but drew a firm line in the proverbial sand.
 
A State Can Forbid Gatherings, but Not Unequally
 
She stated, ""It will always be illegitimate for the government to single out religion for special discrimination. So, for instance, it would be wrong for the government to say, 'We're going to forbid religious services of over 50 people' if it doesn't also forbid every other gathering of over 50 people. Unless there was something specific about religious services that made them more likely to transmit disease or something like that, in this circumstance.""
 
""And I think that we can see in this time of pandemic, what the data makes clear is that the most dangerous thing… the greatest source of the rapid spread of this virus… are situations in which you have large groups of people in very friendly, close contact,"" she added.
 
Like in-person church services.
 
No Less Burdensome Way to Do This
 
""Therefore there is a reason across the board – a compelling state interest in terms of protection of human life and health – to, for a time, forbid such large gatherings,"" Moschella explained.  ""Yes, It is a burden on the free exercise of religion. But there is no less burdensome way at this point to achieve that goal. But again, it has to be even-handed.""
 
In other words, if a state is going to allow drive-up restaurants or stores, it has to be even-handed when it comes to drive-in religious services.
 
""That seems to be no more risky than other sorts of things we are allowing,"" Moschella argued. ""So I think the key thing is to make sure that religion is not given any kind of special disadvantage.""
 
How Many Lives Will be Lost From the Supposed Cure?
 
Another huge controversy is how much the vast shutting down of America has wounded its people and if it's worth it in the light of how many lives the shutdown might be saving from the coronavirus?
 
Heritage Senior Research Fellow Ryan Anderson said, ""We've taken pretty severe measures to try to combat COVID-19.  They seem to be somewhat effective in flattening the curve.  But those measures have costs, and not just in people's 401K.  I think some of the rhetoric around this – saying, 'If you care about the economy it means you don't care about grandma' – there's been bad rhetoric on both sides of these debates.  But real human beings – their livelihoods, their flourishing – have been put at risk.""   
 
He concluded, ""This has to take a toll on people.""
 
What if It Could Kill Hundreds of Millions?
 
But with so much unknown about the coronavirus and how much damage it could do worldwide, Harvard Professor of Epidemiology Tyler VanderWeele argued, ""Given the level of uncertainty we have, I do think that the lockdown measures and the social distancing are good, because what we really want to prevent is the extreme scenario of this spreading everywhere and killing millions and tens of millions… hundreds of millions of people.  That scenario now doesn't seem overly likely.  But in the absence of information, I think it is important to try to protect against that possibility.""
 
On the other hand Anderson argued, ""Policy-makers have to be concerned with the common good.  And the common good here is multi-faceted.  It's not just saving as many lives as possible.  It's also the economic considerations.  It's the human flourishing considerations.  It's the depression, the anxiety, the loneliness – all of those things need to be taken into consideration.""
 
Depression, Loneliness, Unemployment Also Kill
 
VanderWeele went so far as to admit those harms also lead to death, saying, ""We certainly do know that depression, that loneliness, that lack of social support, that unemployment does lead to higher mortality.  There are very good studies indicating this.""   
 
He says it's hard to calculate right now how much this present crisis is adding to deaths caused by depression, loneliness, lack of social support and unemployment, ""But that the measures we've put in place are contributing to an increased mortality is very clear.""
 
If Rationing Becomes a Reality, Deciding Who Should Die
 
Another ethical issue is deciding who should be left to die if 
there comes a time in this pandemic of such shortages of medical equipment or care that it must be rationed.
 
Prof. George insisted caregivers in such a circumstance must remember, ""The profound inherent and equal dignity of each and every member of the human family.  That's bedrock.""
 
""Human beings are tempted to begin dividing the world up into superiors and inferiors,"" he said. ""The temptation will be to put people who are aging, who are elderly, or people who are disabled, suffering cognitive impairment or physical disabilities in an inferior class. That absolutely has to be resisted.""
 
'That's Not Really a Life Worth Living'
 
He added, ""Here's where the temptation comes. The temptation is to look at that person with Down syndrome or look at that person with dementia or look at that person with muscular dystrophy, and say, 'That's not really a life worth living,' or 'it's not as important a life as the strong, healthy, beautiful, highly intelligent other person.'""
 
Moschella said, ""We should never be making those decisions with the mentality, 'Is this person's life worth saving? Does this person have a quality of life that is sufficient to render them worthy of this treatment?""
 
If rationing should become necessary, Moschella insisted, ""We should not be thinking about is a life with somebody that has a disability worth living? Or is a life of somebody who is older equally worth living by comparison with a younger person? Those are considerations that should be off the table because of that bedrock principle of the equal fundamental dignity of every human person.""
 
Decide Who CAN Benefit, Not Who SHOULD
 
Dr. Farr Curlin of the Duke University School of Medicine and Divinity School suggested medical professionals in a time of shortages can use this as a standard - picking who CAN benefit from treatment, not who SHOULD benefit.
 
Then they're no longer having to randomly, as Curlin put it, ""Make a judgment between Patient A and Patient B.""
 
Moschella added, ""So when we're thinking these things through, we need to be thinking about 'who is most likely to benefit from the treatment in terms of their clinical profile… who is most likely to actually recover if we provide the treatment?""
 
She concluded, ""In a case of scarcity, that's a reasonable way of trying to make that decision. It's not a judgment on the value of a particular person's life. Instead, it's a judgment on who is likely to benefit most from getting this scarce treatment?""
 
George weighed in, saying, ""We cannot relegate anybody, however weak, vulnerable, poor – whatever deficiencies they may have, whatever they may be lacking – we cannot relegate them to inferior status.  Because their dignity, their fundamental value is no less than anyone else's.""
 
We Are Divine & Valuable: A Civilizational Principle
 
The professor went on, ""We cannot fall into what's sometimes called a utilitarian way of thinking where we imagine that the correct policy is the one that does the greatest good for the greatest number, as if human beings could be weighed and measured in their value in a way that would make that principle workable.""
 
""Man is made in the very image and likeness of God, the very image and likeness of the divine Creator of the universe. And that's the source of our dignity,"" George explained. ""That principle is there, not just as a religious and moral principle, but as a civilizational principle.""
 
God Has Not Abandoned Us
 
Even though these days are hard, speaking to people made in the image of God and loved by their Creator, Curlin wanted to say, ""Remember that God has not abandoned us. You can be alone and not be lonely if you are experiencing God and paying attention to how God is present to you. So this is a time to remember that.""

A new report from the Associated Press shows China waited six key days after determining they were facing a global crisis to alert the public, and the communist regime repeatedly underreported the deaths and the total number of infections in the origin country.
Today, China admitted their death toll is at least 50 percent higher than first reported. The city of Wuhan, the epicenter for the COVID-19 outbreak, added 1,290 deaths to its toll, bringing the total to 3,869 after many dead were ""mistakenly reported"" or missed entirely.
The new numbers add to growing global doubts over China's transparency. Leaders in France and Britain joined President Trump's broadsides against China, as two US media outlets reported suspicions the virus accidentally slipped out of a sensitive Wuhan laboratory that studied bats. French President Emmanuel Macron told the Financial Times it would be ""naive"" to think China had handled the pandemic well, saying, ""There are clearly things that have happened that we don't know about.""

China's 'Deliberate' and 'Malign' Motives: Was the Coronavirus Released from a Chinese Lab?
Dependence on Generic Chinese-Made Drugs: Could the US be at China's Mercy During COVID-19 Pandemic?
US Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said on Fox News this week that something needs to be done to hold China's regime accountable. ""The Chinese communist party is responsible for every single death, every single job loss, every retirement nest egg lost from this coronavirus and Xi Jinping and his Chinese communist apparatchiks must be made to pay the price,"" he said.
Sen. Cotton has faced criticism as a conspiracy theorist for sounding alarm bells since the very beginning on China's mishandling of the crisis.
Now, even some mainstream media outlets like the Washington Post seem to be agreeing with Cotton's concerns. Cotton told Fox News this week it's time for action against China. 
""I think we need to make the American courts open for lawsuits against Chinese communist leaders,"" continued Cotton.
 
Gordon Chang, author of The Coming Collapse of China, agrees with Cotton's theory that the virus may have come from a bio lab accident in Wuhan, China, the pandemic's epicenter.
 
""In terms of motivation, this is a really important question. Because even though this was an accidental release, Beijing had malign motives,"" claims Chang. ""Because as I mentioned, they knew about the human-to-human transmissibility of this. They urged countries to accept travelers from China.""
 
Chang told CBN News' Faith Nation he questions the numbers China's been reporting. 
 
""In any reporting, you're going to have some delays, but in China, in addition to that, you're also having deliberate falsification, because the gap is too large. And we have seen, for instance, in Wuhan—the epicenter—all of those tens of thousands of urns. Those numbers have not even been reported even now,"" continued Chang. ""What we have not seen is the reporting in China catch up for what was obviously the underreporting in the beginning. And that's the real sin.""

Chang says he's also concerned with the Chinese government's efforts to prevent foreign researchers from studying the origin of the outbreak.
 
""And we know that Beijing is trying to suppress information so they've got information to hide,"" he continued.
  
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, however, isn't convinced of the lab theory. ""This is something we've been watching closely now for some time. The results are inconclusive,"" Esper told NBC News ""Today"". 
""The majority of the views right now is that it is natural, that it was organic. But I think we need to continue to work this and once we get beyond the pandemic, we'll have a chance to look back and really find out what happened and then to take the proper precautions to make sure that we prevent this in the future,"" Esper said.
  
Adding to the tension between the US and China are new reports China might be secretly conducting nuclear tests.
 
China refutes the accusations it failed to comply with a suspension of nuclear tests, and says that reports the coronavirus originated in one of their labs have ""no scientific basis"".

""We're opening up our country and we have to do that. America wants to be open,"" President Trump said at his daily coronavirus briefing at the White House Thursday.
The president and his task force suggest states reopen gradually as their cases of COVID-19 decrease.
In phase one, churches, theaters, and some sports locations can open, but with strict social distancing.
In phase two, gatherings can increase to 50 people and travel can resume.
In phase three, life for most Americans would return to normal as health officials identified and isolated new cases.
""One careful step at a time. Some states will be able to open up sooner than others,"" the president explained.
For hard-hit states like New York, the process will take longer.
""The bad news is 2,000 people walked into the hospital yesterday for the first time with the disease and the worst news is 600 died yesterday from the disease,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said somberly during his daily press briefing.
However, the president says states that have mostly survived the pandemic unscathed can begin taking steps to open today.
""I think 29 states are in that ball game,"" he explained.
And his plan is receiving positive feedback from governors on both sides of the aisle.
""I am an optimist. We can do this,"" said Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R). ""We must get people back to work.""

In a number of states on Thursday, including Ohio, Virginia, and Michigan, Americans protested stay-at-home orders and business closures, arguing that people at low risk for the virus should be allowed to go back to work.
""The sad irony is that they don't like being in this stay-at-home order and they may have just caused a need to lengthen it,"" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) told reporters.
And while small businesses across the country still need help, the Paycheck Protection Program, designed to keep their employees on the payroll is officially out of money after Democrats blocked Republican efforts to replenish it because they were demanding spending on other priorities as well.
""It was so popular - the banks have been incredible,"" the president said.
Along with financial concerns, medical concerns remain. Infections could go up again as states ease restrictions.
""I mean, let's face it. This is uncharted water. There may be some setbacks that we may have to pull back a little and then go forward,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
Still, for many, seeing a road forward is welcomed - a move in a positive direction during this trying time.

The administration says they will suspend the funds to the W.H.O. while they conduct a review into ""severe mismanagement"" and ""early efforts to cover up the spread of the coronavirus"".  
""The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion,"" said Trump Tuesday.
The US is the organization's leading sponsor, contributing $400-$500 hundred million every year.
""Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death, very little death and certainly very little death by comparison,"" added Trump.
Trump accused the U.N. health agency of being too trusting of China and criticized officials for opposing early travel restrictions against the country.
""The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency caused valuable time, tremendous amounts of time,"" continued Trump. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement on the White House's decision to halt WHO funding that read ""this decision is dangerous, illegal and will be swiftly challenged.""
Other world leaders like Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison agree with Trump that the WHO was slow to react. 
""I sympathize with his criticisms and I've made a few of my own,"" Morrison told 6PR Radio. ""I mean, we called this thing weeks before the WHO did. If we were relying on their advice, then I suspect we would have been suffering the same fate that many other countries currently are.""
Zhao Lijian, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman condemned the United State's decision saying the ""global epidemic is at a critical moment"" and this ""will weaken WHO's capabilities"". China, who contributes around $20 million annually to the WHO, also claims they've ""always timely notified the WHO"" to information on the coronavirus.
New reports from The Associated Press, however, show China waited six critical days in January to alert the public after determining they were facing a crisis.
During those six days, millions of Chinese people were traveling for lunar New Year celebrations, and tens of thousands of people attended a banquet at the outbreak's epicenter of Wuhan, China.

0,2020-04-15T14:30:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/april/warren-becomes-latest-ex-presidential-rival-to-back-biden,Warren Becomes Latest Ex-Presidential Rival to Back Biden,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Elizabeth Warren endorsed Joe Biden on Wednesday, the latest of the former vice president’s onetime White House rivals to back him as the Democratic Party moves to project unity against President Donald Trump going into the November election.
“Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service. He knows that a government run with integrity, competence, and heart will save lives and save livelihoods,” Warren said in a nearly four-minute video announcing her decision. “And we can’t afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American.”
The Massachusetts senator rose to brief front-runner status in the Democratic race last fall but suspended her campaign last month after a disappointing “Super Tuesday” that included a third-place finish her home state. Warren left the race without endorsing Biden or her fellow progressive Bernie Sanders — but the dynamics changed substantially in subsequent weeks, with campaigning forced into a hiatus amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Sanders dropped out last week and endorsed Biden within days, hoping to persuade his fervent progressive supporters to warm to the more centrist Biden. Former President Barack Obama followed suit on Tuesday. Warren’s formal backing doesn’t carry the political heft it might have if she had endorsed Biden over Sanders weeks ago. Nonetheless, her announcement now could fuel speculation that Biden may choose her as a running mate. Biden has said he soon will announce a committee to oversee his vice presidential search.
Warren made no mention of that possibility in announcing her endorsement video, instead saying Biden “grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class.” That phrase was a centerpiece of Warren’s own campaign and referred to her own upbringing in Oklahoma.
Warren also referred to the pandemic more directly in a tweet. “In this moment of crisis, it’s more important than ever that the next president restores Americans’ faith in good, effective government — and I’ve seen Joe Biden help our nation rebuild. Today, I’m proud to endorse @JoeBiden as President of the United States,” she said.
Some of Warren’s allies note that, in the days before her endorsement, Biden embraced some of the senator’s plans to combat the coronavirus, including calls to cancel student debt and expand Social Security benefits during the crisis. He also has adopted a plan she promoted as a candidate to overhaul the nation’s bankruptcy system.
In her video, Warren also referenced the pair’s sometimes rocky relationship. They clashed in 2005 when Biden was a Delaware senator and Warren was a Harvard Law School professor and bankruptcy expert, during a congressional hearing over a bankruptcy bill. It was a scene that Biden, as vice president, recalled when he swore Warren into office eight years later.
“Joe Biden was there at the very moment I became a Senator,” Warren said. “And when he did, he said ‘you gave me hell! And you’re gonna do a great job.’”

Trump Forms Second Task Force to Focus on US Economic Recovery,"WASHINGTON -  President Donald Trump announced a second Coronavirus Task Force Tuesday to focus on the country's economic recovery. This new group's main priority is the economy, which is weighing heavily on both the American public and the president himself.
He calls it ""the biggest decision"" he's ever had to make - when and how to reopen the country. He's hoping to roll back restrictions by May. 
""The US is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus,"" the President said during a news conference in the White House Rose Garden.

Coronavirus COVID-19 Cases Spike With 15,000 New Infections, 250 New Deaths in One Day
The latest battle to roll back restrictions.
""It's going to be very very close, maybe even before the date of May 1st,"" Trump said. 
""You're talking about re-opening parts of the country by the end of the month and if you do that, as a result, will you see a spike in cases?"" CBN News White House Correspondent Ben Kennedy asked the president. 
""We may or we may not. Some countries have and some countries haven't,"" Trump answered.  ""I'm watching other countries. I'm studying other countries as they open.""
The president said he's focused on getting Americans back to work. 
""The plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody,"" Trump said. 
And that includes faith leaders. 
""We will be talking about churches and we will be talking about opening,"" Trump said.
Several states from New York to California have already begun discussing ways to begin.  
CBN News asked Stephen Moore, an economist with The Heritage Foundation what needs to be done to reopen the economy? 
""The president will need to issue an executive order saying that certain states can open but ultimately the logistics of this will be decided by the nations' governors,""  Moore replied. 
""I will speaking to all 50 governors very shortly and I will then be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening,"" Trump said. 
Trump predicts once doors are open again, the economy will take off like a rocket. Observers warn some workers and consumers will be hesitant to return to life as it was.
""I think if the government can focus on consumer confidence with the underlying principle of the communications being the truth. Then I think demand will start to come back because ultimately this economic issue is a demand issue,"" said Dr. Andrew Root, a member of the faculty at the Regent University School of Business and Leadership. ""It's not a supply issue and demand will be a function of how well consumer confidence rebounds from what's obviously been a significant decline from cyclical highs.""
CBN News asked Moore how long he thought it will take before we're basically back to normal?
""When are we getting back to normal, that is the question we all of us want an answer to,"" he said. ""It's not going to be like an ignition switch of a car that we can just reopen the economy and everybody is going to get back to work. I wish that were the case. It's going to take in my opinion about three of four months before we have the end of this recession and it's going to be a slow recovery.""
Officials will have to be cautious. The Minneapolis Federal Reserve president warns that when restrictions have been relaxed in other countries, the virus has flared back up again. Re-opening will also be difficult for many small businesses, who employ about half of all private-sector employees. 
The CDC also says the first step to re-opening is widespread testing, which is not yet available. It will also likely be a year before a coronavirus vaccine is available.

On Tuesday, former President Barack Obama endorsed his former vice president of eight years in a 12-minute video, touting Biden as a ""close friend"" and praising his perseverance and compassion.
""Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. And I know he'll surround himself with good people,"" Obama said. 
The former president's endorsement is a big boost from the party's biggest fundraiser and one of the most popular figures among Democrats. 
Although he stayed on the sidelines during the primaries, Obama may take a more active public role in the campaign. He's expected to headline fundraisers for Biden and public events in key swing states if those events can still be held given social distancing guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic.  
Biden has frequently pointed to their time together in the White House. He often spoke of the ""Obama-Biden"" administration when talking about various accomplishments and referred to himself as an ""Obama-Biden Democrat.""
On Monday, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also endorsed the presidential bid of his formal rival. Sanders only recently dropped out of the race but had been Biden's top opponent for the chance to become the Democratic nominee.
In a joint virtual appearance Monday, Biden and Sanders acknowledged their political differences but called on Democrats, Independents, and even some Republicans to put their disputes aside for the sake of defeating President Trump in November.
That might be difficult to do financially. The president's campaign and the Republican National Committee have so far raised more than $212 million in this election year alone. 
Biden now has the support of all of his former Democratic primary rivals except for Elizabeth Warren. He also has not heard from two other prominent Democrats who have yet to endorse him: Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
The Trump 2020 campaign released a statement concerning Obama's endorsement of Biden.
""Barack Obama spent much of the last five years urging Joe Biden not to run for president out of fear that he would embarrass himself. Now that Biden is the only candidate left in the Democrat field, Obama has no other choice but to support him,"" said Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager. ""Even Bernie Sanders beat him to it. Obama was right in the first place: Biden is a bad candidate who will embarrass himself and his party. President Trump will destroy him."""

Planned Parenthood and other pro-abortion groups are asking the high court to lift Texas Governor Greg Abbott's ban on most abortions along with other non-essential surgeries.

Pro-life groups are sticking up for the restrictions in Texas.
The Justice Foundation and Operation Outcry said a joint statement:
""The fact that the abortion industry is continuing its attempt to exploit the coronavirus crisis in order to stay open is absolutely deplorable. Their callous disregard of women's health and the infant lives in the womb and others could not be more obvious.""

Before interviewing Vice President Pence on Friday, this reporter had a quick question. ""How close can we get?"" I asked as he entered the Ceremonial Office on the grounds of the White House. ""You got tested right?"" Pence asked me. I did indeed, and so, with a COVID-19 elbow bump, the interview with the vice president was on.

EXCLUSIVE: VP Pence's Message to Pastors Still Holding Church in Pews: 'Where Two or More are Gathered, There He is Also'
An hour before we sat down together, The White House Medical Unit had given me a rapid test for the virus. It came back negative but the more pressing issue: will America hear some positive news soon about getting back to normal after the April 30th guidelines are finished? 
""David, we're seeing real progress,"" the vice president told me. ""We're going to be following the data very carefully but if as some of the experts suggest if we are nearing the peak of the coronavirus and if Americans continue to do what they've been doing now for weeks across the country… we believe we'd be in a very different place come the end of April and we'll be able to bring forward recommendations.""
 
It's clear the federal government lagged on testing early mainly due to a bureaucratic process full of red tape. Pence says the model is now changing because the administration is getting the private sector more heavily involved. 
""We've developed an all-new testing format,"" Pence said. ""Abbott Laboratories has a 15-minute test. I think you just took it. We're working to make it available all across the country, but the reality was there were always many test kits out there, but the ability to process them rapidly was what the president addressed when we brought the full power of the private sector together… we're going to continue to scale and increase the amount of testing during this epidemic, but also create a foundation for a new modern rapid testing system for coronavirus and, and other diseases for years to come.""

 
While the testing is getting better, people of faith still must follow guidelines, which means no in-person church services. Most have obeyed and doors remain closed. 
""Our churches and synagogues and communities of faith across America have risen to the challenge,"" Vice President Pence tells CBN News. Still, a handful of churches are worshipping in person, a fact that Pence addresses from a biblical perspective. ""I would just remind, as a brother in Christ, that where two or more are gathered, there He is also."" Pence says it's time to push through. ""We're all making do, but we can still worship, we can still practice our faith and the really important social distancing that, at this time, in the life of our nation, is just so important.""
 
Also important, according to the vice president: giving to places of worship during this critical time. ""Even if you're not in the pew on Sunday, that ministry is still going on,"" he says. ""So to the extent that you're able to continue to contribute to your local church, your local synagogue, your ministry, we encourage you to that because those communities of faith are making such an immense difference.""
Congress is trying to make a difference too, by spending lots of money. So far, Pence likes the bipartisan cooperation. ""It really has been a testament of Congress working at its best."" The vice president says relief is on the way. ""The average family of four by this time next week will receive a direct payment of $3,400 to assist them during this time, but for small businesses around the country, we've literally enrolled thousands upon thousands of companies in the paycheck protection program, which will allow small businesses to keep people on the payroll for two months.""
 
Still, the squabbling continues. ""Look, there will be issues that will be debated in the days ahead,"" Pence acknowledges. Especially on nationwide mail-in balloting, something Democrats are pushing to get funded. Republicans say it's political. Pence isn't showing the administration's game plan quite yet. ""Well, I'd leave that to others and that will be an important debate in the days ahead… our objective right now is to put the coronavirus in the past.""
 
As the leader of the Coronavirus Task Force, Pence believes there will indeed be light at the end of this very dark and tumultuous tunnel.

Bernie Sanders days after Sanders suspended his campaign.
Biden beat Sanders Saturday 55.3% to 44.7%. A total of 19,759 votes were cast.
Biden gets 11 delegates and Sanders gets 4. Sanders would have won more delegates but after ending his bid for the nomination last week, Sanders is no longer eligible to win delegates based on the statewide vote in primaries and caucuses, according to Democratic National Committee rules. Sanders is, however, still eligible to win delegates based on vote totals in individual congressional districts, which is why the AP allocated four delegates to Sanders in Alaska.
Overall, Biden has 1,228 delegates and Sanders has 918, according to the count by The Associated Press.
Casey Steinau, chairwoman of the state party, said Sanders, along with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who also have suspended their campaigns, asked to be included in the tallies.
Sanders suspended his campaign this week but said he would keep his name on the ballot in states that haven’t yet voted. He aims to collect delegates as part of an effort to influence the party’s platform at this year’s Democratic National Convention.
Sanders won the state party’s caucuses in 2016, over Hillary Clinton.
The Alaska primary originally was scheduled for April 4, but concerns with COVID-19 upended plans. In response, the party, which had planned to offer voting by mail and at in-person locations, went exclusively to a vote-by-mail system.
The primary itself was new to Alaska Democrats, who moved from their traditional caucuses to a primary for this year’s race in a move Steinau said was aimed at increasing participation. It used rank-choice ballots.
The party said it sent in early March ballots to every person who was registered as a Democrat as of mid-February, more than 71,000. The party also included voter registration forms and downloadable ballots on its website.
Ballots had to be received by Friday to be counted, the party said.

And despite the tragic losses, now more than 16,000 Americans have lost their lives and we grieve with those who grew, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope. On this very special day, our faith gives us hope. But also, because of what the American people have been doing, heeding the President's Coronavirus guidelines for America, heeding their state and local officials. David, we're seeing real progress.

David Brody: ""You expect something to change after April 30? From a guideline perspective?""
Vice President Mike Pence: ""We're going to be following the data very carefully. But if as some of the experts suggest if we are nearing the peak of the Coronavirus and if Americans continue to do what they've been doing now, for weeks across the country, it's social distancing, avoiding gatherings of more than 10 using drive thru's at restaurants, and particularly being careful around seniors with serious underlying health conditions, by practicing hygiene and social distancing.

Vice President Mike Pence: ""I would have a message to faith communities across the country and first and foremost it would be a word of gratitude.

She had a neighbor who was bringing over some fresh groceries, it would be impossible to fully describe what faith communities, even during a time of social distancing and not even being able to meet, have still been putting hands and feet on their faith. And it's one of the reasons the President and I have taken efforts to remind every American as I do so again, that even if you're not in the pew on Sunday, that ministry is still going on.

Tim Scott's Powerful Easter Message: 'The Church Might Be Empty, But the Tomb Is Empty, Too'","Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is no stranger to obstacles. In his life, opportunities have always followed, and he believes the same will be true of the current coronavirus crisis.
“From the foundation of this nation, to this pandemic,” Scott told Faithwire, “the one place we’ve always turned when the chips were down, when everything was going to be counted, we turned to the Lord, the author and the finisher of our faith.”
The 54-year-old lawmaker believes the timing of the release of his latest book, “Opportunity Knocks,” is more than a coincidence, as it chronicles his personal faith journey through numerous adversities not unlike the calamity we’re facing today.

In his discussion with us, Scott referenced Romans 8:28 — “God works for the good of those who love Him” — which he said has been a “consistent” truth throughout his life.
He went on to say his faith in Jesus has been “strengthened” even amid this health crisis, urging Americans, particularly as Easter approaches, to be encouraged, “because I know the best for this nation is on the other side of the current pandemic.” Scott’s courage to keep trusting in God’s plan is due in no small part to the faith of his mother, whom he described as his “hero” and “best friend.”
“With this pandemic going on, I get to have lunch with her nearly every single day and I’m reminded of how strong and powerful a mother’s love is,” the senator said, adding he’s remembering to lean on “the good Lord’s love” as well.
To those struggling with fear and anxiety over the forced economic recession and the serious health risks of COVID-19, Scott pointed to 2 Timothy 1:7, which reads, “For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.”

He then offered a profound reminder as we approach Easter Sunday.
“This is a time where the church might be empty, but the tomb is empty, too,” Scott said. “This is a time when our ministry no longer resides in a specific location but, like the Great Commission, our ministry goes throughout the community, and frankly, throughout the world.”
Scott was one of the lawmakers who championed the inclusion of churches and faith-based organizations in the $2 trillion CARES Act, ensuring they have access to loans and grants, should they need it during the pandemic.
And in recent days, more data has come out showing those in the African-American community may be more susceptible to dangerous outcomes if they become infected with COVID-19. That has been particularly true in southern states like South Carolina, where Scott serves as senator.
The Republican politician, the first African-American to serve as a senator from his state, told us he has been “encouraged” by his conversations with President Donald Trump and members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. He has spoken about the issue with Dr. Deborah Birx, who serves as the task force’s response coordinator, as well as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

“The one thing that’s crystal clear is the administration’s response has been really positive,” he explained. Scott said he will be speaking this week with African-American leaders and the White House about disseminating more information to the black community “to help us understand the heightened risk we face.”
Perhaps most importantly, Scott urged federal, state, and local leaders to make “an abundance of tests available,” arguing it’s the key to reopening the economy as soon as possible. During his calls with Fauci, Birx, and Vice President Mike Pence, Scott said “the primary question” from himself and his Republican colleagues has been about pushing out a greater number of COVID-19 tests.
Scott is setting aside politics to help in other ways, too. One South Carolina business owner, Tony Bakker, is pledging to match donations up to $500,000 for the COVID-19 Relief & Recovery Fund of the Coastal Community Foundation through April 20. If the goal is reached, the fund’s total will be at least $1.5 million, all of which will go to nonprofits and churches providing medical care, food access, and financial support to those in need. Inspired by Bakker, Scott told us he has personally donated $4,000 to churches in his community — a challenge he’s passing on to his fellow members of Congress.
“One thing I’ve learned in life is there’s always a silver lining,” Scott said. “Opportunity always knocks.”
The senator’s new book is available now everywhere books are sold.

One in ten Americans is now out of work.
In California this week, a long line of people waited in the rain for food, a scene repeated in other states.
Many states are struggling to keep up with the barrage of unemployment requests.
   
""How long it takes will vary by states,"" says Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia.
In Washington Thursday, Senate Republicans pushed for another $250 billion to help small businesses who desperately need it.
""We need more funding and we need it fast,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) during a speech on the floor.
However, Democrats blocked the aid. They're demanding a $500 billion bill to offer more to health care providers and state and local governments.
""This was in fact, designed to fail, designed as a political stunt,"" argued Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) from the Senate floor.
There's now fear the unemployment rate could hit 15% soon and White House officials, eager to stave off a severe recession, say companies in certain parts of the country that are free from outbreaks could reopen in May.
However, the decision to restart the economy is largely out of the federal government's hands as many governors have issued stay-at-home orders through the end of May or later.
""We're at the top of the hill. Pretty sure we're at the top of the hill and now we're going downward. In some cases we've already started that process,"" said President Trump Thursday during his daily coronavirus briefing from the White House briefing room.
Health officials say social isolation methods are working. Dr. Anthony Fauci now predicts the American death toll will be 60,000, which is down from the earlier, more dire, predictions of 100,000 to 240,000.
""We have to be prepared that when the infections start to rear their heads again that we have in place a very aggressive and effective way to identify, isolate, contact, trace,"" Dr. Fauci told CBS News.
Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators is calling on China to immediately close all wet markets where fresh meat and produce is sold in unsanitary conditions.
This comes after the director of the Chinese CDC admitted, ""The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market.""

""I don't think it's a coincidence that this is happening at this time,"" Adams said. ""During this week we celebrate the ultimate sacrifice that was made for us. God sent his only son to die for us, and it was sad initially but then we saw salvation at the end of it.""
Adams says he understands how families struggle with social distancing. 
""I would tell them to pray for each other,"" Adams said. ""I would tell them to look for their neighbors. Social distancing doesn't have to mean social disengagement.""
Adams continues to work around the clock on the Coronavirus Task Force trying to contain the pandemic and even preparing for a possible second outbreak. 
""China has warned of a resurgence of the virus – is the US already developing a plan if a second wave of the virus could occur?"" CBN News asked the task force. 
""Yes, yes, one of the things that obviously is parallel with thinking about the possibility as I mentioned a little while ago about mitigation allowing us to turn the corner – very much on the front burner is what happens when we do,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said. ""The risk of there being a resurgence is real.""
Which is why testing now is so important. 
""There's antibody testing which is looking backward and saying 'did you have this disease sometime in the past? That's important because it allows us to put health care workers/front line workers back to work and put people in a position where they can be safe,"" Adams said. 
Adams said if you've had the diseases there is a 99 percent chance you're immune and will not get it again.

Republicans and Democrats in the Senate recessed Thursday without reaching an agreement.
It was just a couple of weeks ago that Congress passed the CARES act with strong bipartisan support.  A good portion of that measure funded the Payroll Protection Program aimed at keeping workers of small businesses employed through this crisis.  Both sides say that's not enough, but for different reasons.   
Republicans pushed to pass a bill that would send $250 billion more to the payroll protection program.  Add that to the $350 billion approved about two weeks ago and it totals $600 billion.
""The country needs us to be nimble to be able to fix urgent problems as fast as we can, to be able to have focused discussions on urgent subjects,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
""Where is the urgency where small businesses are concerned,"" said Sen. Bill Cardin (D-MD).
Cardin and other Democrats objected, saying protecting payrolls are not enough to keep small businesses from going under. They want to split the requested $250 billion to put money toward grants that would keep businesses afloat and help hospitals that are also struggling.
""The urgent issues are not dealt with in this U-C, so that's why the process of negotiating, allowing us to come together to figure out what's the best way to move forward will result in us actually getting something done to help the small business community,"" Cardin said.
Republicans disagreed saying their measure is needed to keep the payroll protection plan from running out of money.
""Do not block emergency aid you don't even oppose just because you want something more,"" McConnell said.
Democrats don't buy that the Payroll Protection Program is running out of money because only a third of it has been spent so far, and some businesses say they're struggling to access the cash.  
Republicans argue the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve are already making changes to the small-business lending program to help businesses in underserved areas.
McConnell said lawmakers need to focus on urgent subjects without turning every conversation into a conversation about everything.
The Senate is in recess until April 13.

Michigan state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D), who had been battling COVID-19, appeared on Fox News Monday night to talk about the fast-paced relief the drug gave her, telling host Laura Ingraham hydroxychloroquine saved her life.
Whitsett said she began her home quarantine on March 12 — when she started feeling unwell — and didn’t begin to feel better until she took the anti-malarial.
“It took the longest [time] for me to actually be able to get an appointment and getting with my doctor, which was the 18th of March, and then actually getting the COVID test,” she explained.

She didn’t receive the positive result from her test until March 31. And by that point, Whitsett was in bad shape.
“It went from the headaches being severe to fluid building up in my lungs, to sweats breaking out to the cough and my breathing being labored,” the lawmaker recalled. “It all happened in a matter of hours.”

When she was at the hospital, Whitsett learned her state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, had issued a statewide order banning the use of hydroxychloroquine. Though the order was rescinded a few days later, Whitsett had a difficult time getting the drug.
She was ultimately able to get the medication, though, because she has chronic Lyme disease, for which hydroxychloroquine is often used. If it wasn’t for Trump, however, Whitsett said she never would have considered the drug as a COVID-19 treatment.

“If President Trump had not talked about this, it wouldn’t have been something that would be accessible for anyone to be able to get right now,” she told Ingraham.
Within hours, Whitsett was feeling better. She told the Detroit Free Press, “It has a lot to do with the president … bringing it up. He is the only person who has the power to make it a priority.”

He has to be progressive enough to appeal to Sander's followers, but not enough to anger his base of blue-collar, middle-class, Rust Belt voters. Brody appeared on Faith Nation seen weeknights on the CBN News Channel. For a programming schedule, click here. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) dropped out of the 2020 Democratic race for President on Wednesday. 
""I wish I could give you better news. But I think you know the truth, and that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden, and the path toward victory is virtually impossible,"" Sanders told his supporters. ""So while we are winning the ideological battle and while we are winning the support of so many young people and working people throughout the country, I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful.""
Sanders quitting the race has cleared the way for Joe Biden to win the Democratic Party's nomination, which means an election showdown with President Donald Trump in November. 
""I know Bernie well,"" said Biden. ""He's a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country.""
Biden then addressed Sander's supporters saying, ""I know that I need to earn your votes. And I know that might take time. But I want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of this moment. I hope you'll join us. You're more than welcome. You're needed."" '
President Trump tweeted that if not for Elizabeth Warren, ""Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday."" 
""This ended just like the Democrats and the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hilary fiasco,"" Trump wrote. ""The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, trade.""
Sanders pushed back at Trump calling him the ""most dangerous president"" in modern American history. 
Sanders was at one point the front-runner for the nomination after winning New Hampshire's primary but then suffered major defeats on Super Tuesday to Biden. The former vice president won nine states during the March 3 primaries which revived his campaign. "

""We wanted spring training. We wanted to go to church on Easter Sunday. We wanted a weekend trip to see the spring flowers,"" he wrote.
However, as the Blue Bonnets bloom in his home state of Texas, he tells CBN News, ""This year we were slammed with a second winter.""
As he reads the prayer requests people post on his social media channels, he says it feels like grief.
""When I look in my own heart, it feels like grief,"" he revealed.
""At its core grief is an unmet expectation. We expected to have more time with our loved ones. We expected to grow old with our wife. We expected to be healthy and so when people are grieving some expectation of life has gone unmet and that's really what we're dealing with here,"" Lucado explained.

Many families are struggling to educate their children and work from home while managing the stress of an uncertain financial future and fears of poor health.
Lucado suggests people give themselves time to grieve.
""Give yourself a good meltdown - just let it go. Air your complaint before God, talk to him honestly, get on your knees, get on your belly,"" he said.
He also urges families to listen to one another since everyone processes disaster differently.
And still, as people bid farewell to the sense of safety that they've come to expect, Lucado says there is great hope.
""The Bible is a story of how God gets people through things. It's a story of deliverance,"" he noted.
""Of course, the great story is the story of Easter. How Good Friday, the darkest day of humanity, becomes the greatest Sunday of celebration because God got humanity through the crisis. The greatest coronavirus of the soul and that is sin,"" he added.
As we prepare to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus, Lucado said, he's thankful we live in a time with a technological solution to churches having to close their doors.
""What will happen is millions of people more will tune in and log in to watch an Easter service that would not have. Already in our church, and I'm hearing this from all over the country, the people watching online are two and three times the number of people who used to attend plus watch online. I know that ours is twice what it used to be,"" he told CBN News. 
He calls this a defining moment for the church.
""A time to give encouragement, a time for us to share the Gospel. A time for us to tell people that God is in control.  To remind people that yeah, this is a wakeup call for the whole planet. We've all been reminded of the brevity of life, the frailty of health. We need a God and thank God he's there,"" Lucado shared. 
""What appears to be evil, God's going to use for good,"" he said. ""We're going to get through it. Weeping may come in the night, but joy comes in the morning."""

The Republican lawmaker tested positive for the virus in March, becoming the first case of COVID-19 in the US Senate.

The junior senator from Kentucky posted a photo of himself in a tweet on Tuesday in his doctor's attire. 
""I appreciate all the best wishes I have received. I have been retested and I am negative. I have started volunteering at a local hospital to assist those in my community who are in need of medical help, including Coronavirus patients. Together we will overcome this!"" Paul wrote.
One follower answered the senator's tweet, ""Thank God! Glad you are ok. We need you!""
Another follower wrote, ""God bless you Senator Paul. You're a great statesman and patriot!""
And another user replied, ""God bless you Sir.""
The hospital's CEO, Mike Sherrod, said Tuesday that the senator is ""lifting the spirits of patients and our colleagues"" by volunteering.
""We appreciate Senator Paul and his support in recognizing our healthcare workers and providers at TriStar Greenview for their unwavering response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said in a statement.
Paul went into quarantine at home in Kentucky after learning his initial test results were positive for COVID-19 in March. 
Paul said last month that he took the initial test because of his extensive travel prior to the start of social-distancing practices and because he's at a higher risk for serious complications from the virus. The senator had part of a lung removed last year in a procedure he says stemmed from injuries he suffered when a neighbor violently attacked him and broke his ribs outside his Kentucky home in 2017.

""This is going to get worse before it gets better,"" says Dr. Anthony Fauci with the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
Jobless claims are already far worse than some expected. Nearly 10 million Americans filed for unemployment in just two weeks and those numbers may be low because states are overwhelmed with all of the new claims, so there may actually be many more people out of work.
""Everything is now marked pending so I know everybody probably is experiencing the exact same frustrations,"" says Todd Sayland, an unemployed worker trying to break through Florida's unemployment backlog.
 
And this is likely just the tip of the iceberg. Economists, Wall Street firms, and some Fed leaders expect unemployment to reach anywhere from 10 to 30 percent, along with a potentially severe recession.
However, help is on the way. As part of the $2.2 trillion dollar stimulus bill, starting today small businesses – which employ nearly half of the nation's workforce – can take advantage of the ""Paycheck Protection Act,"" which accounts for nearly $350 billion in loans.
""You get the money. You'll get it the same day. You use this to pay your workers, please bring your workers back to work if you've let them go. You have eight weeks, plus overhead,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House Thursday.
Secretary Mnuchin urges employers who've let their employees go to get a loan and hire them back.
""These loans are up to 100-percent forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers,"" explained President Trump.
Lawmakers are now pushing for another $2 trillion relief bill, this time possibly focusing on an infrastructure package designed to put people back to work while upgrading the nation's road, broadband, and water systems. 
However, with the ink barely dry on the last $2 trillion deal, reaching an agreement on another one so soon will be tough because of the sharp differences between Democrats and Republicans.

That's led to questions of whether this cracking down could endanger Americans' liberty.
The most prominent incident involves the arrest of well-known megachurch pastor Rodney Howard-Browne for holding a service at his Tampa church, defying orders from authorities in his Florida county.
 
Rights defense group Liberty Counsel has its top lawyer and founder Mat Staver representing Browne.  Staver told CBN News the pastor's church went way out of its way to make that Sunday service safe.
 
Staver stated, ""This church required a six-foot distance, required sanitizing, required the wearing of gloves and also purchased over $100,000 of special, high-grade air purification systems.""
But despite those safety measures, the pastor was still arrested this past Monday.

MORE THREATS & WARNINGS ACROSS THE NATION
In New York City, Mayor Bill De Blasio has threatened to permanently shut down churches or synagogues that continue to hold services. 
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam is threatening $2,500 fines and jail terms up to a year in jail for church's holding on-site services with more than nine people.
 
And President Trump is warning congregations against congregating.
 
He said at Wednesday's White House task force briefing, ""My biggest disappointment is that churches can't meet in a time of need.  And yet, if you do that, if you do it close, you're really giving this invisible enemy a very big advantage.""
 
Religious rights reporter Todd Starnes of ToddStarnes.com told CBN Newswatch about a frightening police presence outside an Illinois church.
 
He shared, ""We talked to a pastor in the state of Illinois. The local sheriff's department showed up and they were actually counting cars in the parking lot and they were photographing license plates of people. We had a report from Louisiana where they were told if they did not shut down their services, the National Guard would come in.""
FORCING CHURCH DOORS TO CLOSE WHILE ABORTION CLINICS STAY OPEN
Some pro-life groups are infuriated by these crackdowns at the same time as some governors are letting abortion clinics continue doing abortions when elective surgeries are supposed to be on hold during the pandemic. That's mostly so the personal protective equipment that would be used in those surgeries can go instead to those fighting the virus.
""How dare they jail pastors and close the doors of the church while the abortion industry remains open to spread the virus and put our lives at risk,"" stated Janet Porter, author of the original Heartbeat Bill – legislation that would forbid abortion after an unborn baby's heartbeat can be detected.
""While free speech and freedom of religion are being banned, Planned Parenthood continues to get away with murder,"" said Mark Harrington, head of the pro-life group Created Equal.
 
NEED A SCALPEL, NOT A CHAINSAW
Liberty Counsel's Staver insists authorities need to guard religious liberty as well as people's health, saying, ""This is a major constitutional issue that we have to balance with a scalpel, not a chainsaw when it comes to guarding public health and safety. There's a way to do both without sacrificing either.""  
 
Constitutional attorney John Whitehead is appalled at hearing reports of authorities grabbing guns and arresting people just for walking around outside.
 
Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute, told CBN's The Global Lane, ""We're seeing some places now seizing guns. You have the Los Angeles mayor now saying he's going to cut off water and power to businesses that he feels are not essential.""
ARE AMERICANS' RIGHTS ABSOLUTE OR NOT?
""I'm really concerned that when we come out of this mess that we don't come out of it less free,"" Whitehead added. ""That undermines everything the Founding Fathers gave us – which was our liberties. And what it means is you don't have absolute rights if the government can just take them away and say 'this is an emergency; we're going to take them away'.""
 
But the Heritage Foundation's Cully Stimson told CBN News governors are well within their constitutional rights if it involves going after people whose behavior could threaten the public's health.
 
US CONSTITUTION GRANTS GOVERNORS HUGE POWERS
He added, ""And I think it's those people that the governors are rightfully targeting and the police will rightfully warn, and then sternly warn, and then give a fine to, and if ultimately necessary, jail.""
Stimson also pointed out, ""Back in 1905, the Supreme Court issued a decision called Jacobson against Massachusetts which held the proposition that you could be forcibly vaccinated against your will – that for the smallpox vaccine – and that was entirely within state authority to do that. So they certainly in this context can arrest people if they violate the governor's orders.""
CHURCHES NOT SINGLED OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR BELIEFS
The Southern Baptist Convention's Russell Moore defends the authorities, writing at RussellMoore.com, ""The current situation facing us is not a case of the state overstepping its bounds, but rather seeking to carry out its legitimate God-given authority. Nowhere, at this point, have we seen churches targeted because of their beliefs or mission.""
""At issue is a clear public objective – stopping the transmission of a dangerous virus by gatherings,"" Moore went on. ""This is an area – the protection of public health – where the state has not just a legal authority but an authority granted by God himself.""
He concluded, ""Concern for public health is not a violation of religious liberty.""
 
'NOT DOING YOUR FOLKS ANY FAVORS'
Other states, though, are deciding not to use the force of law on churches. Take Ohio for instance.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told CBN News' David Brody, ""I didn't think it was proper really for government to infringe on people's First Amendment rights.""
Instead, Governor DeWine has only advised religious leaders, explaining, ""I've been candid with ministers and others. I've had conference calls with them to say, 'Look, you're not doing your folks any favors by bringing them together.'""
 
VIRUS CAN TAKE DOWN CHURCH MEMBERS, TOO
Church members certainly aren't exempt from COVID-19.  Early in March, the First Assembly of God church in Greers Ferry, Arkansas held a children's program and afterward, three visitors and 31 church members tested positive for the virus, Pastor Mark Palenske and his wife among them.
The pastor told his congregation via Facebook, ""The intensity of this virus has been underestimated by so many, and I continue to ask that each of you take it very seriously."" 
As for Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne, he announced on Twitter and Facebook his church is shutting down and going to online services. He wrote, ""I am doing this not to protect people from COVID-19 but from Tyranny.""

To say President Trump has his hands full on the coronavirus pandemic would be an understatement. So how does a president who's known for his bravado, and ""can-do"" attitude push through and take on the face of an invisible enemy like this? It starts with something Trump learned a long time ago: positive thinking. 
Everybody knows all about Donald Trump's big best selling book, The Art of the Deal. It gives insight into how he deals with the business world but to understand how he thinks and operates overall, you need to delve into the lessons he learned from his favorite pastor: Norman Vincent Peale.
The famous pastor is well known for his massive best-selling book, The Power of Positive Thinking and his messages from the pulpit reflected the same theme. 
""He (God) can make you think differently,"" Peale would tell congregants in one of his many sermons. ""No longer negatively defeated but positive, hopeful, optimistic, victorious."" 
For 52 years, Peale was pastor of Marble Collegiate church in New York City and for many of those years, Trump's parents sat in the pews listening. So did a young Donald and that's when the message of positivity began to take hold. 
Peale would often say that ""one reason that the positive thinker gets positive results is he is not afraid of a problem. As a matter of fact, he finds problems exciting. He likes to take a tough knotty problem and rip it apart and put it together again in the right manner."" That sure does sound quite a bit like Trump himself.
Indeed, with a father who preached much the same philosophy as Peale in terms of hard work and positive outcomes, Trump became sold on the idea. His father Fred actually became good friends with Peale and the pastor married Trump and his first wife Ivana.
Decades later, Trump described himself as follows to Psychology Today Magazine: ""I'm a cautious optimist but also a firm believer in the power of being positive,"" Trump said back in 1989. ""I think that helped. I refused to be sucked into negative thinking on any level, even when the indications weren't great. That was a good lesson because I emerged on a very victorious level. It's a good way to go."" 
Further cementing that view, CBN News interviewed the future president during his run for the presidency in 2015 where he made clear that Peale's impact on his life was always on the top of his mind. 
""The greatest speaker I think I've ever witnessed was Dr. Norman Vincent Peale,"" Trump told CBN News back in September 2015 on his California golf course overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
""He would speak the power of positive thinking. He would speak so much—and he'd bring it into modern-day life. He talked about success stories and people that were successful and became alcoholics, and then they conquered it…and I grew up watching that,"" he said.  
""He wasn't reading. I've heard plenty of pastors and ministers that read. It's not the same thing. Norman Vincent Peale would get up, and his arms would be flailing, and you hated to leave the church because you wanted him to go on further,"" Trump explained. "

It's not just the rising toll of human lives, the economic impact could also be catastrophic for everyone.
""Difficult days are ahead for our nation,"" Trump said at Wednesday's White House Coronavirus Taskforce briefing. ""We are going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now, that are going to be horrific.""
There were more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths in a single day Wednesday, more than double the deaths seen on any given day from the flu.

The president said the federal government is ""sending it directly to hospitals. We don't want to send it to the stockpiles because then we have to take it.""
More than 285 million Americans live in states where stay at home orders are in place.
Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi have joined at least 42 other states ordering residents to stay at home, but the president is not yet ready to issue similar, nationwide restrictions.
""There are some states that don't have much of a problem,"" Trump said.

Meanwhile, the city of Los Angeles is now recommending citizens wear face masks in public. 
In hard-hit New York City, the death toll is past 1,300 and climbing as the peak is still weeks away. A video tour of New York's Mount Sinai Queens hospital showed the hallways lined with new patients. 
Vice President Mike Pence says he expects the worst of the pandemic will be over by Memorial Day, still almost two months away.  
Officials say even with social distancing guidelines in place, up to a quarter of a million Americans could die from the pandemic, but they stress that those numbers can come down the more people comply with orders to stay inside and limit contact.
Dr. Anthony Fauci was asked how long social distancing could last. ""When it goes down to essentially no new cases, no new deaths at a period of time,"" Fauci replied.
And more evidence is emerging that coronavirus infections are being spread by people who have no clear symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says anyone exposed to the disease may be a carrier, whether that person has symptoms or not.

READ My Pillow CEO Joins Trump at White House, Calling Americans to Turn to God and the Bible
CBN News asked Drollinger if he believes the coronavirus is God's judgment on homosexuals.
""No, I do not think from the perspective of biblical exegesis that one can conclude that the coronavirus is God's judgment on homosexuals,"" he responded during an interview conducted via email.
""I make this abundantly clear in the study that the media got wrong - they reported just the opposite of what I said in my Bible study,"" he continued.
In his study, he examines the question many Evangelical pastors are asking: is America now experiencing God's judgment?
""I do not believe America is experiencing the forsaking wrath of God, but yes, America is experiencing the consequential wrath of God,"" he writes and goes on to explain.
Drollinger examines the five forms of God's judgment as stated in the Bible: eternal wrath (hell), eschatological wrath (the day of the Lord), cataclysmic wrath (the flood), forsaking wrath (removing restraint), and consequential wrath (sowing and reaping).
He mentions homosexuality in just one paragraph when listing examples of forsaking wrath. He quotes Romans 1:26-27 and writes ""indicative of forsaking wrath is a proclivity toward lesbianism and homosexuality.""
The word ""coronavirus"" is only mentioned in the footnotes of the Bible study where Drollinger makes the point that he doesn't think the virus is a form of God's cataclysmic wrath because that type of wrath is ""void of a human curative - and I think we'll soon see a human cure for the coronavirus,"" he explains.
Drollinger says falling victim to fake news is very difficult emotionally.
""One feels violated - I have never had my home robbed, but from what people tell me who have, I gather that it is a similar emotion,"" he says.
""Libelers must be held liable in order to put an end to the biases they intentionally and increasingly portend towards Evangelicals,"" he continues.
Drollinger is a high profile pastor in Washington, across the country and around the world.
As CBN News first reported in 2017, Drollinger leads weekly Bible studies with members of President Trump's cabinet.
He also pastors weekly studies with members of the House and Senate.
His Bible studies are also posted on Capitol Ministries' website.
Drollinger tells CBN News that he sought a timely topic for last week's Bible study. 
""As a careful Bible expositor, I thought I could best serve the White House Cabinet, Senate and House Members who participate in my weekly three separate Bible studies, to get out in front of this issue – and to let them know that there will be many LOONS out there who will be saying that the coronavirus is an act of God's judgment on America. So I thought it best, in my area of expertise which includes systematic theology, to outline the five forms of God's wrath as taught in and throughout Scripture.  My point was and remains that the coronavirus, after biblical analysis, could only be equated to the category of God's wrath known as sowing and reaping wrath, or better known as consequential wrath, or perhaps better known to the layman as natural law.  My point was to say that for reasons stated in the Bible study itself, that this was not a form of God's wrath of abandonment,"" Drollinger explains.

The plan boosts unemployment coverage for the millions of Americans who just lost their jobs as their employers closed down to fight the coronavirus. And most American adults who earn less than $75,000 a year are slated to receive $1,200 aid checks that could start arriving in mailboxes by the first week in April, just in time. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says the economy may already be in recession. 
The economic aid comes as the US now leads the world in more than 100,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in over 1,500 deaths. At the same time, projected numbers for the pandemic have been revised down.
That glimmer of light comes from the UK. The report from Imperial College London that predicted widespread infections along with two million deaths in the US and reportedly propelled the Trump administration to take serious steps against the virus has been revised down.

Isolation and lockdown measures have changed their projections. Dr. Deborah Birx, with the White House Coronavirus Task Force, says the model never matched the reality on the ground.
""So, when people start talking about 20% of a population getting infected it's very scary, but we don't have data that matches that based on experience,"" Birx told reporters gathered in the White House briefing room.
However, beyond the models, New Yorkers are bearing the brunt of roughly half of the cases in the US, and The Hill reports the CDC's real-world tracking is raising concerns other cities may face the same problems in the coming weeks. 
Dr. Anne Schuchat with the CDC tells The Hill, ""I think what we're seeing in New York City and New York state right now is a real warning to other areas about what may happen or what may already be starting to happen...before we ease up on the social measures that are in place.""
    
She declined to name cities likely to see major outbreaks, but there are growing concerns that New Orleans could become the next major epicenter.
Meanwhile, despite reports about shortages, Dr. Birx says ICU beds are still available in New York along with thousands of respirators.
""To wake up this morning and look at people creating DNR - do not resuscitate situations for patients. There is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion,"" Birx explains.
 
During the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence offered a word of hope to the world as the global number of cases exceeds 600,000.

Mike DeWine Took Bold, Early Action to Battle the Virus","In a one-on-one interview with CBN News, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine says the tenets of his faith have guided him through the coronavirus. DeWine is largely praised for recognizing the threat early. He says that he lives with the pressure every day of making decisions that can determine if someone lives or dies. 
While the Ohio governor doesn't dabble in prophecy, his early moves to combat the coronavirus have looked prophetic.  Before there were any known cases in the state, he shut down a big sports festival and then, after just three cases, he shut down the entire K-12 school system. DeWine gave me the inside story and more during our one-on-one interview. Below are some excerpts from the interview:
Gov. DeWine on making bold moves early on during the coronavirus:
""We made those decisions based on science, based on what the best experts could tell us who really said, 'Look, you got to have this social distancing and you've got to do it early because if you wait too long, it's too late'.""
Gov. DeWine on the challenges ahead:
""Look, we're all dealing with the same problem. We do not have enough tests. We don't have the testing capacity, but that's a nationwide problem. It's a real challenge and of course, now what we're looking for is making sure as the surge comes, this wave comes at us, we know it's coming, to make sure that we do everything we can to build out our hospitals. We think we may have to double the size of our beds, number of our beds. At the same time making sure our medical personnel have the personal protective gear that they really, really need to have. And so we've stopped all elective surgeries in Ohio, for example, we've asked dentists to do the same thing. We've even asked the veterinarians to do the same thing so we can save some of this gear for when we know we're going to really, really need it.""
Gov. DeWine on religious exemptions in Ohio's, 'Stay at Home' order:
David Brody: ""There are certain states that have exempted religious gatherings from this, 'stay at home' order, Ohio being one of them. Why did you feel the need to exempt religious gatherings exactly? What's your message to people of faith all across Ohio and really the country governor?""
Gov. DeWine: ""Well, I didn't think it was proper, really for government to infringe upon people's First Amendment rights, but we've also been quite candid with people and I've been candid with ministers and others, I've had conference calls with them and say, 'Look, you're not doing your folks any favors by bringing them together.' What I found is that churches have been very adaptable.""
Gov. DeWine on his faith and the role it has played during this crisis:
David Brody: ""Governor, you're a father of eight, a grandfather of 24. You're a devout Catholic. I'm wondering about your faith and how it informs what you're doing through this crisis and how you've relied on your faith during this crisis. Can you talk to me a little bit about that?""
Gov. DeWine: ""Sure. If there's ever a time when you need to make decisions based on what you think are the best interests of people, it's a crisis like this. And, you know, I think the essential function of government is to protect people. And so that's what my faith tells me. My faith tells me that every life is precious, whether it's the unborn, after it's born, basically from conception to natural death and so this is a matter of life and death. We're dealing with people's lives and the decisions that I make will determine to some extent, whether people are going to live or not live.""
Gov. DeWine on his approach to solving the coronavirus crisis: 
""So my attitude throughout this has been let's get the facts. I keep asking the questions. I try to find everybody or anybody who knows anything about this and try to learn from them and then base my decisions on that. The other thing I've learned throughout life is that when I don't trust my gut, when other people are going one way and I think well, I probably ought to go this way and then I end up going with them, I'm usually wrong. So I've learned to trust my gut. My instinct throughout this has been, and this is based on what the experts have told me, but my gut has been we're not moving fast enough. We've just got to move faster and so that's my message to my team every day. We've got to move faster. As John Wayne said in one of his movies, 'We're burning daylight and we're running out of time.' And we got to get this right. We've got to move quick.""

Throughout history, we have seen both good and bad examples.  But it's important to realize who truly calls the shots.
Dr. Peter Lillback and his Philadelphia-based Providence Forum work to highlight the many times and ways God has touched America and its leaders throughout its history.
Lillback told CBN News, ""God is in charge right now with the president of the United States. But not just this one – everyone before and every one after. And God is working out His will.""
'God Establishes the Boundaries & Times of Nations'
Lillback also heads up Westminster Theological Seminary. Studying and teaching how God works in history and through leaders is one of his specialties.  
""When Paul was on the Areopagus in Acts Chapter 7, he said to the Athenians, 'God establishes the boundaries and times of nations.' And so, yes, the Bible says He raises up leaders and puts them down,"" Lillback stated with assurance.

""When political leaders are raised up, God is involved in that. Now we don't know if that is for blessing or for judgment!"" Lillback said with a laugh.  ""But, absolutely, Donald Trump is leading because of God's purpose. But that's also true of Barack Obama. It's also true of George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. And, as hard as it is to say this, even the tyrants and dictators of history; God is working through all of them.""
But what to do when one of those bad leaders comes along?
'Call Them to the Higher Law of God'
""To think that God has made a mistake or God is absent? I can't say that biblically. And when we have a president we don't like, the Bible tells us we're still to respect those in authority,"" Lillback explained. ""But also call them to the higher law of God and say, 'Are you following His standards?'
If a president will follow God's standards, Lillback insisted it'll bring godly wisdom and blessing to America.
""One of the great truths that we have is God's truth and His word is His wisdom. And it's given out of His love for His creatures,"" Lillback stated. ""A lot of people say, 'Oh the Ten Commandments: God is cruel, God is mean; He's taking away my pleasure.'  It's not at all true. This is the Creator saying, 'Do you want to know the best way to live? Follow My will.'""
Give Us Leaders Who Will Bow Before the Lord
Such a follower leads his nation to seek God's will and ways.
""We ask the question, 'What's right? What's wrong?  That is the great history of America at its best,"" the seminarian said. ""And that should be our prayer: that God would restore just governance among us by people who really bow before the Lord and say 'teach me Your wisdom'.""
God is well-pleased to guide and prosper such a people. As Lillback put it, ""God's law creates the opportunity to do all that we need to do in a way that blesses all that we touch and all the people around us.""
And Lillback said of such a people dedicated to God and His ways, ""They know to do the right thing in the right way and at the right time that brings blessings to many.""
So at such a time of global crisis as mankind now faces, rather than looking to government leaders to solve all the problems, humanity would do better looking higher to the God who puts those leaders in place.

That is a record-high number of jobless claims. It quadruples the previous record which was set in 1982. It comes amid layoffs by stalled businesses during the widespread economic shutdowns because of the coronavirus, and many fear it's just the beginning.
The unemployment news comes as the US Senate has just passed a historic $2.2 trillion economic rescue package that would mean checks in the mail for Americans within weeks. 
Late Wednesday, the Senate voted 96-0 to approve the relief package which aims to help both families and businesses survive in an economy spiraling into recession. 
The president tweeted about the relief package overnight saying ""Congratulations America!"" The House is expected to vote on the bill Friday.
FOR CBN NEWS CONTINUING COVERAGE ON COVID-19, CLICK HERE. 
The legislation includes generous help for individual Americans. As it stands now, the government will send people earning $75,000 or less a $1,200 check plus $500 per child. Those earning up to $99,000 a year will get a smaller check. 
At a White House coronavirus task force briefing Wednesday night, CBN White House Correspondent Ben Kennedy asked the president about the timing of those checks.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin explained, ""Our expectation is within three weeks we will have direct payments out where we have depository information and we're looking to get a lot more information and we have procedures to do that.""
He said business loans will be available even sooner. ""And at the end of next week we want all the banks to be able to originate loans same day,"" said Mnuchin.
The president says he would like to reopen the country by April 12th -Easter - but his medical experts say that may or may not work. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top doctor on the president's coronavirus task force, has urged the public to understand that the spread of the virus is what will dictate policy. On CNN he warned, ""You gotta understand, you don't make the timeline. The virus makes the timeline."" 
The number of US deaths from the virus now tops 1,000 and with the number of cases doubling every three days, there's enormous concern about hospital capacity.
An estimated five percent of the sick need ICU beds. An Associated Press analysis of federal hospital data shows that more than 7 million people age 60 and older, who are most at risk of severe illness from the virus, live in counties without ICU beds.
One month after Mardi Gras, Louisiana has the third-highest rate per capita in the country. 
New York is still the biggest hot spot but the governor does say he's encouraged that the rate of hospitalization in the city is slowing slightly."

Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ben Sasse (R-NB) released a joint statement Wednesday afternoon claiming “unless this bill is fixed, there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work. This isn’t an abstract, philosophical point -- it’s an immediate, real-world problem.”
The current bill includes four months of bolstered unemployment benefits and increases the maximum benefit by $600. But because there is no salary cap, the senators argue some people filing for unemployment will be paid more unemployed than they were working.
“If the federal government accidentally incentivizes layoffs, we risk life-threatening shortages in sectors where doctors, nurses, and pharmacists are trying to care for the sick, and where growers and grocers, truckers and cooks are trying to get food to families' tables,” the joint statement continued. “This isn’t who we are as Americans; this isn’t what we do in a crisis.”
Senator Rick Scott (R-FL) also joined his three Republican colleagues in a press conference Wednesday to address the issue.
“Once we get this crisis behind us, we shouldn’t have policies in place that disincentivize people from returning to the workforce,” said Scott in a tweet.
Joining @LindseyGrahamSC, @SenatorTimScott, @SenSasse at 2pm to talk about a fix we MUST make to this bill before we move forward.
Once we get this crisis behind us, we shouldn’t have policies in place that disincentivize people from returning to the workforce. https://t.co/ae4AZ5zFB9
— Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) March 25, 2020
The four senators say they believe this is a drafting error and are calling for a quick fix – an amendment to cap the unemployment benefits at 100 percent of a person’s salary.
""This legislation would allow you in unemployment to make more than in employment,” said Sen. Tim Scott. “We know that this is a drafting error""
However, PBS Newshour’s Lisa Desjardins reports a Democratic aide involved in the negotiations tells her this amendment was not originally included because it is “technically going to be impossible for states to administer.”
NEW regarding the unemployment issue w/ the bill.
A Senate Dem. aide involved tells me that the reason the bill did not pay ""100%"" of income is b/c Treasury/the admin. said that was technically going to be impossible for states to administer.
B/c each has diff formula/system.
— Lisa Desjardins (@LisaDNews) March 25, 2020
The senators demands to get this fixed has sparked immediate pushback from their Democratic colleagues.
“Let's not over-complicate this,” tweeted Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT). “Several Republican Senators are holding up the bipartisan Coronavirus emergency bill because they think the bill is too good for laid off Americans.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders released a statement saying it would be an “outrage to prevent working-class Americans to receive the emergency unemployment assistance included in this legislation.”
""Unless these Republican senators drop their objection, I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund to make sure that any corporation receiving financial assistance under this legislation does not lay off workers, cut wages or benefits, ship jobs overseas or pay workers poverty wages,” continued Sanders.
Earlier today, Leader McConnell declared on the senate floor “the Senate is going to stand together, act together, and pass this historic relief today.”
But the objections raised by his four republican colleagues could stall plans to fast track the legislation through the Senate and get it passed later today."

“Today we can make all of the Washington drama fade away,” said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor Tuesday. “If we act today, what Americans will remember and what history will record is that the Senate did the right thing.”
Negotiations went into late Monday night after the second attempt to pass the bill failed earlier that day.
""We are very close to reaching a deal. Very close,” claimed Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Tuesday.
The big break in the stalemate came when Republicans agreed to include two of the Democrats top priorities in the massive plan: a “Marshall Plan” for federal hospitals which would give them an additional $5 billion on top of the $75 billion already proposed by Republicans, and stricter oversight in the $500 billion in loans designated to corporations including designating an inspector general and oversight board to oversea the distributions.
 “I don't think our Republican colleagues would want to give any administration a blank check to spend $500 billion to whoever they want, without any clear safeguards or process for accountability,” argued Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) on the Senate floor.

The bill also calls for $1200 checks to be distributed to many Americans in certain income ranges, about $350 billion in loans for small businesses to help them stay open, and $50 billion in relief to the airline industry.  
“The buzzer is sounding, the hour for bargaining as though this were business as usual, has expired,” McConnell warned on Tuesday.
In a tweet Tuesday morning, President Trump encouraged Congress to “approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has introduced a House economic stimulus plan that includes many non-starters for Republicans like a mandatory minimum wage increase for companies that receive aid and mandates for airlines to offset their carbon emissions by 2025. The House, however, is reportedly going to pass whatever bill the Senate passes and hopes to do so by unanimous consent, which would only require two lawmakers to be present on the House floor, to avoid calling the full House back to D.C."

House Democrats are getting slammed by American citizens over revelations that their massive coronavirus relief package would actually fund hundreds of millions of dollars in pet projects.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 1,100-page proposal includes $35 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.
The Democrats seem to believe that nothing can lift the American spirit during a global pandemic quite like a Broadway show choir prancing across the stage in spandex and sequins while flashing jazz hands.

But among the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic's largesse are the National Endowment of the Arts and PBS, affectionately known as Public Welfare Broadcasting System.
PBS, the home of popular programs like Sesame Street, would receive $300 million to ""prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus.""
It takes $300 million to tell a staffer to wash up before he sticks his hands in the backside of a muppet?
The National Endowment of the Arts would receive $300 million and so would the National Endowment of the Humanities. A grand total of $600 million for artists, dancers, and poetry slams.
But even that amount pales in comparison to the $500 million the Democrats want to give to the Institute of Museum and Library Services.  The money would be designated in part to purchase wi-fi access, computers and ""other internet-enabled devices.""
I'm fairly certain Comcast or Spectrum would be more than happy to provide a package deal for a fraction of that amount. And they'd probably throw in free cable and phone service, too.
Millions of people across this nation are unemployed. An untold number of small businesses are on the verge of economic collapse. Your children could go to bed hungry while Big Bird dines on filet mignon."

After heated debate on the Senate floor, lawmakers went back to negotiating with many expressing optimism they’ll get something passed early this week. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said a deal was in reach this weekend until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi returned to town Sunday morning wanting a different House bill.  McConnell criticized this as a political opportunity to pass “non-germane wish list” items.
“Democrats won’t let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal,” said McConnell on the Senate floor.
McConnell argues Democrats’ demands include new emission standards for airlines and tax credits for solar panels.
“This is not a juicy political opportunity, this is a national emergency,” continued McConnell. “This is no time for this nonsense…why does only one side understand that this is urgent?”
But Democrats maintain the bill doesn’t go far enough to help the American people.
“At the top of the list, it includes a large corporate bailout with no protections for workers and virtually no oversight,” says Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). “Also very troubling in the bill were significant shortfalls of money that our hospitals, states, cities and medical workers desperately needed.”
News Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) tested positive for COVID19 Sunday rattled senators over the weekend, with Republican Senator Jerry Moran reportedly telling colleagues he’d seen Paul at the Senate gym that morning. Paul is facing bipartisan criticism from Democrat and Republicans for continuing to go to the Capitol while awaiting test results, with GOP Sen. Martha McSally tweeting, “No one is too important to disregard guidance to self-quarantine pending test results.”
Ahead of critical votes, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) are now self-quarantining because of interactions with Paul in recent days. They join Senators Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Rick Scott (R-FL) who were already in self-quarantine after coming into contact with different individuals who tested positive for the virus.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) revealed Monday morning her husband has also tested positive for the virus and is receiving treatment at a hospital in Virginia.
“We love him very much and pray for his recovery. He is exhausted and sick but a very strong and resilient person,” said Klobuchar in a statement on Medium. “I wanted to let my colleagues and constituents know that since John and I have been in different places for the last two weeks and I am outside the 14-day period for getting sick, my doctor has advised me to not get a test. As everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don’t qualify to get one under any standard.”
As the virus continues to hit close to home for more and more lawmakers, Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Rob Portman (R-OH) are leading the bipartisan push for the Senate to vote remotely.
“If we cannot be here, we still need to be able to do it remotely. With the technology we now have, we have the ability to do that,” said Portman on the Senate floor.
McConnell is likely to send senators home once an agreement is reached and the legislation passes. As the House prepares to take up the bill – it’s unclear right now if Speaker Pelosi will call the members back to DC or allow for remote voting.

The government is now taking massive action even as there's been a surprising twist for victims of the virus.
Capitol Hill is not immune to COVID-19. Out of the thousands of US patients with the virus, two are members of Congress. Florida Rep. Mario Diaz Balart, 58, and Utah Rep. Ben McAdams, 45, released statements Wednesday night saying they've tested positive.

This comes as President Trump signed a coronavirus aid package Wednesday night, providing free testing and two-week paid sick leave for full-time workers who come down with the virus. ""We are all in this together, and we will come through together. It's the invisible enemy,"" he said.
The next step in the president's economic plan is to put money straight into the hands of the American people. Trump is pushing Congress to approve a trillion-dollar-plus economic recovery package. It could include $500 billion in direct payments to Americans, $300 billion for small businesses, and $50 billion for the hard-hit airline industry.
But will it all be enough? Economist Stephen Moore tells CBN News the economy will recover. ""We’ve lived through these crises before,"" Moore said, saying there could be a short recession but ""then the economy will boom out.""
Meanwhile, a federal government plan to combat COVID-19 warns of a worst-case scenario in which the pandemic could possibly ""last 18 months or longer."" It also predicts widespread shortages that would strain the nation's health care system. 
Trump said America is at war with the disease, saying, ""I view it as, in a sense, a wartime president.""
The president has now invoked a wartime law, the Defense Production Act, allowing him to direct American industries to produce critically needed medical equipment and protective gear.
The shut-down has been taking a big toll on investors who fear a recession. Stocks tumbled again on Wednesday, and oil dropped below $21 per barrel for the first time since 2002. In the latest round of shutdowns: the largest owner of shopping malls in the nation, the Simon Property Group, is closing the doors of all its malls and retail properties. Ford, General Motors and Chrysler-Fiat are also closing all of their factories in the US, Canada, and Mexico, sending 150,000 workers home.
Christian leaders continue to issue calls to prayer. ""These issues are bigger than we can handle ourselves, we need divine direction and divine intervention,"" said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. 
Meanwhile, some hope and the good news are coming in from Wuhan, China, the initial epicenter of the virus. Chinese authorities, said Thursday, that the city and its surrounding provinces had no new cases to report for the first time in many weeks.

However, suppression of religious activities can be alarming in countries where freedom of worship is already a struggle.
As countries limit religious activities and close major religious sites in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19, religious liberty advocates say governments have an obligation to consider religious freedom.
International law ensures everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.
""So it's not a derogated right, which means it doesn't disappear during war or even public emergencies so even now during this time people still have the right to practice their religion,"" says Commissioner Nadine Maenza with the US Commission on International Freedom (USCIRF) during an interview with CBN News.
She says an exception is what we're seeing play out now where religious services and activities for all faiths are being curtailed, however, she says USCIRF is watching closely to make sure countries aren't using the pandemic as an excuse to single out religious minorities.
""Faith communities can be really good partners to governments during these times and we really recommend that rather than curtailing religious rights that states will work with religious communities on really having a more positive outcome,"" the commissioner said.
During times of international crisis, Maenza says violations against religious minorities can be exacerbated. She points to China where Uigur Muslims have been held in concentration camps for years and are currently being used to fill gaps in the factory labor force that was wiped out by COVID-19.
""We've even heard reports of lung transplants being available within a few hours. We would expect from their record to be using religious prisoners of conscience,"" she says painting a chilling picture.
USCIRF's annual report on religious freedom around the world is scheduled to be released next month."

But this apparently was unacceptable to Muslim Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who chose to retweet Parkland High School shooting survivor and gun control advocate David Hogg's tweet.
Hogg wrote: ""Don't let this administration address COVID-19 like our national gun violence epidemic. F*** a National day of prayer, we need immediate comprehensive action.""
Brandon Morse in an article for RedState.com wrote his reaction to Tlaib's tweet.
""It's one thing for a lawmaker to wish for action other than prayer. It's another to insult millions of Americans who do pray and believe the action to be effective with a complete curse-laden dismissal of the action. Tlaib has proven herself to be an elected official completely dismissive of American traditions,"" Morse wrote. 
This is not the first time the foul-mouthed congresswoman has used the F-bomb in public. As CBN News reported in January of 2019, as a newly elected Islamic member of Congress, she wasted no time telling the world her plans in an obscenity-laced tirade.
Tlaib came to Congress dressed in traditional Palestinian clothing. She blasted Trump while speaking to MoveOn.org, explaining how she cursed the president in front of her own son.
""And when your son looks at you and says, 'Mama look, you won. Bullies don't win,' and I said, 'Baby, they don't,' because we're gonna go in there and we're going to impeach the motherf-----!"" Tlaib said.
And she was completely unapologetic about using that particularly obscene phrase in public, tweeting:
""I will always speak truth to power. #unapologeticallyMe,"" she wrote in a tweet dated Jan.4, 2019.
Tlaib is no stranger to controversy.  As CBN News reported last summer, a video surfaced showing Tlaib yelling, flailing, and disrupting a Trump rally in 2016 before she became a US congresswoman. 
The video shows her being escorted out of the event by the Secret Service. "

The president acknowledged the impact on the economy is serious, saying the US ""may be"" heading for a recession, but he urged people to stay calm.
In the daily briefing about the COVID-19 coronavirus, health officials issued new guidelines. 
The Outer Banks in North Carolina announced Tuesday that a restriction on tourists and visitors has been put in place to reduce spreading of the coronavirus. 
""In response to updated guidelines from the CDC to avoid discretionary travel and follow The President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America, the Dare County Control Group has made the decision to restrict visitor access to Dare County beginning today, Tuesday, March 17.""
The president said gatherings should now be limited to 10 people for the next eight weeks out of an abundance of caution.
""We've made the decision to toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now recommending all Americans work to engage in schooling from home, gathering in groups of no more than 10, avoid travel and eating and drinking in restaurants and public food courts,"" he said.

 
""If everyone makes these changes now we will defeat and have a big celebration altogether,"" he said, pointing out that a new vaccine clinical trial has just begun as scientists race to develop antiviral therapies.
And at the White House there are new measures to protect the president and his staff, including taking the temperature of anyone who enters the complex.
Drive-Through Testing
Meanwhile, drive-thru testing for COVID-19 took place at hospitals across America Monday. 
Paul Gaden with Sentara Princess Anne Hospital in Virginia Beach, Virginia, is encouraging people to remain calm.  
He says America's hospitals are prepared to take care of those at high risk, like the elderly and those whose immune systems are compromised.

""Albeit, there is not a treatment for COVID-19, it is other culpabilities that actually are what become dangerous for those patients. For those that are younger, that contract COVID-19, they're gonna be fine and they'll be able to manage and be able to get on the mend after 14 to 16 days.""
Gaden says the virus is more contagious so testing like this is important.
Patients go through a verbal triage first. They're asked if they have symptoms like shortness of breath, cough and a fever above 100.4, or have traveled internationally or here in the US where there are outbreaks.
""They will be tested... and should self-quarantine,"" he said.

As the two debated in a near-empty room standing six feet apart, both tried to show they were the best to lead the US through the pandemic. 
Biden promised to deploy the US military to help with recovery efforts and warned a federal bailout may be necessary to stabilize the economy.
Sanders said his government health insurance plan would let the country respond faster to a health crisis.
And the former vice president made an unexpected announcement when he vowed to appoint a woman as vice president.

When questioned on the same topic, Sanders echoed a similar response, ""In all likelihood, I will. It is about making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there - so my very strong tendencies would be to move in that direction.""
Both presidential hopefuls confirmed that rallies and events have been canceled, pointing out how they are protecting themselves from the coronavirus.
""I'm not shaking hands. Joe and I did not shake hands. I'm using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection,"" Sanders said.
Biden made it clear that he is taking similar protective measures.
""I wash my hands. God knows how many times a day. I carry with me, in my bag outside here, hand sanitizer,"" Biden said. ""I don't know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don't touch my face and so on. I'm taking all the precautions we're telling everybody else to take.""
Each candidate tried to score some political points too by condemning President Trump's handling of the coronavirus.
Biden remarked on how Trump has managed testing, but Sanders specifically charged the president with undermining experts.
""He's undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people,"" Sanders claimed. ""It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering un-factual information.""

Biden mentioned expanded testing while Sanders turned to his theme of Medicare for All. He stressed to Americans that, ""when you get sick, if you have the virus, that will be paid for,"" Sanders said. ""If you lose your job, you will be made whole, you're not going to lose your income.""
President Trump and members of Congress are already trying to take care of those things too, including free virus testing and assistance for hourly workers.
Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel reacted to both candidates' criticism toward President Trump.
""President Trump is working around the clock and taking decisive, aggressive action to prioritize the health and safety of the American people. It is because of this strong leadership that President Trump, not whichever socialist the Democrats eventually nominate, will win re-election in November,"" McDaniel said in a statement."

The White House released the test results Saturday night after Trump told reporters hours earlier that he had taken the coronavirus test, following days of resisting being screened despite the fact that he had been in recent contact with three people who have tested positive for the virus.
Trump told reporters at a White House briefing on Saturday that he had his temperature taken and it was “totally normal,” shortly before stepping into the room to discuss the government’s efforts to halt the spread of the virus. The pandemic has now infected more than 2,200 people in the U.S. and caused at least 50 deaths.
The president had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have since tested positive for the virus, including three people he spent time with last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said late Friday that the country’s chargé d’affaires, Nestor Forster, tested positive after sitting at Trump’s dinner table. So, too, have a top aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who took a photo with Trump and attended a party with him, and another person who attended a campaign fundraiser with the president that Sunday, according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters.
Trump, after days of insisting that he was not exhibiting symptoms of the virus, relented after being pressed by reporters about his resistance to testing when multiple lawmakers and countless citizens across the country who have had the same degree of exposure have not only tried to get tested, but also chosen to try to avoid potentially infecting others.

In an exclusive story, The Daily Caller reports several officials allege that while Pelosi was negotiating the stimulus package with US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, she tried to lobby for ""several"" provisions which stalled bipartisan guarantees to the measure. 
The officials said on Thursday that the House Speaker tried to include a directive that would have created a $1 billion ""slush fund."" 
""A new mandatory funding stream that does not have Hyde protections would be unprecedented,"" one White House official told The Daily Caller. ""Under the guise of protecting people, Speaker Pelosi is working to make sure taxpayer dollars are spent covering abortion — which is not only backwards but goes against historical norms.""
The Hyde Amendment blocks all government funding from supporting abortions except in instances of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. Congress passed the amendment in 1976.
Another White House official asked ""what the Hyde Amendment and abortion have to do with protecting Americans from coronavirus?"" according to The Daily Caller. 
Even though President Trump signaled he would sign any stimulus bill offered by Congress, several Republicans disapproved of the bill negotiated by Pelosi and Mnuchin.
Trump said on Thursday he did not support the measure as it stood. 
""No, there are things in there that had nothing to do of what we are talking about. It is not a way for them to get some of the goodies they have been able to get for the last 25 years,"" Trump said, without offering specifics."

It turns out a Justice Department investigation found that an application for a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign aide contained misinformation. 
Congress created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to fight terrorism. It was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in 1978.
Lawmakers are making several revisions before renewing the law, including stronger congressional oversight in the FISA process, and punishing those who abuse the FISA court. 
The measure is trying to address several concerns of members of both parties. It mandates that the attorney general must approve in writing of an investigation if the target of electronic surveillance or a physical search is an elected federal official or a candidate. That provision is in line with a policy Attorney General William Barr has instituted in the Justice Department.
The revised bill would also scale back some current authorities, such as the government's access to certain records. It would also attempt to put stronger checks on some surveillance measures and make the process more transparent. 
It gives an oversight board the power to thoroughly examine the impact of FISA jurisdictions and powers on First Amendment activities and the extent to which decisions are made on the basis of race, religion, and ethnicity.
The bill is also intended to strengthen the accuracy of the applications that the Justice Department submits to the FISA court when it asks to eavesdrop on conversations of people in the US that it believes are agents of a foreign power. 
The current provisions of the act expire Sunday.  The measure could come to a floor vote before lawmakers leave Washington at the end of the week. 
It is not clear if the Senate would support the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has supported renewing the act, but his office did not have an immediate comment on the draft released by the House."

But what exactly does it mean? And how does it compare to the socialism we've seen throughout history?
Socialism is a system where the government controls production and how goods are distributed to the people.
Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders describes his brand of Democratic Socialism as a continuation of what President Franklin D. Roosevelt worked to achieve during his time in office. 
Here's how Sen. Sanders (I-VT) described it during a town hall on CNN. ""Having in a civilized society the understanding that we can make sure that all of our people live in security and in dignity. Healthcare is a human right, all people should have healthcare. You can't get ahead in this country, in this world, unless you have a decent education.""
While the Democratic Socialists of America declined CBN's request for an interview, many Democrats say they have a cleared-eyed understanding of what Sanders wants to achieve.
 
""I understand it as an ideal, idealized or aspiration form of socialism where you have that same government system of control, but the government should be democratically elected so it's a softer form of socialism, but there's an inherent contradiction there,"" explains Ryan Pougiales, senior political analyst with Third Way during an interview with CBN News.
""Socialism itself is defined by control, control by the state over the economy and who gets what, but then the democratic element butts up against it because democracy is meant to be about freedom,"" Pougiales says.
Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank, has been critical of Sanders. 
""We're deeply concerned about his politics, specifically the specter of Democratic Socialism which hangs over everything he does,"" Pougiales says.
Sanders says Democratic Socialism offers economic equality, but Joel Griffith with The Heritage Foundation says his trillion dollar programs will be a burden on middle class Americans.
 
""If you look at France for instance, it's a partially socialized economy. Their payroll tax is at 54%. That's the type of tax burden we're talking about here in the United States if we want to actually enact those left-leaning, radically progressive policies,"" Griffith tells CBN News.
Also, many Democrats have grave concerns about Sanders' impact on congressional candidates on the ballot this year.
""We want to see somebody on the ticket that will allow us to expand our numbers, not having to run some kind of a rear guard campaign in order to keep from being tarnished with a label,"" Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) said during a recent interview on CNN.
Some GOP candidates took advantage of Sanders' front-runner status to label their Democratic opponents ""Bernie Bros.""
""If Sanders is the nominee in 2020 they'll be stuck with the Sanders agenda rather than being able to run on those kind of common sense, kitchen table suite of issues that won them their elections in 2018,"" Pougiales explains.
Still, the idea of socialism as an alternative to capitalism in the US is expected to stick around beyond Bernie Sanders.
That's because polling shows young adults ages 18 to 34 tend to like it.

While visiting an auto assembly plant, Biden and an auto worker got into a heated discussion over guns, The Wall Street Journal reports.
The worker told Biden he was ""actively trying to take away our Second Amendment right and take away our guns.""
""You're full of s***,"" Biden said to the worker.
 
A press wrangler attempted to intervene but was quieted by the former vice president.
""I support the Second Amendment, just like right now if you yelled 'fire', that's not free speech,"" Biden said. ""From the very beginning, I had a shotgun, I had a twenty gauge, twelve gauge. I am not taking your gun away at all. Do you need 100 rounds? No.""
The worker repeated the charge, ""You're going to take our guns,"" but Biden pushed back. ""I did not say that! I did not!""
Biden has suffered a series of recent blunders, including a failed attempt to recite the Declaration of Independence during a campaign speech in Texas. The video of that mistake has gone viral.
""We hold these truths to be self-evident,"" Biden said. ""All men and women are created, by the, you know the, you know the thing.""  
Millions of people have watched the gaffe on Twitter:
And Biden called a 21-year-old college student a ""lying dog-faced pony soldier"" during a campaign stop in New Hampshire last month.
It happened when Madison Moore asked Biden if voters should remain confident in his abilities after he suffered a weak performance in the Iowa caucuses. 
Biden asked the student if she had ever been to a caucus. When Moore said she had, that's when Biden boldly called her a liar.
Moore told the Macon Telegraph that the joke was ""kind of insulting."" 
""It was kind of humiliating to be called a liar on national TV by the former vice president,"" Moore said. ""Instead of answering that question straightforward, his immediate response was to attempt to invalidate me by exposing my inexperience.""
To be fair, candidates across the spectrum have had plenty of verbal gaffes during election seasons, and President Trump has come under fire for comments he's made in recent years as well.
Despite Biden's blunders, he leads Bernie Sanders in the Democratic delegate race with 823 to Sanders' 663 and he's already talking about how he will campaign against President Trump in the general election.  "

(AP) — Bernie Sanders captured North Dakota’s caucuses Wednesday, a repeat victory in a state he won four years ago but the smallest of prizes after a night where rival Joe Biden captured much bigger states elsewhere.
The state Democratic Party expected a big turnout surge for revamped caucuses and they got it — so much that the party had to put out an urgent call for volunteers to add staff at its largest site in Fargo, and wound up holding that site and Grand Forks’ open an extra hour and delaying the party’s reporting of results.
When results from Fargo were finally tallied Wednesday, Sanders had a thumping victory, with roughly 53% of the vote to Biden’s 40%. But the state offered just 14 pledged delegates.
Heather Davin, 20, a student at North Dakota State University, was among those who endured a long wait in Fargo before she finally was able to cast her ballot for Sanders, whom she said “has the most gumption in what he is talking about.”
In Bismarck, Nicole Schumaker also backed Sanders, telling the Bismarck Tribune she saw him as having “the best shot” at unseating Trump.
After polls closed in Michigan, the Sanders campaign complained of long waits to vote in that state “and around the country.”
But in Fargo, North Dakota State professor Bob Pieri said Democrats should be proud of the turnout in North Dakota, a state that Donald Trump carried in 2016 by a bigger margin than any except West Virginia.
“I think that’s good news for Bernie. I don’t know what he’s complaining about,” Pieri, the last person in line in Fargo, said. “To me what that says is there are a lot of people who want to get involved.”
Linda Day, 80, of Fargo, is a self-described progressive who said she likes the idea of a single payer healthcare system. But she was going for Biden.
“He is my man,” Day said. “Trump is very much afraid of Biden.”
At midday, voters waited in line outside a union hall in the state’s largest and most liberal city while party leaders scrambled to handle the unexpected crowd. Traffic and lines only grew during the post-workday crush, cars waiting to turn into the parking lot or searching for a place to park on the street. Five propane heaters were set up to keep people warm in the 31-degree weather, and volunteers served coffee.
For the most part, the mood was light: One man set up a pair of small but powerful speakers on a picnic table and blasted rock music. And one voter who exited the building ran through the crowd holding up his cell phone and yelling, “You’re close!′
Rick Gion, 40, a longtime North Dakota Democrat, said he got an “all hands on deck” call from the state party chair at midday asking for volunteers to help with the Fargo caucus. Gion spent much of his time helping handicapped people, families with babies and other people who may not have dressed for the occasion get moved inside.
“People are so excited about getting President Trump out of office,” Gion said. “The lines are long and people are being so patient.”
North Dakota shifted this year from traditional caucuses to so-called “firehouse caucuses” that work much like typical elections, with voters able to show up, cast a ballot and leave. The parties run the process, and Democrats had 14 locations statewide open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., with a mail-in option as well. About 250 people were still in line at Fargo when the scheduled 7 p.m. closing time hit; those people were allowed to vote and finished by about 8 p.m. Party spokesman Alex Rohr said voters in Grand Forks — home to the University of North Dakota — also weren’t complete until about the same time.
With much larger prizes at stake elsewhere, neither candidate did much in the state. President Donald Trump was unopposed in the GOP’s caucuses.
Sanders won North Dakota just four years ago, clobbering Hillary Clinton in the traditional format that rewards highly organized campaigns with fervent followers willing to invest the time necessary to see the process through.
The limited locations and the eight-hour window for voting — less time than a traditional election and with no ability for people to vote before work — meant increased pressure on the caucus sites. Party spokesman Alex Rohr said both were based on the party’s “volunteer force.” He pointed out that the party gave voters a mail-in option for people who didn’t want to or couldn’t travel significant distances to vote, or otherwise had problems.
Just 3,400 people took part in Democrats’ 2016 caucuses; on Tuesday, participation more than quadrupled to more than 14,000.
Connor Marchus, 20, another Sanders supporter who attends North Dakota State, liked the revamped caucus format.
“It’s a slight inconvenience but overall when you look at the bigger picture, it’s great to have this many people vote,” he said.

Trump's incoming Chief of Staff Mark Meadows along with several members of Congress who have had contact with President Trump are now self-quarantined after they interacted with an infected person who attended the CPAC conference outside DC a week and a half ago.
This raised questions if the president himself is at risk.

The former vice president's victory there, as well as Missouri, Mississippi, and Idaho dealt a serious blow to Sanders, who is urgently seeking to jump-start his flagging campaign.
""This campaign is taking off and I believe we're gonna do well from this point on,"" Biden announced.
Sanders did win North Dakota and is still waiting for results from Washington State.  
But Biden's wins in Mississippi, Missouri, and Michigan again showed his strength with working-class voters and African Americans, who are vital to winning the Democratic nomination. 
Both men had focused intensely on Michigan. That's where Sanders scored an upset that lent much-needed credibility to his 2016 primary challenge of Hillary Clinton - and where President Donald Trump's victory four years was so narrow that Democrats are desperate to show they have the strength to flip it back. Biden made a final push there in recent days, rallying autoworkers and touting a fresh round of high-profile endorsements.
On Tuesday evening, Biden and Sanders canceled campaign events scheduled in Cleveland, Ohio, amid coronavirus concerns. Their decision to cancel events in Ohio, which votes next week and awards 136 delegates, suggests the coronavirus could upend the Democratic primary at a pivotal time in the race for both candidates. Sanders is trying to regain some momentum in the latest round of voting Tuesday night, while the former vice president is looking to further pad his delegate lead.
Both candidates scored major endorsements in recent days, including Civil Rights leader Jesse Jackson for Sanders and Senators Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) for Biden.
The two candidates have recently been battling over Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" proposal as the coronavirus dominates the headlines.
""Think about the insanity of a system where, today, somebody wakes up and maybe they think they have the symptoms of coronavirus, yet they cannot afford to go to a doctor,"" Sanders said.

Sanders tweeted, ""It is one of the honors of my life to be supported by Rev. Jesse Jackson, a hero to me who has put his life on the line for 50 years fighting for justice. Together, we can, we must and we will defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country.""

0,2020-03-07T07:00:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/march/trump-names-rep-mark-meadows-his-new-chief-of-staff,Trump Names Rep. Mark Meadows his new Chief of Staff,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the midst of one of the most daunting crises of his administration, President Donald Trump announced he had made a major staff overhaul, replacing his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney with Republican Rep. Mark Meadows.
While much of the country was focused on the spreading coronavirus, Trump announced the surprise reshuffle by Friday night tweet, saying Mulvaney would become the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.
“I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” he wrote, thanking Mulvaney — who never shook his “acting” title — “for having served the Administration so well.”
The long-rumored move comes as Trump has been pulling together a team of loyalists and allies ahead of what is expected to be a bitter reelection fight. But the timing — as his administration was already facing criticism over its handling of the outbreak — threatened to exacerbate concerns about the government’s ability to protect the nation from a virus that has now infected more than 100,000 people worldwide. Meadows will be Trump’s fourth chief of staff in as many years.
Mulvaney had been leading the administration’s interagency response to the virus until Trump designated Vice President Mike Pence to lead the whole-of-government effort more than a week ago.
It was just one of a long series of downgrades for Mulvaney, whose relationship with Trump began to sour not long after he was named to the position in December 2018. Indeed, Trump had been eyeing the change for many months, according to people familiar with his thinking, but wanted to wait until after the impeachment saga was over to make his move.
Meadows, the onetime leader of the House Freedom Caucus, is a longtime Trump confidant and sounding board, whose political instincts Trump respects. He announced last year that he would not be seeking reelection for his North Carolina House seat, and said he expected to join Trump’s team in some capacity, though it was not clear in what role.
He was officially offered the job Thursday, according to one of the people familiar with the matter, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the changes publicly. Mulvaney was informed Friday.
Some outside advisers had cautioned Trump that making such a high-profile switch during the coronavirus crisis would rattle markets craving stability, and his decision to make the announcement after Wall Street had closed Friday was partly informed by those concerns, the people said.
First elected in the post-Tea Party wave of 2012, Meadows quickly established himself as a leader of a new generation of conservative Republicans on Capitol Hill. He served as chairman of the unyielding Freedom Caucus, and his antics in the House helped spur Speaker John Boehner’s sudden retirement.
As Trump ascended in 2016, Meadows switched from his earlier backing of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and — urged on by his wife — joined the Trump train. Since then he has proven himself an unwavering Trump ally.
A skilled negotiator, Meadows is seen as both a leader and an outlier among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Meadows was central to talks on the failed effort to repeal Obamacare and pass the GOP tax cuts. But in many ways, he remains his own counsel, with a skill set and status that may serve him well in Trump’s White House.
Meadows has also made clear to the White House and those close to the president that he has no plans to try to rein in Trump, as others — like Mulvaney’s predecessor, retired four-star Gen. John Kelly — have tried and failed to do.
Having seen how Kelly’s efforts to impose military order had grated on Trump and antagonized outside allies, Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina, took a laissez-faire approach, making clear he believed his job was to manage the staff and not the president.
He adopted the “Let Trump be Trump” mantra that had served others in Trump’s orbit well and focused instead on trying to boost staff morale and wooing lawmakers at the Camp David presidential retreat. But while he never irritated Trump and outside allies, Mulvaney had been relegated to the sidelines even before a disastrous mid-October press conference in which he insisted quid pro quo was normal when it came to foreign policy, undercutting the president’s position that there was no such thing in his dealings with Ukraine.
Still, his allies had repeatedly brushed off rumblings of his imminent departure and had said as recently as last month that he planned to stay at least through the election in November.
Trump had other plans. Ever since he was acquitted by the Senate on the impeachment charges, Trump has been on a tear to rid his administration of those he deems insufficiently loyal. And he has been assembling a team of trusted confidants as he prepares for a tough reelection fight.
Still, one person close to Mulvaney insisted he was pleased with the decision to bring in Meadows, noting the two were friends and had served together on the Freedom Caucus. Indeed, they said Mulvaney had raised the idea of Meadows as chief of staff before Trump had tapped Mulaney for the job, and said he discussed the plan with Trump following his trip to India last week.

The Associated Press has allocated more than 92% of the 1,344 delegates that were up for grabs on Tuesday, and Biden has such a commanding lead that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders cannot catch up as the remaining votes from that day’s 14 state primaries are counted.
Biden built his delegate lead on Tuesday by racking up huge victories in Alabama, North Carolina, and Virginia while scoring a narrow win in Texas. In all, Biden won 10 states and Sanders won four.
“Look, not long ago the press and the pundits declared this campaign dead, but this week we saw tremendous support across the nation,” Biden told supporters by phone Friday evening. “We changed the whole narrative.”
Sanders won California and three other states — Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont. Although Sanders won the biggest state, California, he didn’t rack up the commanding lead required to surpass Biden’s haul.
Biden has won at least 610 delegates from Tuesday’s contests, while Sanders has won at least 513, according to the AP delegate count. There are 102 delegates still to be allocated.
Most of the delegates still not allocated are in California, with the next biggest chunks in Colorado and Utah. Despite Sanders winning all three states, he has already been awarded the largest share of delegates in those states.
Many of the delegates are being withheld because it is unclear whether former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg will finish above the 15% threshold in California, which would score him a significant number of statewide delegates. Regardless of whether Bloomberg reaches the threshold, Sanders can’t catch Biden because many of the remaining delegates would then go to Biden.
Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race on Wednesday.
Overall, Biden has 664 delegates to Sanders’ 573. Sanders started the week with a six-delegate lead. Biden’s performance was all the more remarkable considering his slow start in the first three contests. Less than a month ago, Biden didn’t win a single delegate in New Hampshire.
The contest could now become a drawn-out two-man battle for delegates to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in July. It takes a majority of pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses — 1,991 — to win the nomination on the first ballot. With only two viable candidates left in the race, the prospect of a contested convention is remote.
The race now enters a key stretch as voters in 10 states cast ballots over the next two weeks. Sanders scrapped an appearance in Mississippi to campaign in Michigan — the largest prize on Tuesday when six states representing 352 delegates vote. Sanders’ move was an acknowledgment that he stands little chance of blunting Biden’s edge with black voters in the South and must focus on fighting back in the Midwest.
Four states vote on March 17, including delegate-rich Illinois, Ohio, and Florida, where Sanders could struggle because of the state’s older electorate and his recent praise of Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
When Sanders ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Clinton won in Florida, Illinois, and Ohio — the three states with the most delegates at stake in the mid-March primaries. In Florida, the biggest prize of the next two weeks, Clinton nearly doubled Sanders’ vote.

The Coronavirus is a major concern to millions of people worldwide but apparently, to some on Twitter, a prayer to God from Vice President Pence about the deadly virus is also a concern. Recently, Pence opened up an administration task force meeting with a prayer and the photo went semi-viral as many on Twitter had quite a few unkind words to say about it. Clearly, in today's divisive and toxic culture, not even a simple prayer is off-limits to criticism, especially when it comes from Vice President Pence, a man who takes his Christian faith very seriously.
 
Thomas Chatterton Williams, a writer for New York Magazine and Harper's Magazine tweeted about the photo and it took off like wildfire. He tweeted the following: ""Mike Pence and his coronavirus emergency team praying for a solution. We are so screwed."" A tweet by Playboy White House Correspondent Brian Karem chimed in with this: ""Clear that @vp and @realdonaldtrump are in over their heads. POTUS is literally praying for a miracle to make coronavirus go away."" Thousands of others followed with snarky tweets of their own.
 
As Christians, we know that prayer is an act of surrender. We pray because we realize that we don't have answers to all of life's questions and we need God's guidance. Mike Pence is clearly praying to God for wisdom regarding how the government should combat the coronavirus and that should not be controversial. In May 2018, I spoke to the vice president about how this White House is constantly on its knees in prayer. ""There's prayer going on on a regular basis in this White House,"" Pence told me. ""It's one of the most meaningful things to me, whether it's public meetings or not.""
 
It should come as no surprise that past administrations relied on prayer frequently during a crisis. Take, for example, President Bill Clinton. In the mid-1990s, as America was preparing to invade Haiti, Clinton's speechwriter wrote a line, that said, ""no president makes decisions like this one without deep thought."" But Clinton said something was missing. He added the word prayer so it read, ""thoughts and prayers.""
 
During the brutal and bloody US Civil War, Abraham Lincoln could only look to God saying, ""I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day.""
 
President John F. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, was known to head straight to St. Matthew's Cathedral across the street from the White House for prayer during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
 
Of course, we can't leave out President Jimmy Carter. The Southern Baptist Sunday School Teacher talked extensively about praying for wisdom when trying to break an impasse between Anwar Sadat, a Muslim, and Menachem Begin, a Jew, at the famous Camp David Peace Accords.
 
President Gerald Ford turned to the Bible too.  As Richard Nixon's resignation was nearing and Ford was about to become president, he and his son began reading from Proverbs 3:5-6, where it talks about trusting in the Lord with all your heart and leaning not on your own understanding.
 
Clearly, Mike Pence's prayer is not unusual in any way, shape or form. As a matter of fact, praying for God's guidance in a crisis, is actually as American as it gets.

'Dangerous': Chief Justice Roberts and Trump Rebuke Schumer for Threatening Gorsuch and Kavanaugh
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took Schumer to the woodshed Thursday on the floor of the Senate.
""There is nothing to call this except a 'threat',"" McConnell said. ""And there is absolutely no question to whom it was directed.""
""Contrary to what the Democratic Leader has tried to claim, he very, very clearly was not addressing Republican lawmakers or anyone else. He literally directed the statement to the justices by name.""
""The minority leader of the United States Senate threatened two associate justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Period,"" he said.
Top legal mind Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University, tweeted, ""Schumer's threat to the Court that 'you will pay the price' is a direct attack on the integrity of our courts. I criticized Trump for his reckless comments about the courts. Where is the chorus of condemnation of Schumer? Schumer sounded more like a stalker than a statesman.""
Sen. Josh Hawley wrote that he believes Schumer should face censure for the statement: ""I would call on Schumer to apologize, but we all know he has no shame. So tomorrow I will introduce a motion to censure Schumer for his pathetic attempt at intimidation of #SupremeCourt.""
A spokesperson for Schumer said he was talking about the political price Republicans will pay for putting Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch on the court.
And on the Senate floor Thursday, Schumer tried to take back his threat, saying it wasn't meant to be a threat. 
""I'm from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language. I shouldn't have used the words I did but in no way was I making a threat,"" Schumer reportedly claimed.  
Hawley called that a ""non-apology"".
""Schumer refusing to take responsibility. This non-apology is the equivalent of 'I'm sorry you feel that way.' He threatened #SupremeCourt Justices. Personally. By name. He should be censured #CensureSchumer,"" Hawley tweeted.
Even liberal legal expert Laurence Tribe called Schumer's comments a serious danger.
Tribe tweeted, ""These remarks by @SenSchumer were inexcusable. Chief Justice Roberts was right to call him on his comments. I hope the Senator, whom I've long admired and consider a friend, apologizes and takes back his implicit threat. It's beneath him and his office.""
Conservative activist James Woods warns that these types of verbal threats pose a serious danger because they sometimes trigger violence by extremists.
""He makes these thuggish threats, the #Antifa hoodlums take up arms. This is how @SteveScalise was almost murdered by a #BernieBro. It's astonishing that the Senate Democrat leader would threaten Justices of the Supreme Court,"" Woods tweeted.

Bloomberg Drops Out After Biden Scores a Big 'Super Tuesday' Surge and Sanders Wins Top Prize
A Third Top Candidate Drops Out as Democrats Prepare for Super Tuesday
Warren's exit extinguished hopes that Democrats would get another try at putting a woman up against President Donald Trump. 
For much of the past year, the Massachusetts senator's campaign had all the markers of success, robust poll numbers, impressive fundraising and a sprawling political infrastructure that featured staffers on the ground across the country. She was squeezed out, though, by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who had an immovable base of voters she needed to advance. 
Warren never finished higher than third in the first four states and was routed on Super Tuesday, failing to win any of the 14 states voting and placing an embarrassing third in Massachusetts, behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders. 
Her exit from the race following Sen. Amy Klobuchar's departure leaves the Democratic field with just one female candidate: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who has collected only one delegate toward the nomination. It was an unexpected twist for a party that had used the votes and energy of women to retake control of the House, primarily with female candidates, just two years ago.
Warren's campaign began with enormous promise that she could carry that momentum into the presidential race. Last summer, she drew tens of thousands of supporters to Manhattan's Washington Square Park, a scene that was repeated in places like Washington state and Minnesota. 
She had a compelling message, calling for “structural change” to the American political system to reorder the nation's economy in the name of fairness. She had a signature populist proposal for a 2% wealth tax she wanted to impose on households worth more than $50 million that prompted chants of “Two cents! Two cents!"" at rallies across the country. 
Warren, 70, began her White House bid polling near the back of an impossibly crowded field, used wonky policy prowess to rocket to front-runner status by the fall, then saw her support evaporate almost as quickly.
Her candidacy appeared seriously damaged almost before it started after she released a DNA test in response to goading by Trump to prove she had Native American ancestry. Instead of quieting critics who had questioned her claims, however, the test offended many tribal leaders who rejected undergoing the genetic test as culturally insensitive, and it didn’t stop Trump and other Republicans from gleefully deriding her as “Pocahontas.""
Warren also lost her finance director over her refusal to attend large fundraisers, long considered the financial lifeblood of national campaigns. Still, she distinguished herself by releasing dozens of detailed proposals on all sorts of policies from canceling college debt to protecting oceans to containing the coronavirus. Warren also was able to build an impressive campaign war chest relying on mostly small donations that poured in from across the country -- erasing the deficit created by refusing to court big, traditional donors. 
As her polling began improving through the summer. Warren appeared to further hit her stride as she hammered the idea that more moderate Democratic candidates, including Biden, weren’t ambitious enough to roll back Trump's policies and were too reliant on political consultants and fickle polling. And she drew strength in the #MeToo era, especially after a wave of female candidates helped Democrats take control of the U.S. House in 2018.
But Warren couldn't consolidate the support of the Democratic Party’s most liberal wing against the race’s other top progressive, Sanders. Both supported universal, government-sponsored health care under a “Medicare for All” program, tuition-free public college and aggressive climate change fighting measures as part of the “Green New Deal” while forgoing big fundraisers in favor of small donations fueled by the internet.
Warren's poll numbers began to slip after a series of debates when she repeatedly refused to answer direct questions about if she'd have to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. Her top advisers were slow to catch on that not providing more details looked to voters as a major oversight for a candidate who proudly had so many other policy plans. 
When Warren finally moved to correct the problem, her support eroded further. She moved away from a full endorsement of Medicare for All, announcing that she'd work with Congress to transition the country to the program over three years. In the meantime, she said, many Americans could “choose” to remain with their current, private health insurance plans, which most people have through their employers. Biden and other rivals pounced, calling Warren a flip-flopper, and her standing with progressives sagged. 
Sanders, meanwhile, wasted little time capitalizing on the contrast by boasting that he would ship a full Medicare for All program for congressional approval during his first week in the White House. After long avoiding direct conflict, Warren and Sanders clashed in January after she said Sanders had suggested during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman couldn’t win the White House. Sanders denied that, and Warren refused to shake his outstretched hand after a debate in Iowa. 
Leaning hard into the gender issue only saw Warren's support sink further heading into Iowa's leadoff caucus, however. But even as her momentum was slipping away, Warren still boasted impressive campaign infrastructure in that state and well beyond. Her army of volunteers and staffers looked so formidable that even other presidential candidates were envious.
Just before Iowa, her campaign released a memo detailing its 1,000-plus staffers nationwide and pledging a long-haul strategy that would lead to victories in the primary and the general election. Bracing for a poor finish in New Hampshire, her campaign issued another memo again urging supporters to stay focus on the long game - but also expressly spelling out the weaknesses of Sanders, Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, in ways the senator herself rarely did. 
Warren got a foil for all of her opposition to powerful billionaires when former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg entered the race. During a debate in Las Vegas just before Nevada's caucus, Warren hammered Bloomberg and the mayor's lackluster response touched off events that ended with him leaving the race on Wednesday.
For Warren, That led to a sharp rise in fundraising but didn't translate to electoral success. She tried to stress her ability to unite the fractured Democratic party, but that message fell flat. 
By South Carolina, an outside political group began pouring more than $11 million into TV advertising on Warren's behalf, forcing her to say that, although she rejected super PACs, she'd accept their help as long as other candidates did. Her campaign shifted strategy again, saying it was betting on a contested convention. 
Still, the longer Warren stayed in the race, the more questions she faced about why she was doing so with little hope of winning - and she started to sound like a candidate who was slowly coming to terms with that. 
“I’m not somebody who has been looking at myself in the mirror since I was 12 years old saying, ‘You should run for president,’” Warren said aboard her campaign bus on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, previewing a ceasing of campaigning that wasn't yet official. “I started running for office later than anyone who is in this, so it was never about the office - it was about what we could do to repair our economy, what we could do to mend a democracy that's being pulled apart. That’s what I want to see happen, and I just want to see it happen.”
She vowed to fight on saying, ""I cannot say, for all those little girls, this got hard and I quit. My job is to persist.”
But even that seemed impossible after a Super Tuesday drubbing that included her home state.

The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) is sounding the alarm about violence against religious minorities in Delhi, India. 
Mobs are terrorizing the streets, targeting mostly Muslims.
Christians are also being targeted for evangelizing.
Last week more than 40 people were killed, hundreds more were injured in brutal attacks.
It's the culmination of tensions following the amendment of India's citizenship laws in December. The changes give people coming from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Pakistan of Christian or any faith other than Islam a pathway to citizenship.
200 million Muslims live in India making up 14 percent of the population.
Tensions are amplified by the Indian government's efforts to create a national register of citizens which requires people to show documents to prove their citizens that many don't have.
""We're seeing the worst communal violence in decades,"" Anurima Bhargava, a USCIRF commissioner tells CBN News.
""India is a place where people of all faiths have lived together I harmony through many, many years, through hundreds of years and in some ways that's why this moment is of such concern to people because the citizenship laws and this effort to try and have people document whether or not they are part of communities that they have been part of for so long is something that's giving license to people to feel like they can target or direct violence to these communities,"" she explains.
On a bright note, Bhargava says people of all faiths are reaching out and offering protection to those being persecuted even offering their houses of worship as places of sanctuary."

Betsy DeVos Speaks Out on Faith, Schools","US Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who is a key player in the nation's ongoing discussion about school choice and academic reform, is a devout Christian with a lifetime commitment to her faith.
And in a recent interview with ""The Pure Flix Podcast,"" DeVos dove deep into her biblical roots, her passion for education and her perspective on potential reforms.
""I was fortunate enough to be born into a family that raised me to make my faith my own,"" she said. ""I had exposure from my first memories to weekly church services.""

While DeVos was brought up in a Christian home, it wasn't until her teen years that her faith was more firmly rooted.
""My faith really became my own when I was a late teen, early 20s,"" she said, adding that she has since had continued challenges that have helped her learn and grow. ""I'm grateful to have had that foundation.""
The Trump-appointee went on to note that faith is ""foundational to everything"" she does, explaining how her views about individual value translate to the educational realm.
""I firmly believe every single child is a uniquely created individual with great potential and there are too many kids that are just not able to develop that full potential, because they are in a place that simply is not cultivating that for whatever reason,"" DeVos said.
Listen to DeVos share her faith journey and her passion for education:
She noted that there are many teachers across the U.S. who are doing a wonderful job but added her belief that the system, as it currently stands, doesn't meet diverse needs.
""Kids are different,"" DeVos said. ""They learn differently and a one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter approach does not work.""

She spoke to her own experience in K-12 education and expressed her wish that she had been more fervently challenged, and opened up about what led to her personal passion for reforming the contemporary educational system.
DeVos said it all started when she began to volunteer at a local Christian school and saw firsthand some of the ""choice"" issues at play.
""My passion around education really grew when my oldest son — who's just about 38 — was starting kindergarten,"" she said. ""My husband and I knew we were going to be able to send our children wherever we wanted to, but I started getting involved with a small Christian school [and] the more I did ... the more I realized that, for every family that had their child there, there were probably 10 or 20 other families in that neighborhood who longed to have their children in a place like that.""
DeVos said she and her family soon started supporting scholarships to help students attend such schools, and that she realized it is a ""policy issue,"" as many families simply lacked the economic ability to make the same choices.

""[I realized] those families [didn't] have the economic means to be able to make that choice,"" she said. ""And yet their children are every bit as special and precious as mine are. So that really spurred my interest in what I refer to as 'education freedom' — school choice, very broadly.""
DeVos also spent 15 years as an in-school mentor for at-risk kids, an experience she said was ""very formative"" and beneficial. She's still in touch with one of the students — a girl she started working within the first grade; she is now a college sophomore.
""I'm very proud of her,"" DeVos said. ""I continue to encourage her to be everything God meant her to be.""
These experiences helped inform DeVos' educational worldview and her penchant for reform. Her goal, she said, is academic freedom for all.
""We enjoy freedom in almost every other area of our life,"" she said. ""And yet the K-12 years for almost a century and a half here have been very much a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach and it's time to change that.""
DeVos added, ""When you think about the fact that young people today represent 100 percent of our country's future ... we need to make sure that every single one of them has the opportunity to fully develop their gifts and talents innate in them.""
While she said she never had any expectation that she would become a US education secretary, she didn't hesitate to take the opportunity when it arose.
But DeVos said making change is an uphill battle.
""Big, large complex systems and organizations don't change easily and they don't recognize uniqueness and they don't recognize differences in how you learn,"" she said. ""It is a system that exists to really serve itself, not do what's best for individual children.""

DeVos also had a message about teachers who might find that the system they're working in ""isn't working for them"" — that they will be ""highly valued in a system of freedom and choices.""
As for the controversy that has surrounded her policy recommendations, she was candid and yet resolute.
""There have been a lot of misconceptions, misperceptions sown about me, but the reality is that my heart is with kids,"" DeVos said. ""And I'm for them and for their futures and I'm for their parents to have the kind of opportunity to make the choices that I was able to make for my kids.""

Newswatch is seen weekdays on the CBN News Channel. For a programming schedule, click here. 
On Wednesday, Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) introduced legislation that would require abortion providers to inform expectant mothers of the medical risks of an abortion, as well as the gestational age of the unborn child, and its development features.
The measure is known as the ""Woman's Right to Know Act"" would set national standards requiring all abortion providers to (1) explain all the medical risks associated with an abortion procedure. (2) Inform the patient of the current gestational age and development features of the unborn child, and (3) present this medical information at least 24 hours prior to an abortion procedure.

The bill is modeled after the Georgia state law with the same name (House Bill 197). There are currently 34 states that require medical counseling for the mother before an abortion is performed.
""A patient's ability to give informed consent is a core principle of modern medical practice,"" Loeffler said. ""The 'Woman's Right to Know Act' provides accurate medical advice and counseling to those who seek an elective abortion. Without it, we are unable to ensure that every woman is fully informed of the consequences of their potentially life-altering decision. Through this legislation, patients will have a comprehensive understanding of pregnancy options and information at their disposal. There is no reason that this information shouldn't be provided upfront when having such an important conversation.""
Blackburn says the legislation will mandate that abortion providers inform a woman considering the procedure about all the medical risks of an abortion.
""The consequences of an abortion are grave and irreversible to both the mental and physical health of the mother and child,"" the Tennessee senator explained. ""Tragically, the abortion industry sees a financial incentive to encourage a mother to have an abortion. By requiring that physicians and expectant mothers have a discussion about the lasting effects of elective abortion, we can ensure that women are well-informed before choosing to proceed.""
The abortion industry has often fought against having to offer pregnant women ultrasounds or having to share the more negative aspects of an abortion.
TO HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD ON ABORTION GO HERE TO PROTECT THE UNBORN.
The proposed bill to enhance informed consent protections for patients has received praise from pro-life groups across the country. 
""National Right to Life commends Sens. Loeffler and Blackburn for introducing the Woman's Right to Know Act,"" said Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee. ""Numerous states have established laws ensuring that a mother is given a chance to consider all of her options and receive important information to help her make an informed decision. We support the effort to make this a nation-wide protection – one critical in saving the lives of innocent children and ensuring that women have a right to know the facts about their unborn child."" 
""Women deserve the truth. Withholding facts about the very serious health risks associated with abortion procedures and the scientific truth about the baby developing in their womb benefits no one except abortion businesses who prey on women making life-altering decisions,"" said Joshua Edmonds, executive director of Georgia Life Alliance. ""If the argument that abortion should be 'safe, legal, and rare' is a genuine one, then we look forward to supporting the Woman's Right to Know Act from senators on both sides of the aisle."" 
""We are so thankful to Senators Loeffler and Blackburn for introducing this legislation that will protect women from this dangerous procedure,"" said the Honorable Marilyn Musgrave, Susan B. Anthony List vice president of government affairs. ""Women deserve to be notified of the medical risks involved in abortion and receive a full disclosure regarding the development of the child within them. We wholeheartedly support the Woman's Right to Know Act and urge Senators to stand behind this commonsense legislation that sets reasonable standards for the abortion industry.""
The Woman's Right to Know Act is the first bill Loeffler introduced in the US Senate since she was sworn in less than two months ago on January 6.  Co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Rick Scott (R-FL), Mike Braun (R-IN), and James Lankford (R-OK).
The legislation is supported by the Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life Committee, March for Life, Georgia Life Alliance, Heritage Action for America, the Family Research Council and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. "

The House will vote on the deal later Wednesday and Senate leaders are pressing for a vote in that chamber by the end of the week.
The legislation came together unusually quickly, a rarity in a deeply polarized Washington. It triples the $2.5 billion plan unveiled by President Donald Trump just last week.
Trump, however, is sure to sign the measure, which has the blessing of top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and top House Republican Kevin McCarthy of California.
The agreement came together after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., dropped a demand, opposed by the drug industry, to guarantee that any vaccines and drug treatments developed with government-backed research — but manufactured by drug companies — be offered at “affordable” prices.
Instead, the agreement provides $300 million for the government to purchase and distribute such drugs to those who need it at “fair and reasonable” prices — which is the standard applied in earlier outbreaks like the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak.
The bipartisan legislation includes $350 million to aggressively go after the virus in “hot spots” like Washington state; $500 million to buy drugs, masks, and other medical supplies for states, local governments and hospitals; $1 billion to reimburse state and local governments for costs incurred in battling the outbreak; and $300 million for the Centers for Disease Control’s rapid response fund.
More than $800 million would fund research into a vaccine, improved tests, and drugs to treat infected people. Another $1.3 billion would be used to help fight the virus overseas.

The agreement comes as the outbreak in the U.S. appears increasingly likely to affect workers who are instructed to stay home, immigrants who may fear seeking treatment because they are in the U.S. illegally, and the potential rapid spread among homeless people. Widespread school closures are possible as well.
Vice President Mike Pence, who is coordinating the administration’s response, is returning to Capitol Wednesday afternoon to separately brief House Democrats and Republicans.
Also Wednesday, top congressional leaders are meeting to discuss what additional steps may be needed to ensure the safety of the Capitol complex — for lawmakers and staff, as well as the annual influx of visitors this spring.

A person close to the Bloomberg campaign confirmed the deliberations. The person wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter by name and requested anonymity.
Bloomberg spent more than half a billion dollars on his presidential campaign. But Tuesday marked the first elections where he was on ballots. Former Vice President Joe Biden won key states like Virginia and North Carolina where Bloomberg had spent millions of dollars and campaigned heavily.
Fourteen states voted in Tuesday’s primaries. Polls in California, the biggest delegate haul, have not yet closed.

Instead of continuing to challenge Joe Biden, he's throwing his support behind the former vice president as key Democrats work to boost Biden's chances of beating socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The news comes after Biden surged to victory across the South on Super Tuesday as voters across 14 states voted in the biggest 2020 campaign event to date with more than 1,300 Democratic delegates at stake. 
Biden opened the evening with a trio of victories in key Southern states, building on the momentum that has swiftly revived his Democratic presidential campaign in recent days. His big wins give him momentum and front-runner status for the Democratic nomination.

Biden Wins South Carolina, Aims for Super Tuesday Momentum
Biden snagged the second-biggest state, winning Texas as the votes trickled in overnight. And overall, Biden won far more states than his top rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, taking Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Massachusetts, Minnesota and the battleground states of North Carolina and Virginia. The wins in some heavily African American southern states came after the former vice president’s victory in last weekend’s South Carolina primary.
Still, Sanders was also a big winner on Tuesday. He grabbed a win in home-state Vermont, Colorado, Utah, and California – the night's biggest prize with its 415 delegates. 
The delegate tally isn't clear yet because the Democrats don't have a winner-take-all system. But Biden is now leading in the delegate count and feeling confident after his strong showing. ""We were told, well, when you get to Super Tuesday it'd be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy,"" Biden said.
But Sanders shows no signs of discouragement. ""I tell you with absolute confidence, we're going to win the Democratic nomination.""
What About Elizabeth Warren?
Sen. Elizabeth Warren didn't even win her home state of Massachusetts on Super Tuesday. Even though it was a tight-race, Biden edged out Warren and Sanders to claim victory. So it's unclear how long Warren will remain in the race.
Virginia was an especially key battle to watch because Sanders and billionaire former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg heavily contested it over the past week.
As we've seen over the past few years, Virginia has begun to turn bluer mainly because of the Democrats' strength in urban areas and the northern Virginia suburbs outside of Washington, DC.  Virginia also had an open primary, meaning any registered voter can vote regardless of their party registration. 
With Biden winning the Virginia primary, and every other state that Bloomberg contested with roughly half a billion dollars in advertising, Bloomberg has now decided to drop out. Bloomberg's only victory was in the American territory of Samoa.
Delegate Count
The most delegate-rich states on Super Tuesday were California, Texas, North Carolina and Virginia which add up to more than 850 delegates alone. After Tuesday's vote totals, nearly 40 percent of the total delegates will be awarded to the winners.  
Tuesday also marked the first major election security test since the 2018 midterm elections. State and local officials said they were prepared to deal with everything from equipment problems to false information about the coronavirus. And unlike the Iowa caucuses, which were run by state parties, state and local election officials administered Tuesday's elections in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.
A candidate needs 1,991 votes from the respective delegates to secure the Democratic Party nomination.  
Democrats will gather in Milwaukee this July for their convention."

Sen. Amy Klobuchar ended her campaign Monday and endorsed Biden at a rally in Texas where former candidate Beto O'Rourke also took the stage to endorse Biden. Ahead of the rally, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who ended his campaign Sunday, joined former Vice President Biden in Texas to throw his support behind him, as well. 
 
""I'm looking for a leader, I'm looking for a President who will draw out what is best in each of us, and I'm encouraging everybody from my campaign to join me because we have found that leader in Vice President, soon to be President Joe Biden,"" said Buttigieg.  
 
Even with the boost for Biden from former candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders still leads the polls heading into Super Tuesday in delegate-rich Texas and California, so the question remains whether Biden can catch him.
 
""And with your help, we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of modern of America,"" Sanders told a cheering crowd at a recent rally. 
 
Billionaire Mike Bloomberg ignored early voting states hoping to make a splash on Super Tuesday with his ballot debut.
 
""I honestly think that Mike Bloomberg is maybe a bit out of his depth and got excited about running for president because he had the resources to do it and certainly some experience, but I don't think that he's going to be particularly successful,"" North Carolina Democratic voter Michael Bender tells CBN News.   
 
Bender says he was a Buttigieg supporter, but now plans to vote for Sen. Elizabeth Warren even though he's not sure if she has a path to winning the nomination.
 
""That's probably one of my biggest skepticisms about voting for her tomorrow, a big concern of mine, but I think if everybody had that attitude on Super Tuesday, why even cast a vote?"" he continued.

Amy Klobuchar ended her Democratic presidential campaign on Monday and endorse rival Joe Biden in an effort to unify moderate voters behind the former vice president's White House bid.
She is flying to Dallas and plans to join Biden at his rally Monday night.
Klobuchar outlasted several better-known and better-funded Democrats, thanks to a better-than-expected third-place finish in New Hampshire. But she couldn't turn that into success elsewhere, as she struggled to build out a campaign that could compete across the country and had poor showings in the next contests.
The three-term senator had one of this cycle's more memorable campaign launches, standing outside in a Minnesota snowstorm last February to tout her “grit” and Midwestern sensibilities. Klobuchar argued that her record of getting things done in Washington and winning even in Republican parts of her state would help her win traditionally Democratic heartland states like Wisconsin and Michigan that flipped in 2016 to give Donald Trump the presidency.
She was hoping to own the moderate lane of a Democratic field that grew to some two dozen candidates. But that got much tougher when Biden joined the race in April, starting as a front-runner and remaining there. Klobuchar also was quickly overshadowed by Pete Buttigieg, a fellow Midwesterner who shot from being the largely unknown mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to a top contender on a mix of intelligence, strong oratory and youthful optimism. Buttigieg dropped out on Sunday, saying he no longer had a viable path to the nomination.
Klobuchar entered the race with low name recognition compared with many of her rivals, a disadvantage she was still citing a year into her campaign. Outside Minnesota, the lawyer and former prosecutor was best known for her questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow teenager when both were in high school if he ever had so much to drink that he didn't remember what happened. Kavanaugh retorted, “Have you?” Klobuchar continued, unruffled, and Kavanaugh later apologized to the senator, whose father is recovering from alcoholism.
Even before she got into the race, Klobuchar was hit with news stories claiming she mistreated her Senate staff, and she had a higher-than-usual turnover rate in her office. Klobuchar said she is a “tough boss” but countered that she has several longtime employees, including the manager of her presidential campaign.
She also faced questions over her prosecutor's past. In January, The Associated Press published a story about Klobuchar's office in Minneapolis having prosecuted the case of a black teenager accused of the 2002 shooting death of an 11-year-old girl. Klobuchar has cited the story to show her toughness on crime. But an AP/APM Reports investigation uncovered new evidence and myriad inconsistencies, raising questions about whether Myon Burrell was railroaded by police. The issue followed Klobuchar on the campaign trail, with protesters forcing her to cancel a rally in suburban Minneapolis days before Super Tuesday.
Klobuchar campaigned on her productivity in Washington, where she led more than 100 bills that were signed into law. And she criticized the more liberal candidates in the field, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, for running on promises she said they couldn't keep.
Rather than advocate for “Medicare for All,” for example, Klobuchar favored expanding the Affordable Care Act and working to reduce prescription drug costs - changes she said had a chance of passing and would make a significant impact. She supported making community colleges free but said she wouldn't promise to do the same for four-year colleges and universities because the U.S. cannot afford it.
“I've got to tell the truth,” she said during a CNN town hall at a college campus, where she acknowledged her position may be unpopular with younger voters.
Klobuchar was one of the first candidates to outline a plan for addressing addiction and mental health, an issue she described as personal because of her father's longtime struggle. Her accounts of growing up with a father suffering from alcoholism and watching him be forced to choose between prison or treatment were some of the most compelling moments of speeches, interviews and discussions with voters. Klobuchar said that her father described getting help as being “pursued by grace” and that it's an opportunity all people fighting addiction deserve.
But Klobuchar couldn't match her top competitors in fundraising. She raised about $11 million in the last quarter of 2019 - roughly half of what Sanders and Buttigieg received. The lack of finances early on in the campaign meant Klobuchar wasn't able to expand her operation on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire until months after her rivals. She then scrambled to put an operation in place in Nevada, South Carolina and the 14 states that voted on Super Tuesday.
Still, there were bright spots, including strong debate performances that helped bring in new donors. Her campaign credited Klobuchar's showing in a debate days before the New Hampshire primary with helping her clinch a better-than-expected third place in the state's primary, topping Warren and Biden. Klobuchar said she raised $12 million in the next week.
During one debate she addressed sexism in the campaign, questioning whether a woman with Buttigieg's experience would qualify for the stage. She also pushed back at fears of a female candidacy, saying, “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi does it every day.”
In January, she earned endorsements from The New York Times, which also endorsed Warren, and the Quad-City Times, one of Iowa's largest newspapers. But Klobuchar was sidelined for much of the last few weeks before the Iowa caucuses when she - along with fellow candidates Warren, Sanders and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado - was stuck in Washington for the Senate impeachment trial.
She continued to rack up endorsements even as her campaign struggled, getting the backing of newspapers including the Houston Chronicle, The Seattle Times and the New Hampshire Union Leader."

Two of the candidates indicate they'll throw their support to former Vice President Joe Biden.
Monday afternoon, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar became the latest candidate to pull out of the race. She had positioned herself as being more moderate than candidates like socialist Bernie Sanders, and she had done well enough to earn a third-place spot in the New Hampshire primary. But she didn't do well in the following races, so now she's ending her run and endorsing Biden.

Biden heads into tomorrow's Super Tuesday primaries with some newfound momentum after dominating the South Carolina primary Saturday.
 
Now all the focus is on Super Tuesday as voters in 14 states cast ballots. Voters in states like North Carolina, Virginia, Texas, and California are preparing to head to the polls, and more than a third of the total number of Democratic delegates will be decided.
After losing badly in the early contests like Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden heads into Super Tuesday after winning South Carolina by almost 30%. ""This campaign is taking off, so join us!"" an excited Biden told the crowd after the results came in. ""The days of Donald Trump's divisiveness will soon be over.""
 
Biden's campaign says they raised more than five million dollars after his Saturday win. His supporters are predicting more good things to come. ""I think it really shows the country that we're on the path to success,"" Biden supporter Robert Lewis told CBN News.  
 
Biden supporters are also touting his electability. ""He's the only candidate who can beat Donald Trump,"" claims Georgetown student Annalise Myre.
Two More Democrats Drop Out
Biden's comeback win in South Carolina appeared to have prompted several other Democratic contenders to drop out over the weekend.
 
Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer put his best efforts, including tens of millions of dollars, into a big win in South Carolina, but after finishing third, he called it quits Saturday night.
 
More big news came when Mayor Pete Buttigieg dropped out Sunday night. He was in third place in the national delegate count behind Sen. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, but he couldn't see a clear path to victory. There are reports that Buttigieg, like Klobuchar, will also endorse Biden to help unite moderate Democrats behind him. 
 
""I will no longer seek to be the Democratic nominee for president but I will do everything in my power to ensure we have a new Democratic president come January,"" announced Buttigieg.
 
As the field narrows, Steyer and Buttigieg's exits could be troubling for Bernie Sanders. ""I'm just not confident that he can beat Donald Trump, number one, just flat out, and he didn't resonate with me,"" Steyer supporter Nocola Hemphill told CBN News.
 
Many of their former supporters tell CBN News they're wary of Sanders' plans, like ""Medicare For All"".
 
""Don't throw us in a system if we don't want it,"" said Buttigieg supporter Joshelyn James.
 
The Biden campaign stands ready to expand its base. ""We are very much alive!"" declared Biden Saturday.
 
Most Democrats seem willing to back the eventual nominee – no matter who that is. ""We're all going to come together as Democrats and support the ticket,"" predicts Biden supporter Charles McClam.
 
For the candidates still in the race who don't win a sizable portion of the delegates on Super Tuesday, this could be the end of the line."

He warned that specific form of government that's gaining popularity among America's younger voters, would do great damage if it gains power here.

Trump then lined up what he said those socialists' goals are. He stated, ""They want to take away your money, take away your choice, take away your speech, take away your guns, take away your religion, take away your history, take away your future and take away ultimately your freedom.""

At the end, President Trump assured everyone that America is thriving and promised that ""the best is yet to come.""
""With your help and the good Lord's Grace we will continue to push onward to our nation's magnificent destiny. We will continue to make our republic the inspiration to glory and the envy of the world.

(AP) — Joe Biden scored a thundering victory in South Carolina’s Democratic primary on Saturday, riding a wave of African American support and ending progressive rival Bernie Sanders’ winning streak.
Biden’s win came at a do-or-die moment in his 2020 bid as the moderate Democrat bounced back from underwhelming performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. The race now pivots immediately to a new phase when 14 “Super Tuesday” states take the campaign nationwide early next week.
“We are very much alive,” Biden declared at an exuberant post-election rally. “For all of you who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind -- this is your campaign.”
Sanders claimed second place, though his loss gave a momentary respite to anxious establishment Democrats who feared that the self-described democratic socialist would finish February with four consecutive top finishes.
Billionaire activist Tom Steyer took third place, his best showing of the campaign, but he formally suspended his campaign. He spent more $24 million on television advertising in South Carolina -- more than all of his rivals combined -- but never found a clear lane in the crowded contest.
Seven candidates remain in the Democrats’ quest to find the strongest possible nominee to take on President Donald Trump in November.
Biden’s allies almost immediately cast the South Carolina victory as proof that he should stand as the clear alternative to Sanders.
The South Carolina primary was the first major test of the candidates’ appeal among black voters. And while it gave the 77-year-old Biden a win when he most needed it, he must still prove that he has the financial and organizational resources to dramatically expand his campaign in the next 72 hours. He will also be under pressure to rely on his decades-long relationships with party leaders to create a new sense of inevitability around his candidacy.
The Associated Press declared Biden the winner just after the polls closed in South Carolina. The AP based the call on data from AP VoteCast, a survey of the electorate conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago. The survey showed a convincing win for Biden.
Even before news of Biden’s win was declared, Mike Bloomberg announced his own plan to deliver a three-minute prime-time address Sunday night on two television networks. He didn’t say how much he paid for the air time, which is unprecedented in recent decades.
Bloomberg’s campaign privately acknowledged that Biden was likely to get a bump in momentum out of his South Carolina win, but they still believe Bloomberg can win in a handful of states that vote on Super Tuesday, including Arkansas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Virginia and North Carolina.
And Sanders was already peeking ahead to Super Tuesday as well, betting he can amass an insurmountable delegate lead at that point. After two consecutive victories and a tie for the lead in Iowa, the 78-year-old Vermont senator’s confidence is surging.
Sanders congratulated Biden on his first win and said it was nothing for his own supporters to worry about.
“Tonight, we did not win in South Carolina. That will not be the only defeat. A lot of states in this country. Nobody wins them all,” he told a cheering crowd in Virginia, one of 14 states to vote next week. “Now we enter Super Tuesday.”
Moments after Biden’s victory was confirmed, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe formally endorsed the former vice president and encouraged the Democratic Party’s moderate wing to unite behind him. On CNN, he called on several candidates to get out of the race — “not after Tuesday, but tomorrow.”
Biden needs help.
Compared to his rivals, he’s barely running any television advertising in Super Tuesday states. And both Sanders and Bloomberg have many more staff and volunteers.
With few other options, Biden’s team hopes to lean on his growing team of high-profile endorsers, including McAuliffe, to tap their own political networks and help spread his message in the media.
The Democrats’ 2020 primary election isn’t yet a two- or even three-person race.
Not ceding anything, Pete Buttigieg is fighting to prove he can build a multiracial coalition. And with the help of super PACs, Warren and Klobuchar vowed to keep pushing forward no matter what.
Trump was paying close attention to the Democratic race.
Speaking before conservative activists earlier in the day, the president conducted a poll of sorts by asking his audience to cheer for who would be the best Democratic contender for him to face in November.
Sanders was the clear winner.
“How could you be easier to beat than Joe? That guy can’t put two sentences together,” Trump told attendees of the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington. “But you know he is more down the middle. Everyone knows he’s not a communist and with Bernie there a real question about that.”
Saturday was all about Biden and whether he might convince anxious establishment Democrats to rally behind him at last.
Elected officials inclined to embrace his moderate politics had been reluctant to support him after bad finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire and a distant second place in Nevada last week. Yet fearing Sanders’ polarizing progressive priorities, they’re still searching for an alternative who’s viewed as a safer bet to defeat Trump in November.
South Carolina represented much more than the fourth state on the Democrats’ months-long primary calendar.
It served as the first major test of the candidates’ strength with African American voters, who will be critical both in the general election and the rest of the primary season.
Biden won 60% of the votes cast by African Americans. He also did well with older voters, women, moderates and conservatives and regular churchgoers, according to AP VoteCast.
Sanders earned the support of roughly 15% of African American voters, while billionaire businessman Tom Steyer won 16%.
There was also evidence that Biden’s status as former President Barack Obama’s two-term vice president helped him win over African Americans.
VoteCast found that 45% voters in South Carolina wanted to return to the politics of the past, compared to about a third in Iowa and New Hampshire. That includes the roughly 50% of African American voters who said they want a Democratic presidential nominee who would emulate the Obama’s presidency.
While voting technology was a concern in two of the last three primary contests, South Carolina uses a wide array of voting technology that presents unique challenges.
Saturday’s election in South Carolina marks the first statewide test of its new fleet of electronic voting machines, a $50 million upgrade from an old and vulnerable system that lacked any paper record of individual votes. The new machines produce a paper record that can be verified by the voter and checked after the election to detect any malfunction or manipulation.
Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez cautioned Democrats that it’s still early in their presidential primary.
Speaking at a North Carolina Democratic Party fundraising gala, Perez noted that to win the nomination, a Democrat must win 1,991 delegates — and only a fraction of those have been allocated in the party’s first four primaries.
“We have a long way to go,” he said.

Since it’s called the Conservative Political Action Conference, you might assume it’s all about politics. But through the halls and in the ballrooms and across the exhibit areas, activists attending CPAC have much more on their minds than just politics and the next election.
Weaponizing Information
They’re involved with every issue across the spectrum. For instance, national security analyst Tony Shaffer of the London Center for Policy Research is concerned with the panic over the Coronavirus, and attempts to politicize it.
He told CBN News, “Let me say this and be very clear about this because I do talk to people involved in the Trump administration on this every day. The Trump administration is doing everything possible to assess, prepare and control the outbreak, so there is no reason to panic. The panic that’s been sown is from the left-wing media all of a sudden waking up and recognizing this is an opportunity to weaponize information against Trump.”
Wanting to Deal a Death Blow to the Death Penalty
Hannah Cox of Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty came to CPAC to spread this message: states should stop executing people because sometimes the innocent get killed.
“We’ve had one person exonerated in the country from death row for every nine executions,” she exclaimed.
Cox said Christians need to remember anyone can be redeemed.
She explained, “I’ve seen real transformations of people, real reformation.   And we’ve seen people, even when they’re incarcerated, be able to make a meaningful difference. I saw a man who was on death row in Tennessee lead a Bible study and actually convert some of the prison guards that were there to guard him. I’ve seen people who’ve come out and become pastors after they’ve been released.”
Jewish Publisher Grateful for Non-Jews Backing Israel
Israeli-born David Ben-Hooren, publisher of The Jewish Voice newspaper, appreciates the support conservatives and Christians give Israel.
He can’t understand Americans who’ve soured on the Jewish nation, saying, “Israel is the number one American ally. The relationship between Israel and America is great, strong: financial, cultural, you name it.”
The Jewish publisher also had praise for the Christian news media, saying, “I have to thank the Christian networks for highlighting the truth about Israel and portraying Israel in the right way, and educating America about the true Israel.”
As for America itself, he’s worried about its fate as a majority of its young people are turning on capitalism.
Ben-Hooren said, “American universities are producing students that don’t understand reality.  They’re teaching them about socialism.”
‘Can Never Happen to Another American’
And American Conservative Union’s Matt Schlapp - the host of CPAC - is fuming about what he sees as a concerted effort over the last three years against President Trump with the Russia probe and impeachment, often without due process.
Schlapp told CBN News, “This can never happen to another American ever again.  Be they rich, be they poor, be they powerful, be they weak. No American should have their rights stripped away from them, especially when they’re just being involved in the political process.”"

Contact a financial adviser for any changes to your investments.
  PHILADELPHIA - For Republicans, the impeachment proceedings turned into cold, hard cash. 
Earlier this month, the Republican National Committee reported that it brought in $117 million in online fundraising through a campaign during the impeachment from late September through Feb. 6. About a million new donors were gained in the process.
On the other side of the coin, Democrat presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders raised $25 million in January. And Mike Bloomberg has self-financed his campaign to the tune of $188 million, spending millions on ads in Super Tuesday states. 
As the mind-boggling financial figures linked to politics come to light, nationally syndicated host and biblical investing authority Dan Celia has an important question: What if people gave to the church or to ministries like they gave to politicians?
""What could we do for the Kingdom of Christ with the resources being poured into politics?"" Celia asked. ""Can you imagine the unity we could form? Because there wouldn't be pride and egos at work, how easy it would be to build alliances with other ministries. The billions of dollars being spent on political campaigns and the hundreds of millions of dollars funneled to politicians is amazing. Can you imagine the hungry mouths that could be fed with hundreds of millions of dollars? We could wipe out poverty with what will be raised between the beginning of last year until the end of this election.""
Along these lines, biblically responsible investing, or BRI, has grown exponentially, Celia says, as Christians become more aware of how their money is being used and want to ensure that their resources, which are God's to begin with, aren't invested in ways that ultimately displease God. 
Celia, who leads Financial Issues Stewardship Ministries (FISM) and focuses on important economic trends and biblical investing during his daily, live three-hour program, ""Financial Issues,"" says a growing number of people are becoming aware that their resources should match their values. 
""Evangelical Christians not only make up an influential voting bloc, but they also are a significant percentage of investors across America,"" he said. ""My goal for the past 30-plus years has been to educate this segment of investors to take a stand against supporting offensive agendas through their investments. If Christians come together to invest and give biblically, there's no telling how the culture will be impacted.""
""Financial Issues"" is heard on more than 660 radio stations and seen on several television networks nationwide, including FISM.TV, which is viewed on several post-cable television platforms and online. "

Big names, like the president's and vice president's are drawing in the faithful. In fact, on the first morning of the conference, Vice President Mike Pence came on stage to roars from the crowd and shouted out, ""Well, hello, CPAC!""
Pence reminded his audience of a promise his boss has kept that's especially meaningful to this crowd.

""President Trump has already appointed more than 190 conservatives to our federal courts at every level,"" Pence said, ""including Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.""
Meanwhile, conservative activists worked one on one with those on the crowded conference floor.
Dozens of booths and tables jam this convention area. While some are actually selling items like caps and bumper stickers, the biggest products offered here are ideas, opportunities, and causes.
The biggest cause this year is warning about the downsides of socialism as that system of government gains more popularity among younger Americans in the form of Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT).
What You Get When a Nation Lurches Far Left
Morgan Zegers, 23, founded and heads up the Young Americans Against Socialism organization. She quoted eye-opening stats from a recent poll.
""70 percent of people my age would vote for a socialist. It said one of three millennials view Communism favorably and it said one in five millennials think that the Communist Manifesto better guarantees freedom and equality over the Declaration of Independence,"" Zegers shared.
Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and the host of CPAC, told CBN News young Americans shouldn't want socialism at all.
What You Lose
He said of socialist and communist nations, past and present, ""You eventually lose everything. It starts with your personal property, then your money, and then your opportunities. But in the end, you lose your rights.""
Ian Walters works with Schlapp at the American Conservative Union. He said of such nations, ""If you speak freely. If you express your religious freedom. If you do the things that we are accustomed to here in America guaranteed by the Constitution -- the notion that our rights are given by God and not by the government, not by the state, then they'll lock you up. That's the bottom line. You better toe the line in those socialist nations or it's off to the camps.""
Schlapp added, ""If you believe that the individual is not as important as the collective, eventually you run over the individual in the hopes of helping the collective. And it turns into running over many individuals to help an elite few who are in power.""
They'll Send the Tanks
Zegers concluded, ""And then starvation sets in, and the people who speak out about these atrocities that are happening in the country are then run over by government tanks. I think you probably saw the viral video that was all over the internet of a government tank in Venezuela running over protestors in the street. That's socialism for you.""
All of this is why CPAC made its theme this year ""America vs Socialism."" But no matter the causes pushed here at CPAC, it's pretty much all intended for the Red State voters and activists packed into the conference facility along the Potomac River. Because the issues discussed here will likely be priorities in the upcoming elections."

Even though neither the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act nor the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act received the 60 votes needed to proceed to a vote, in an exclusive interview with CBN News, McConnell defended his decision to hold the votes ahead of the 2020 elections. 
""This is an issue that people need to continue to pick a side on,"" explained McConnell. ""Science has certainly become an ally, we're learning more and more about indisputably when life begins.""
This week Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) accused McConnell of wasting the Senate's time with the votes, referring to the bills as ""extreme"" and ""dishonest"" – a claim McConnell disputes.

""There's nothing extreme about underscoring a botched abortion and the baby is born alive it's no longer about abortion it's about infanticide,"" McConnell noted. ""It's unbelievable that somebody would call that either a waste of time to have such a vote or extreme."" 
""In the last couple of years Democrats have said, 'No, we want to use taxpayers money to fund abortions.' So I think it illustrates how out of touch they are,"" McConnell continued. ""If you look at public sentiment it seems to be moving in our direction but the Democrats, virtually all of them, seem to be going in the opposite direction.""
McConnell tells CBN News he hopes to ultimately see Roe vs. Wade overturned in the courts, giving the power back to the states.
""If Roe vs. Wade was overturned, which would be my preference, it would simply send this issue back to the states and it would be decided on a state by state basis which I think would be progress because most states, not all, most states would probably enact legislation that people like myself would be sympathetic with,"" McConnell said. 
TO HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD ON ABORTION GO HERE TO PROTECT THE UNBORN.
Since President Trump took office, the Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed nearly 200 federal judges.
""It's the longest-lasting contribution we could make to the future of the country because these are lifetime appointments,"" McConnell told CBN News. 
In addition to Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, McConnell's especially proud of the circuit judge confirmations.
""Obama did 55 in eight years. We've done 51 in a little over three,"" McConnell added. ""One of every four circuit judges in the country have been put in place in the last little over three years.""   
""At the circuit level, it's particularly important because most complex legislation never makes it to the Supreme Court,"" McConnell explained. ""The circuit level is almost as important as the Supreme Court."" 
McConnell says it's also important to continue to impact the courts. That's why he hopes evangelicals who might be wary of President Trump's tweets and conduct stick with him.
""I think it's better not to get hung up on behavior, or language or that sort of thing, let's look at what's actually happening,"" McConnell said. ""I've been in the Senate a long time. I'm also the longest-serving Republican Senate leader in history. I've never seen a more solidly conservative administration than this one. And the two years, the first two years of the Trump administration when my party also controlled the house, were the best two years right of center in the over three decades that I've been here."" 
With just a handful of federal judge vacancies left to fill, McConnell says his motto for this year is ""leave no vacancy behind."" "

Sacramento Patient May Have Come Into Contact with Exposed Traveler
In a press briefing on Friday, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD),  said upon further investigation the Sacramento patient may have come into contact with an exposed traveler who had returned from an affected area, so it’s possible the patient was not infected from a person who developed the virus locally. 
Messonnier said the CDC considers the reduced and sustained number of new cases in China ""good news and hopes the trend continues not only for the people of China but also to help us learn what we can do to control its spread.""  
In response to CBN News's question for the CDC reaction to the lower death rate outside China than within, Messonnier answered, ""We continue to analyze a whole bunch of data from China and elsewhere, hoping to understand what we can expect here.""  She also said, ""Our cases are doing generally very well."" 
Federal Government Responds
President Trump is seeking $2.5 billion from Congress to prevent and battle the virus.
""Coming close to a bipartisan agreement in the Congress as to how we can go forward,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told reporters Thursday.
This as Vice President Mike Pence begins his efforts to contain the virus.
""In the days ahead we're going to make sure that the full resources of the federal government continue to be brought to bear on confronting the coronavirus here at home,"" Pence said during a meeting at the White House with his newly formed Coronavirus panel.
As concerns rise, now a whistle-blower at the Department of Health and Human Services says federal health employees who processed Americans evacuated from virus hot spots didn't have proper medical training or protective gear. 
Markets Shudder 
Fears about the virus are sending shockwaves through markets around the world.
Here at home the Dow Jones suffering its worse days since the 2008 financial crisis -- down nearly 1,200 points amid warnings from top Wall Street firms about the impact of the virus on businesses and earnings.
Financial expert Dan Celia tells CBN News while the short-term market looks bad, investors looking long term shouldn't be fearful.
""My advice is don't change anything- please, please do not get caught up in the fear of what might happen or for that matter what is happening in your investments, your 401ks, your portfolios, your IRAs,"" Celia says.
For now, uncertainties about the impact of the virus are still hurting stocks as investors and people around the world wait and see how long it takes before the disease is contained.

Bernie Sanders (D-VT) has been steamrolling through the early Democratic primaries, talking about his plans like Medicare for All and forgiving college debt.
But critics argue Sanders is not realistically talking about the astronomical costs behind these plans and who's going to pay for them.
It will take trillions upon trillions of dollars to pay for all of the Vermont senator's campaign promises. Medicare for All is estimated by various groups at around $34 trillion over 10 years, and Sanders says the Green New Deal will cost $16.3 trillion over a decade as well. (I put this in since we refer to these measures a few graphs later, plus we need to give their costs).

'Math Does Not Add Up': Democrats Attack Bernie Sanders' Socialist Ideals During Final Debate Before Super Tuesday
Not all Democrats are on board with his ideas.
""I do not support Medicare for all,"" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).
""I profoundly disagree with his solutions,"" echoed Tom Steyer.
Sanders says Medicare for All will save the country money in the long run, but he acknowledges it will be expensive.
""Well, I can't-- you know, I can't rattle off to you ever nickel and every dime. But we have accounted for-- you-- you talked about Medicare for All. We have options out there that will pay for it,"" Sanders told CBS's ""60 Minutes.""
And there's a lot to pay for. Sanders has several other proposals too.
In addition to Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, Sanders has a guaranteed housing plan he says will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years.
And among other campaign promises he has made:
$2.2 trillion to make college free and cancel all student debt.
$1.5 trillion on universal childcare and pre-kindergarten.
$1.2 trillion for K-12 education spending and higher salaries for public school teachers.
$1 trillion for infrastructure
Add it all up and it comes to around $60 trillion in new spending over the next 10 years. That's would double the size of the federal government.
Critics other than his opponents, such as conservative economist Steve Moore of The Heritage Foundation, question whether some of Sanders' new spending programs like Medicare for All, would actually work for the people they're supposed to help.
""Medicare is running out of money. The worst thing you can do for seniors is then put millions and millions, potentially tens of millions more people, on Medicare, because the system is going to collapse,"" Moore explained. ""This is one of the reasons that polls show that the two most opposed to Medicare for all are number one, senior citizens who depend on Medicare, and number two, union members who already have very good private health care plans, but would lose them under Medicare for All.""
""Remember, under Medicare for All, it's not if you like your health care plan you get to keep it. This is, if you like your health care plan, we're moving you into a new system, and this is what makes Americans very nervous,"" he continued. 
One thing basically everyone agrees on - Sanders will need to raise and even create taxes to pay for his new plans.
And he has has a long list of new taxes from increasing the payroll tax paid by employees and businesses by 80 percent, repealing President Trump's tax cuts, a wealth tax, raising capital gains taxes on investments, plus cutting military spending, and far more.
Moore says that would be bad for the country.
""I think it would do severe damage to the US economy to add all of this spending, all of these regulations, and then tax rates that would go up 50, 60, 70% we haven't had tax rates like that since the Jimmy Carter years,"" he explained. 
And economists on both sides of the political aisle argue that Sanders' new taxes would not even come close to paying for all his policies.
""The math doesn't add up. If you take all of his taxes and add them up, it still doesn't pay for it,"" Moore noted. 
That means on top of all of his new extremely costly government programs, the Sanders plan would dramatically increase America's exploding $23 trillion national debt.
""You could see over the next 10 years a doubling or even a tripling of the national debt,"" Moore added.
Sanders's enormous spending plans haven't gotten much public attention yet. But that is likely to change as he wins more and more delegates in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. "

Globally, 80,000 people have been infected and the virus has spread to 47 countries. It's on every continent other than Antarctica. 
""We're very ready for this,"" Trump told reporters. ""Whether it's going to be a breakout of larger proportions or whether or not, you know, we're at that very low level."" 
In a surprise move, he also announced Vice President Pence will lead the US response to the outbreak. 
""I look forward to serving in this role and bringing together all the members of the corona task force,"" Pence said. 
On Capitol Hill, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the risk in the US is ""low at the moment,"" adding though that the situation ""could change quickly."" 
The National Institutes of Health says that while a vaccine is in the works, it won't be available for several months.  
The best way to contain the spread of the virus is through public health measures and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling on states, businesses and public entities to draw on its resources. 
""We're in this together, all of government, the public and private sector and the CDC wants to make sure you have the best information available,"" said Trump. 
He says Congress wants to give more than $2.5 billion he's requested and at Wednesday's news conference he also criticized Democrats for making it political. 
""What he's doing is late, too late, anemic,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""Hopefully we can make up for the loss of time.""
So far, Americans seem to be heeding the warnings. At the Los Angeles International Airport, health officials were disinfecting surfaces after a Korean Airlines flight attendant tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Meanwhile, on Long Island, New York, more than 80 people are under self-quarantine after possible exposure.

Stocks Plunge for Second Day as CDC Warns Americans About COVID-19, Chance of Severe Illnesses
President Donald Trump declared Wednesday that the U.S. is “very, very ready” for whatever the coronavirus threat brings, and he put his vice president in charge of overseeing the nation's response.
Trump sought to minimize fears of the virus spreading widely across the U.S. But he said he was ready to spend “whatever's appropriate,” even if that meant the extra billions of dollars that Democrats have said is necessary to beef up the U.S. response. Trump had told Congress earlier this week that the government needed to spend $2.5 billion to fight the virus.
“We're very, very ready for this, for anything,” even if it's “a breakout of larger proportions,” Trump told a news conference at the White House.
Vice President Mike Pence will be working with the government's top health authorities, and Trump's earlier-appointed coronavirus task force, to oversee the response.
The CDC has also created a website to keep the public informed. 
Health officials say it's not a question of ""if"" the virus will spread but a matter of ""when.""
President Trump insists the US is well-prepared for any outbreak and is now considering appointing a coronavirus czar to coordinate any response. 
With a vaccine still months away, lawmakers are looking at other options to stop the spread of the virus. 
""You've heard of homeland security. Do we have enough respirators or not?,"" asked Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-LA).
The government says they need around 300 million masks and respirators.  But the 3M factory in South Dakota making them can't keep up with the demand. 
""This is not the time to shortchange the American people,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL).
The virus has spread to at least 8 nations in Europe and Brazil now has its first confirmed case.
Health officials believe containing the virus within borders will be difficult following a spike in Italy, Iran, and South Korea.
Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the threat to the US from coronavirus ""remains low.""
This as the White House seeks billions in emergency funding to combat the virus.
""What he is doing is late, too late,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). ""Hopefully we can make up for the loss of time.""
""It has been relatively contained in the United States, very few cases but people worry about the worst-case scenario what if we start seeing thousands of cases in the US, what impact would this have?"" asked The Heritage Foundation's Stephen Moore. 
Economist Moore says China's economy has been crushed over the virus and he's hearing reports it's performance could have receded by 10 percent in just the first quarter of this year.  
The stock market followed Monday's drop with another plunge of 900 points Tuesday, resulting in a loss of $1.7 trillion in value over the last two days.
""There is a lot of spooked investors out there,"" Moore told CBN News. ""We've seen about a 7 to 8 percent decline in stocks since the coronavirus first emerged. My own feeling is that once this does get contained stocks are going to bounce back, but we just don't know how long this will last."" 
Sen. Chuck Schumer is calling for an additional $6 billion to combat the outbreak. But the White House is sticking firm with its $2.5 billion request to pay for vaccines, treatment, and protective equipment. "

""Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States, and that's why Russia is helping you get elected,"" said Bloomberg.
Sanders responded, saying of Putin, ""If I am president of the United States, you're not going to interfere in any more American elections.""
Sanders, now the front runner for his party's nomination, also defended comments he has made praising Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.

Bernie Sanders Wins Nevada Democratic Caucus
""Of course, you got a dictatorship in Cuba,"" said Sanders of the issue that caused the audience to boo him. ""What I said is what Barack Obama said, in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education.""
During the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren shared how she once lost a teaching job because she was pregnant. She then tore into Bloomberg over his mistreatment of women.
""At least I didn't have a boss who said to me 'kill it' the way that Mayor Bloomberg alleged to have said to one of his pregnant employees,"" said Warren.
Bloomberg denied ever making that comment but did apologize for past offensive statements in an effort to put the issue behind him.
""Probably wrong to make the jokes,"" said Bloomberg. ""I don't remember what they were, so I assume. If it bothered them, I was wrong, and I apologize. I'm sorry for that.""
At times, it appeared the moderators lost control as the candidates spoke over one another.
Sanders was also hit hard over how he'll pay for his big spending plans like Medicare For All, the Green New Deal and free college tuition.
""No, the math does not add up,"" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""In fact, just on '60 Minutes' this weekend he said he wasn't going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes. Well, let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we're talking about. Nearly 60-trillion dollars. Do you know how much that is for all of his programs? That is three times the American economy, not the federal government, the entire American economy.""
Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is second behind Sanders in delegates, made the case that if Sanders wins the nomination, Democrats will be the big losers in November.
""I'll tell you exactly what it adds up to. It adds up as four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House, and the inability to get the Senate into Democratic hands,"" said Buttigieg. 
On the issue of peace in the Middle East, Sanders said the US should reach out to both Palestinians and the Israelis, all while bashing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
""You have a reactionary racist who is now running that country,"" said Sanders. ""I happen to believe that what our foreign policy in the Mideast should be about absolutely protecting the independence and security of Israel, but you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people. We have got to have a policy that reaches out to the Palestinians.""
Former Vice-President Joe Biden, who performed poorly Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, has called the upcoming South Carolina primary his firewall because of the support of black voters.
""I will win South Carolina,"" said Biden.
Meanwhile, with all the shouting, it's not clear exactly who won Tuesday night's debate. But it's the last one before Super Tuesday with more than 30 percent of the delegates up for grabs. "

Bernie Sanders (D-VT) in tonight's debate in South Carolina before Saturday's primary that could reshape the race. 
Sanders has pulled within just a few points of South Carolina front-runner Joe Biden. It's a pivotal state for the former vice president who hopes to shore up his faltering campaign by making a big impression among black voters there. 
Some establishment Democrats are in full panic mode as Sanders has taken a big leap forward in his bid to win the party's presidential nomination, worried that his socialist label won't go over well in the general election. Now party leaders are wondering if he can be stopped.
After spending decades as an outside agitator accustomed to attacking the party establishment, Sanders is suddenly the one on defense.
During a town hall Monday night televised on CNN, Sanders said he expected the attacks. But he still seemed to be adjusting to his new status. ""It is a little funny to find myself as the so-called front-runner,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates have been campaigning across the Palmetto State in preparation for tonight's debate.    
The state's primary election is coming up on Saturday and Sanders remains the party's front runner.
Biden, Pete Buttigieg, and Mike Bloomberg are going after Sanders in attack ads this week, both on television and online. 
Buttigieg highlighted Sanders' call for a government-financed health care system as an example of his ""polarization."" Biden accused Sanders of trying to undermine President Barack Obama when he was running for reelection in 2012. And Bloomberg assailed Sanders' record on gun control.
Heading into the debate, there are no signs that any of the seven remaining candidates are close to quitting their respective campaigns.
Tonight's debate is the second in a week and the 10th debate since the Democratic presidential campaign began. It's also the last debate before Super Tuesday next week where 14 states will vote.
The next debate is scheduled for March 15 in Phoenix, AZ. "

The president is calling on the two justices to recuse themselves from cases involving his administration.
In a tweet Monday, he called out Justices Sonya Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg over past comments. He was specifically referring to a recent dissent by Justice Sotomayor in which she accused the high court with ""putting a thumb on the scale in favor of"" Trump administration policies.
""Claiming one emergency after another, the government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases, demanding immediate attention and consuming limited court resources in each,"" Sotomayor wrote. 
""And with each successive application, of course, its cries of urgency ring increasingly hollow,"" she said, adding that the Supreme Court was ""partly to blame"" because it ""has been all too quick to grant the government's"" requests.
Also, President Trump criticized Ginsburg for making comments during his 2016 campaign, where she called him a ""faker"" who ""has no consistency about him"" and ""really has no ego.""
On Monday, Trump tweeted, ""Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices of being biased in favor of Trump."" @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to ""shame"" some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a ""faker"". Both should recuse themselves.""

At a press conference in India Tuesday morning, reporters pressed the president about what he found offensive with Sotomayor's comment.
""Her statement was so inappropriate, when you're a justice of the Supreme Court, it's almost what she's trying to do is take the people that do feel a different way and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote,"" Trump said.
""She's trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way,"" he added.
The president made those statements as he wrapped up a trip to India where he completed a sale of $3 billion in American-made weapons and also made progress on a comprehensive trade deal.
Some say strengthening the US-India alliance will weaken China's attempts to dominate the region.

Sanders was grilled by CNN’s Anderson Cooper about a number of issues, namely past comments praising Fidel Castro.
Instead of backtracking the comments, which eerily mirrored communist propaganda, Sanders chose to double down and say things weren’t all bad:
“It’s unfair to simply say everything is bad,” Sanders complained. “When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing, even though Fidel Castro did it?”

Sen. Bernie Sanders Celebrates Victory at Nevada Democratic Caucus
Cooper quickly interjected and said “a lot of dissidents in prison” weren’t big fans of Castro simply because he had a literacy program.
Humberto Fontova wrote a piece for Faithwire shortly after Castro’s death in November 2016 after an alarming number of people were praising the murderous dictator and sugar coating his legacy. Fontova detailed a number of horrific atrocities Castro perpetrated during his time in power.
Perhaps proponents of socialism and communism (and Castro) need a fresh reminder that literacy programs don’t mean anything when you’re murdering people for disagreeing politically.
Here’s what Fontova wrote:
Fidel Castro jailed and tortured political prisoners at a higher rate than Stalin during the Great Terror. He murdered more Cubans in his first three years in power than Hitler murdered Germans during his first six.
Fidel Castro shattered — through mass-executions, mass-jailings, mass larceny, and exile — virtually every family on the island of Cuba. Many opponents of the Castro regime qualify as the longest-suffering political prisoners in modern history, having suffered prison camps, forced labor and torture chambers for a period three times as long in Fidel Castro’s Gulag as Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered in Stalin’s Gulag.
Fidel Castro and Che Guevara beat ISIS to the game by over half a century. As early as January 1959 they were filming their murders for the media-shock value.
Fidel Castro also came closest of anyone in history to (wantonly) starting a worldwide nuclear war.
In the above process, Fidel Castro converted a highly-civilized nation with a higher standard of living than much of Europe and swamped with immigrants into a slum/sewer ravaged by tropical diseases and with the highest suicide rate in the Western hemisphere.
Over TWENTY TIMES as many people (and counting) have died trying to escape Castro’s Cuba as died trying to escape East Germany. Yet prior to Castroism Cuba received more immigrants per-capita than almost any nation on earth—more than the U.S. did including the Ellis Island years, in fact.
Fidel Castro helped train and fund practically every terror group on earth, from the Weathermen to Puerto Rico’s Macheteros, from Argentina’s Montoneros to Colombia’s FARC, from the Black Panthers to the IRA and from the PLO to AL Fatah.
Would anyone guess any of the above from reading or listening to the mainstream media recently?
In fact, from their reactions, all that dancing in the streets of Miami’s Little Havana this weekend seems to strike some talking heads as odd, if not downright unseemly.
But prior to the big news this week-end many of those same celebrants could be found with itchy noses and red-rimmed eyes ambling amidst long rows of white crosses in Miami’s Cuban Memorial.  It’s a mini-Arlington cemetery of sorts, in honor of Fidel Castro’s murder victims.
The tombs are symbolic, however. Most of the bodies still lie in mass graves dug by bulldozers on the orders of the man whose family President Obama just consoled with an official note of condolence.
Some of those future celebrants were often found kneeling at the Cuban Memorial, others walking slowly, looking for a name. You might remember a similar scene from the opening frames of “Saving Private Ryan.” Many clutched rosaries. Many of the ladies would be pressing their faces into the breast of a young relative who drove them there, a relative who wrapped his arms around her spastically heaving shoulders.
Try as he might not to cry himself, this relative usually found that the sobs wracking his mother, grandmother or aunt were contagious. Yet he was often too young to remember the young face of his martyred father, grandfather, uncle, cousin -or even aunt, mother grandmother– the name they just recognized on the white cross.
“Fusilado” (firing squad execution) it says below the name– one word, but for most visitors to the Cuban Memorial a word loaded with traumatizing flashbacks.
READ: Here’s How the World Reacted to the Death of a Dictator
On Christmas Eve 1961, Juana Diaz Figueroa spat in the face of the Castroite executioners who were binding and gagging her. They’d found her guilty of feeding and hiding “bandits.” (Castro and Che’s term for Cuban peasants who took up arms to fight their theft of their land to create Stalinist kolkhozes.) Farm collectivization was no more voluntary in Cuba than in the Ukraine. And Cuba’s kulaks had guns–at first anyway. Then the Kennedy-Khrushchev pact left them defenseless against Soviet tanks, helicopters and flame-throwers. When the blast from Castro’s firing squad demolished Juana Diaz’ face and torso, she was six months pregnant.
Rigoberto Hernandez was 17 when Castro’s prison guards dragged him from his jail cell, jerked his head back to gag him and started dragging him to the stake. Little “Rigo” pleaded his innocence to the very bloody end. But his pleas were garbled and difficult to understand. His struggles while being gagged and bound to the stake were also awkward. The boy had been a janitor in a Havana high school and was mentally retarded. His single mother had pleaded his case with hysterical sobs. She had begged, beseeched and finally proven to his “prosecutors” that it was a case of mistaken identity. Her only son, a boy in such a condition, couldn’t possibly have been “a CIA agent planting bombs.”
“Fuego!” and the firing squad volley riddled Rigo’s little bent body as he moaned and struggled awkwardly against his bounds, blindfold and gag. “We executive from Revolutionary conviction!” sneered the man whose peaceful death in bed President Obama seems to mourn.
Carlos Machado was 15 years old in 1963 when the bullets from the firing squad shattered his body. His twin brother and father collapsed beside Carlos from the same volley. All had resisted Castro’s theft of their humble family farm.
According to the scholars and researchers at the Cuba Archive, the Castro regime’s total death toll–from torture, prison beatings, firing squads, machine gunning of escapees, drownings, etc.–approaches 100,000. Cuba’s population in 1960 was 6.4 million. According to the human rights group Freedom House, 500,000 Cubans (young and old, male and female) have passed through Castro’s prison and forced-labor camps. This puts Fidel Castro political incarceration rate right up there with his hero Stalin’s.
It’s not enough that liberals refuse to acknowledge any justification for these Miami celebrations. No, on top of that here’s the type of thing the celebrants are accustomed to hearing from the media and famous Democrats:
“Viva Fidel! Viva Che!” (Two-time candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Jesse Jackson, bellowed while arm in arm with Fidel Castro himself in 1984.)
“Fidel Castro is very shy and sensitive, I frankly like him and regard him as a friend.” (Democratic presidential candidate, Presidential Medal of Freedom winner, and “Conscience of the Democratic party,” George Mc Govern.)
“Fidel Castro first and foremost is and always has been a committed egalitarian. He wanted a system that provided the basic needs to all Cuba has superb systems of health care and universal education…We greeted each other as old friends.”  (Former President of the United States and official “Elder Statesman” of the Democratic party, Jimmy Carter.)
“Fidel Castro is old-fashioned, courtly–even paternal, a thoroughly fascinating figure!” (NBC’s Andrea Mitchell.)
“Fidel Castro could have been Cuba’s Elvis!” (Dan Rather)
“Castro’s personal magnetism is still powerful, his presence is still commanding. Cuba has very high literacy, and Castro has brought great health care to his country.” (Barbara Walters.)
“Fidel Castro is one helluva guy!” (CNN founder Ted Turner.)
Whatever else you might say about Fidel Castro, nobody ever accused him of misreading the U.S. mainstream media.
“Much more valuable to us than military recruits for our guerrilla army were recruiting American reporters to export our propaganda.” (Fidel Castro’s sidekick Che Guevara, 1959.)
“Without the help of the New York Times, the Revolution in Cuba would never have been.” (Fidel Castro while pinning a medal on NYTimes reporter Herbert Matthews, April, 1959.)
As seen from  the quotes above, the propaganda services by much of the mainstream media for the Castro regime continues apace—despite half a century of terror-sponsorship, mass-murder, and mass-torture by the object of their adulation.

Faith Nation is seen weeknights on the CBN News Channel.  For a programming schedule, click here. 
WASHINGTON - New polling numbers show a split among Catholic voters, with those who identify themselves as devout or active Catholics being much more likely to support President Trump and other Republican candidates.
Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN) News/RealClear Opinion Research surveyed 1,521 Catholic voters between Jan. 28 and Feb. 4, and 18 percent of them – about one in five – identified as devout or active in their faith.
""This group is the one that has opinions that are distinct from much of the other 80 percent, who indicate that their religion plays a less integral role in their lives,"" said RealClear Opinion Research Polling Director John Della Volpe.
Why the Job Approval Rating is an Important Number
63 percent of that devout group approve of the job President Trump is doing versus 43 percent of other Catholics. Overall, 47 percent of Catholic voters approve of Trump's job performance.
RealClear Politics Washington Bureau Chief Carl Cannon called that an important indicator. ""Historically, if the Catholic vote is evenly divided, you're looking at a close election. It happened the last time,"" he said.
But what's also important about that overall 47 percent Catholic approval rating for Trump, Cannon indicated, ""Is that's almost exactly the national average.""
""That job approval rating in social science is the gold standard, because the question has been asked the same, word for word, starting with George Gallup in the 1930s,"" Cannon explained.
Devout Catholics Generally Pro-Trump, But Not Other Catholics
The split is also evident when all the Catholics were asked if they will definitely vote or might vote for Trump.
59 percent of the devout or active group say they will vote for him while eight percent say they might.  Among the general population of Catholic voters, 34 percent say Trump has their vote, with another 12 percent saying they might vote for him.
There is another interesting aspect about this group of active Catholics. The mainstream media often present Trump supporters as being predominately white, male and older. This poll shows 52 percent of this devout, mostly pro-Trump group are women, 41 percent are Hispanic and 48 percent are age 45 or under.
Remarkably Diverse
EWTN News Executive Editor Dr. Matthew Bunson remarked on, ""How remarkably diverse that group really is.""
""They include more people of color than Catholics generally. There are slightly more females than males,"" said Della Volpe. ""Seventy-two percent attend mass at least once a week, 92 percent pray at least once a week, and half of these Catholics are Republicans. Thirty-eight percent are Democrats, compared to the less devout Catholics who are 30 percent Republican. So they are significantly more likely to be Republican, significantly more likely to be conservative. And based upon that, it is not surprising that 59 percent indicate that they are sure to re-elect Donald Trump in 2020.""
Average Catholics Give the Edge to the Democrats
Among the general population, Catholic voters still give the edge to almost all of Trump's Democrat opponents in one-on-one matchups. The only Catholic among those candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden, gets 51 percent of their vote, compared to 40 percent for Trump. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt) gets 50 percent compared to Trump's 41 percent. Latecomer Michael Bloomberg is favored by 48 percent of these Catholic voters, the same as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass).
In a year in which the presidential election numbers could be particularly tight, the stalwart nature of devout Catholic voters could prove significant. That's because 75 percent indicate they always vote in major elections. Among the general Catholic population, that number goes down to 58 percent.
Cannon had another important way to describe this 18 percent of Catholics who are particularly devout and active.
""A lot of them are what we used to call Reagan Democrats,"" he explained.
 
Where They Stand on Cultural & Moral Issues
Bunson said EWTN was particularly interested in taking part in this survey, ""To chart where Catholics stand right now on all the great questions politically we face as a country in this 2020 campaign.""
""We also wanted to find out where Catholics are not just politically, but where they stand in their faith lives,"" he said. ""And how the two then intersect in politics and how they form their consciences to vote, but also where they stand on the great cultural issues of the time and what we certainly see as the great moral issues of the time.""
The split among devout Catholics and others shows up in what they consider ""intrinsically evil"".
The poll shows 71 percent of devout Catholics say abortion is ""intrinsically evil"". Just 47 percent of the general Catholic population feel that way.
And 70 percent of the devout consider physician-assisted suicide ""intrinsically evil"", but only 41 percent of general Catholics do.
But when asked if something like abortion should always be illegal in all circumstances, the number plunges down to 23 percent.  
 
""Even the most devout Catholics take the separation of church and state pretty seriously,"" Cannon noted. ""They don't always just go with what their faith says. They grant some space to the political sphere to work out these issues.""
But all Catholics are much more united on whether hell and the devil both exist.  
 
""81 percent of Catholics believe in the existence of hell, 78 percent believe in the existence of the devil. Catholics by about 72 percent believe in what we term 'intrinsic evil,' that is something that is wrong in all circumstances,"" Bunson concluded.

Major media outlets cited anonymous sources last week who claimed that the Russians were working to boost the president. That's something both Trump and his team denied, including National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.
""I have not seen that, and I get pretty good access,"" O'Brien said. “I haven't seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump re-elected.”
Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said on Monday, ""The way it has been characterized in the media is just completely false. We had two officials from this administration, high ranking, to come out and say they were in the briefing and the allegations of what happened actually didn't occur at all.""
The fake news report came out of a hearing held by House Democrats.
""As far as these selective leaks are concerned, I just don't know how many more times Democrats can leak something selectively out of a committee. I don't know how many more times the media is going to fall for a lie from Adam Schiff or his staff before they just stop taking some of his quotes,"" Gidley continued.
The new reports say the intelligence briefer reportedly overstated Russia's actions, leaving out key elements.
Intelligence reports do say that Russia is trying to help Bernie Sanders campaign, although it's not clear how they might be doing that.
Gidley says the administration is working to make sure these 2020 elections are secure.
""No one's been tougher on Russia than this administration. What we've done to secure our elections, to make sure that every vote counts, every vote matters, is unprecedented. It was the Barack Obama administration who knew Russia was going to meddle and they did nothing. It was our administration that put a whole of government approach in place. We are now working with local governments, state, local levels, using FBI, DHS and others to ensure that those elections are protected. In fact, we're running tests in many states as well so that we can make sure that those devices they count votes on cannot be tampered with, cannot be meddled with."""

Bernie Sanders has taken a big leap forward in his bid to win the party's presidential nomination.
The Vermont senator blew out his competition in the Nevada Caucus Saturday and now party leaders are wondering if he can be stopped.
Sanders predicts he'll ride the momentum all the way to the White House. ""We're not only going to win here in Texas on Super Tuesday, we're going to beat Trump in November,"" he insisted at a Texas rally Sunday.

Sen. Bernie Sanders Celebrates Victory at Nevada Democratic Caucus
While the president may relish taking on the socialist Sanders as his opponent, the Democratic establishment is scared about the prospect of Bernie Sanders becoming their presidential nominee. 
And comments like the one Sanders made one on 60 Minutes about Fidel Castro and Cuba put him back in the headlines.
""It's unfair to simply say everything is bad, you know when Fidel Castro came into office you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program,"" insisted Sanders.
""I don't think he can beat Donald Trump and keep a Democratic Senate, get a Democratic Senate and keep a Democratic House,"" former Vice President Joe Biden explained. 
That concern has caused some Democrats running for Congress to distance themselves from Sanders and his socialist agenda - policies that are unlikely to win over voters in key congressional swing districts, including those that Democrats won in 2018, and more conservative states.
This Saturday, voters will be going to the polls again in South Carolina.
A new CBS News poll released Sunday shows Biden's lead in South Carolina narrowing over Sanders. Biden stands at 28 percent of likely Democrat voters and Sanders is now at 23 percent. Biden's lead has dwindled since last October when it stood at 43 percent.
The Democratic House Majority Whip, Congressman Jim Clyburn doubts Sanders can keep the Nevada victory momentum going in his state. ""This is South Carolina and South Carolinians are pretty leery about that title, socialist,"" Clyburn explained.
Biden is hoping Clyburn will endorse him for the Democratic presidential nomination. That could help Biden win support from undecided black voters.
If they turn out to the polls in large numbers, black voters could make the difference in the South Carolina primary vote.  
Touting his experience with the African American community, Biden made an appeal Sunday at a black church in North Charleston.
""You have in your hands the power unlike any time in a long time to determine who the next Democratic nominee will be,"" Biden said.
And even if Biden wins a narrow victory over Sanders in South Carolina Saturday, it may not be enough to slow Sanders down with the huge Super Tuesday primaries just three days after that. If Sanders wins a majority of those 14-states, there may be little that worrisome Democratic party leaders – or Sanders’ opponents like Biden and others – could do to stop him from rolling forward to the nomination.

Bernie Sanders Celebrates Victory at Nevada Democratic Caucus,"Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders has won the Democratic caucus in Nevada according to early projections of the voting there reported by multiple media outlets. 
Votes are still being counted, but Sanders reportedly has a sizable lead.
For decades Sanders has been calling for change in policies that address unevenness in politics and the economy. Most notably his ""Medicare for All"" health care plan that would replace the private insurance system with a government-run universal system.
""The idea of universal health care is not a radical idea. When we come together there is nothing we can't accomplish,"" Sanders declared.
""In Nevada, we have just put together a multi-generational, multi-racial coalition, which is going to not only win in Nevada, it's going to sweep this country,"" Sanders said at a rally in Texas, shortly after news outlets reported his caucus win.  
Former mayor of Sound Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, congratulated Sanders on his win, but warned Democrats about what Sanders' nomination could mean in congressional races.  
""We can prioritize either ideological purity or inclusive victory. We can either call people names online or we can call them into our movement. We can either tighten a narrow and hardcore base or open the tent to a new, broad, big-hearted American coalition,"" Buttigieg contended. 
Sanders is headed to South Carolina where his campaign will focus on Super Tuesday on March 3.
Former Vice President Joe Biden said he still has time to take action in the primary race with a win in the next challenge. 
""The press is ready to declare people dead quickly, but we're alive and we're coming back and we're going to win,"" Biden said. ""We're going to win in South Carolina. Then Super Tuesday, and we are on our way.""  
Next, candidates will face off at the South Carolina Democratic Debate which will be held at the Congressional Black Caucus Institute in Charleston, South Carolina, on Tuesday, February 25."

Voters can caucus only for the party that matches their voter registration, but they are allowed to both register or change party affiliations at their caucus or early-vote site.
Nevada Democrats avoided a repeat of the chaos that unfolded during the Iowa caucuses. 
Iowa's Democratic party leaders say it was due to a new app that had been designed to help the volunteers with reporting results. 
Democrats in Nevada modified their plan after Iowa but still relied on technology to assist in counting and reporting results.
The Nevada State Democratic Party tweeted, ""Caucuses are starting to be called to order! Thank you to the caucus-goers & volunteers who showed up today to make this the most transparent, expansive, and accessible caucus yet. #FirstInTheWest""
This is the third big contest for the presidential hopefuls. With Sen. Bernie Sanders pulling ahead after his win in New Hampshire, the other candidates are all fighting for a chance to score their own victory.
The candidate with possibly the most on the line is former Vice President Joe Biden after his poor showing in Iowa and New Hampshire. He's gone on the attack against front-runner Sanders, criticizing his health care plans.

Trump Targets New Russia Claims from Congress as DNI Post Unsettled,"Republican Congressman Doug Collins of Georgia says he fully supports President Trump, but he doesn't want to be his new director of national intelligence.
Trump is looking for a new DNI, and there were rumors that he was considering Collins for the post. It all comes amid new claims via the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives that Russia is trying to help Trump win the 2020 election.
The DNI oversees all the US intelligence agencies. The president was reportedly angry with the current acting-DNI after being told that intelligence officials had informed a congressional briefing that Russia was intervening in the election on Trump's side.
Trump has imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia and rejects claims that Russia is helping him.
""Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do-Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa. Hoax number 7!” Trump tweeted.
Bernie Sanders was briefed by US officials that Russia is trying to help his presidential campaign, according to The Washington Post. 
Meanwhile, the DNI’s chief election official, Shelby Pierson, told NPR that concerns about the elections aren't just about Russian interference. “We’re still also concerned about China, Iran, non-state actors, hacktivists and frankly - certainly for DHS and FBI - even Americans that might be looking to undermine confidence in the elections,” Pierson said.
Trump has appointed Richard Grenell as the acting-DNI but still doesn't have a permanent nominee for the post. Grenell is the current ambassador to Germany.
He explained in a previous interview with CBN News that he's not overly popular with Germany because of his staunch support of the president.
""In the short term, in the immediacy that changing the status quo is always messy, that people get comfortable and they don't want to change the status quo,"" he explained. ""So I've got good perspective. I'm a cancer survivor and I have to tell you when you wake up and you've defeated cancer and you're looking at life from a different way, bad media coverage or critical media coverage or complainers from the side, that doesn't bother me.""
Some conservatives support the Grenell appointment as a signal that the administration would be watching over, if not cleaning out, ""deep state"" intelligence officials who try to undermine the president."

This comes after a raucous NBC News debate Wednesday left Michael Bloomberg badly bruised in the eyes of many Democratic strategists.
Some party leaders hoped Bloomberg would emerge as an alternative to socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. Instead many Democrats called his performance pathetic saying he was ill-prepared to respond to attacks he knew would be launched from other candidates.
""We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who-knows-how-many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said about Bloomberg during the debate.
As the primary season continues with a full slate of candidates, the debate exposed deep fractures in the party, including on key issues like the economy and healthcare.
""I believe in democratic socialism for working people, not billionaires. Health care for all,"" Sen. Sanders said.
""We're not gonna throw out capitalism. We tried that, other countries tried that, it's called communism and it just didn't work,"" Bloomberg said as Senators Warren and Sanders moaned and quickly raised their hands hoping to respond.
""I'm actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sanders' personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his healthcare plan,"" quipped Pete Buttigieg.
And Joe Biden pointed out, ""I'm the guy the president turned to and said go get the votes for Obamacare. And I noticed what everybody's talking about is the plan that I first introduced."" 
While Democrats duke it out, a new Quinnipiac University poll shows a tight race in key swing states.
In Wisconsin, Trump leads all of the candidates, while in Pennsylvania and Michigan all of the Democratic candidates have an edge on the president.
In all three states voters say the economy is their most important issue followed by healthcare and climate change.
Following the contentious debate that damaged the Bloomberg brand, the president had a spring in his step during a packed campaign rally in Colorado Springs.
""I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate. It got very big ratings and you know what, mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do is it?"" Trump told his supporters.
""I became president because of the debates, because unlike mini Mike, I could answer questions,"" he continued.
After Nevada, candidates have a week to campaign for votes before the South Carolina primary a week from Saturday.

Newcomer Michael Bloomberg took most of the hits while frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) remained relatively unscathed.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was the most aggressive in her attacks against Bloomberg.
""I'd like to talk about who we're running against – a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians,"" she said. ""And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.""
The billionaire who's spent hundreds of millions of his own dollars on campaign ads hit back and pivoted to train his focus on President Trump.
""I am a New Yorker. I know how to take on an arrogant conman like Donald Trump,"" said Bloomberg.
He apologized for the controversial policy known as ""Stop and Frisk"" which he had defended as the mayor of New York City.
""I've sat, I've apologized, I've asked for forgiveness,"" Bloomberg explained. ""There is no great answer to a lot of these problems and if we took off everybody that was wrong on this – off this panel –  everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers, there would be nobody else up here.""
He also took hits over alleged discriminatory and sexist comments made to women who worked for him.
""We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against,"" said Warren.
Sanders Also Took Some Hits for His Socialist Agenda
Sanders, who's surging in national polls, also fielded a fair amount of attacks and had to defend his socialist healthcare and economic policies.
""I believe in democratic socialism for working people, not billionaires,"" said Sanders. ""Health care for all.""
Bloomberg was quick to point to the failure of socialism throughout history, and questioned the practicality of Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" policy.
""You don't start out by saying I've got 160 million people, I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love,"" said Bloomberg.
Pete Buttigieg took his attacks to both the frontrunner and newcomer.
""Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat,"" he said. ""Look, we shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out.""
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, clashed several times with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) once for not knowing the name of Mexico's president. ""Are you trying to say that I'm dumb or are you mocking me here, Pete?"" asked Klobuchar.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who's been steadily slipping in the polls, spent the night defending his record.
""I'm the only one on the stage that actually got anything done on health care,"" said Biden.
The Nevada caucus is Saturday but early voting has already taken place. From Nevada, the candidates head to South Carolina ahead of that state's primary and another debate.
Trump Says Election Is for 'the Survival of Our Nation'
Meanwhile, President Trump was also on the campaign trail Wednesday night in neighboring Arizona, blasting the Democrats while telling the enthusiastic crowd that the Republicans stand with the American people.
""The Democrat Party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American Dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right?"" he said.
The president added that this year's election is for ""the survival of our nation"".

In his second appearance this week, Bolton spoke Wednesday at Vanderbilt University, arguing that the House ""committed impeachment malpractice,"" saying ""it was so partisan.""
Democrats had demanded that Senate Republicans call on him to testify during the trial phase, but Bolton says it wouldn't have made any difference if he had testified. He said the Senate still would have acquitted the president.
""People can argue about what I should have said and what I should have done,"" Bolton said. ""I would bet you a dollar right here and now, my testimony would have made no difference to the ultimate outcome.""
Bolton is trying to publish a book about his time in the White House in which he reportedly accuses Trump of withholding military aid while seeking a corruption investigation from Ukraine. The book is being held up for a security review because the administration contends it could reveal classified information.
Earlier this week, Bolton spoke publicly for the first time since the impeachment trial. At Duke University Monday night, he accused the White House of censoring his upcoming book in which he reportedly alleges Trump was directly tied to the pressure campaign on Ukraine.
 
""There are portions of the manuscript that deal with Ukraine, I view that like the sprinkles on the ice cream sundae, meaning, in terms of what's in the book,"" he said. ""This is in an effort to write history and I did it the best I can.""  
Bolton criticized the president for not being tough enough on Russia and called the meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un a ""failure"". He also argues that the Trump administration's approach to Iran is failing."

An administration official, speaking anonymously, said that Barr ""has his limits,"" The Washington Post reported.
That report suggested that Barr wanted Trump to ""get the message"" to stop weighing in publicly with ongoing criminal cases. Another administration official gave a similar admission on Barr. 
But DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec tweeted, ""Addressing Beltway rumors: The Attorney General has no plans to resign.""
The news that Barr might resign came days after he spoke out saying the president's tweets made it ""impossible"" for him to do his job.
""To have public statements and tweets about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department, about judges before whom we have cases,"" Barr said, makes it ""impossible for me to do my job and to ensure the courts and the prosecutors and department that we're doing our work with integrity.""
Trump insisted he has a ""legal right"" to intervene in criminal cases but also says he knows he sometimes makes things difficult for Barr.
""I do make his (Attorney General Bill Barr's) job harder, I do agree with that. I think that's true,"" Trump said. ""He's a very straight shooter. We have a great Attorney General."" 
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said, ""The President wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right, just like any other American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions.""
""President Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people, against injustices in our country, including the fake news. The President has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law,"" Grisham added.
But President Trump insists that he has a ""legal right"" to voice his concerns on criminal cases, saying, ""I'm allowed to be totally involved. I am actually I guess the chief law enforcement officer of the country.""
  
Barr also denied that the president ever asked him to do anything in a criminal case.
The president caused more controversy on Tuesday after announcing the pardons and commutations for 11 people.
Most notably, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagoyovich, who was serving a 14-year sentence for trying to auction off Barack Obama's Senate seat.
The president told reporters before boarding Air Force One that he had commuted the sentence of Blagojevich, noting he had seen Blagojevich's wife advocate for him on television and had met him many years ago when the Democrat ex-governor had appeared on ""Celebrity Apprentice.""
""He'll be able to go back to his family after serving eight years in jail, which was a powerful and ridiculous sentence in my opinion,"" Trump said.

The organization came to Richmond on Tuesday, sounding the alarm over three main bills quickly making their way through the legislature that they believe represents a weaponizing of the government against the church.  
Two of the bills outlaw discrimination in public places based on factors such as gender and sexual orientation. If they become law, it could have serious implications for an all-boys Christian school and similar organizations.  
 
""The laws being proposed, really at the end of the day, are going to hurt freedom of speech and freedom of religion to express one's religion and religious convictions,"" said Gerson Morena-Riano, executive vice president of academic affairs at Regent University.

Separate boys' and girls' restrooms could also become a thing of the past if the Democratic majority has its way. A third bill would prohibit hiring and firing practices based on gender or sexual orientation.  Think about churches that only have male priests or a convent with all-female nuns.  
 
""This is the first time that we've ever seen something that affects quote unquote public accommodations which is very vaguely defined and goes to anything that is essentially open to the public,"" Cobb said.
Opponents of the bills say the very rules meant to thwart discrimination would in fact heap it on them.

""To argue that the attorney general, the chief law enforcement officer of the state of Virginia, could initiate civil actions based on what he or she may think is happening or what could happen - again very, very scary,"" Moreno-Riano said.
The Family Foundation will push for amendments to the bills to protect faith-based entities. If the bills pass the legislature as is, they'll appeal to the governor to make the changes. If that fails, Cobb said, a lawsuit would be the next step.

Some say Trump's clemency to Blagojevich is without merit.
Prosecutors have refuted the idea long argued by Blagojevich that he was engaged in common political horse-trading and was a victim of an overzealous U.S. attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald said after Blagojevich's arrest that the governor had gone on ""a political corruption crime spree"" that would make Abraham Lincoln turn over in his grave.
The former governor had exhausted his last legal appeal. He was set to be released in 2024. "

In many parts of Virginia such as the southwest region, the Shenandoah Valley and beyond, residents have more in common with their neighbors over the mountains in West Virginia than they have with folks in other parts of their state and now they have an invitation to join them.
""What originally started as moral support has morphed into something much more,"" West Virginia state Delegate Gary Howell (R) tells CBN News.
He's inviting his disaffected neighbors to cross the line and switch sides so to speak.
""We see that kindred spirit on the other side of the mountains and that's why we want to give that help to our fellow Virginians. They're just like us,"" he continues.
He's behind a resolution that would allow Virginia localities, with permission of their local and state governments, plus approval by West Virginia voters, to join the Mountaineer state. Any locality can join, not just those along the state border. Howell says they would simply become ""islands of West Virginia.""
The new Democratic majority in Virginia's legislature is churning out a slew of new laws on gun control, abortion, and special LGBT protections that many worry will negatively affect church-run ministries. Many longtime Virginians no longer recognize their state.
When asked if he's had any takers, Howell says Virginia counties are reaching out to him.
""Vexit"" or the Virginia exit has shown up on at least one board of supervisors' agenda, and other localities are reportedly interested too.
Howell is fielding practical questions about whether or not professional licenses would transfer.
""We've looked at integrating state police, highways, the retirement system,"" he explains.
Even West Virginia's governor is on board.
""If you're not truly happy where you are – we stand with open arms to take you from Virginia or anywhere you may be – we stand strongly behind the Second Amendment and we stand strongly for the unborn,"" Gov. Jim Justice said during a recent press conference in Martinsburg with Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr.
Justice, who dramatically changed his party affiliation to Republican at a Trump rally, says his state offers beauty, a growing economy, and a state motto many Virginians may find appealing – ""Mountaineers are always free.""
""Richmond has a habit of upsetting the counties to the west and it's a pattern for Richmond,"" Howell says.
West Virginia split from Virginia in 1863 over disagreements about the Civil War.
""Somebody asked me, do you think this is the beginning of the next Civil War? And I said, no, this is what prevents it,"" Howell says confidently.
Every ten years legislative lines are redrawn, and Del. Howell suggests it's time to look at state boundaries – some of which are hundreds of years old and may no longer make sense."

The billionaire qualified for the debate at the last minute after gaining enough support, breaking into double digits in four national polls to make the cut.
In an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey, Bloomberg moved ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden, putting him in second place behind Sen. Bernie Sanders.

That national poll lists Sanders with 31 percent of support, up from 22 percent in December.
It shows Bloomberg spiking up to 19 percent from just 4 percent in December.
It shows former Vice President Joe Biden with 15 percent of support, dropping 9 points since December.
Even though he hasn't been officially running in the Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada contests, Bloomberg has already spent more than $400 million on advertising with the aim of making a big splash on Super Tuesday.
The socialist Sanders blasted the billionaire for spending so much money, saying, ""He thinks he can buy this election. Well, I got news for Mr. Bloomberg, and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections.""
""So today we say to those billionaires who are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to support candidates who represent the rich and the powerful, today we say to Mayor Bloomberg, we are a democracy, not an oligarchy. You're not going to buy this election,"" Sanders said.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) will likely be happy to have Bloomberg in the Las Vegas debate after saying recently, ""I can't beat him on the airwaves, but I can beat him on the debate stage.""
Meanwhile, the Drudge Report said this weekend that Bloomberg was considering Hillary Clinton as a running mate - a report that the Bloomberg campaign did not confirm nor deny.
Now he's facing growing criticism from other Democratic presidential candidates, as well as questions based on past remarks over women, minorities and other issues.
Right now, Sanders has a solid lead in Nevada heading into the state's caucus vote. The Nevada caucus takes place Feb. 22, followed by the South Carolina Democratic primaries on Feb. 29.
The biggest event for Democrats comes on Super Tuesday, March 3, with primaries in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.

This is the third big contest for the candidates, and with Sen. Bernie Sanders pulling ahead after his win in New Hampshire, the other candidates are all fighting for a chance to score their own victory.
The candidate with possibly the most on the line is former Vice President Joe Biden after his poor showing in Iowa and New Hampshire. He's gone on the attack against socialist front-runner Sanders, criticizing his health care plans.

""He's been talking about health care, 'Medicare for all', universal health care for 35 years,"" Biden said. ""Nothing has happened. I helped get passed Obamacare."" 
Sanders and other Democratic candidates have another target - multi-billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Even though he isn't running in Nevada, he has been rising in the polls as he invests heavily in campaign ads, hoping for a big score in the later contests.
""He thinks he can buy this election. Well, I got news for Mr. Bloomberg, and that is the American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections,"" Sanders said. 
Speaking with NBC News on Meet the Press on Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said Bloomberg cannot continue to hide behind the airwaves. 
""He is running more ads on whatever he wants. I think what needs to happen is that he needs to go on shows - which he hasn't done,"" she said. ""He just can't hide behind the airwaves. He has to answer questions and I think he should be on that debate stage, which eventually he will be.""
""I can't beat him on the airwaves, but I can beat him on the debate stage,"" Klobuchar added.
The Drudge Report said this weekend that Bloomberg was considering Hillary Clinton as a running mate - a report that the Bloomberg campaign did not confirm nor deny.
Shortly after Drudge reported the news, Bloomberg tweeted a random message touting that he supports women in the workplace.
    
In Nevada, early voting is underway. At one caucus site at the East Las Vegas Library, voters waited in line for up to 40 minutes on Saturday morning. 
The state Democratic Party tweeted that early voting is going well: ""We are very excited to share that as of 5:00 p.m., we had more than 11,800 Nevada Democrats participate in the first day of our historic four-day early vote period!""
After the Iowa caucus vote-counting debacle, all eyes are on Nevada's caucus to see if similar problems will arise. Democrats there have ditched the problematic app that undermined the vote in Iowa, but there are still reports that Democrats are nervous that a proper replacement system hasn't been worked out yet.
""We have been banned from using the 'app' word, but nobody has told us what a tool is exactly what or how we'll do it,"" caucus site leader Seth Morrison told ABC News. 
It has since been revealed that the state party will use a ""caucus calculator"" to aid in tallying the voting data for each precinct. Nevada's ""calculator"" is supposed to help figure out some of the more complicated caucus math.
""It feels like the (state party is) making it up as they go along,"" a Democratic presidential aide told the Washington Post. ""That's not how we need to be running an election.""
""If the party had this process well-defined and had confidence in it, I think that we'd know a lot more about it,"" another Democratic aide said.
Meanwhile, Iowa's Democratic Party leaders say it wasn't a hack or an intrusion that caused so much chaos earlier this month. There were more concerns about ""quality checks"" and ""inconsistencies,"" blaming the new app that was designed to help the reporting.
The calculator used in Nevada will have a built-in caucus math formula to calculate totals for the precinct chairs. They are not required to use the calculator, simply replacing it with paper worksheets.
The Nevada caucus takes place Feb. 22, followed by the South Carolina Democratic primaries on Feb. 29.

The Washington and Lee University mock convention projects Sen. Bernie Sanders will win the top prize, but not until the last minute.
Students project Sanders will enter the national convention just shy of enough delegates to secure the nomination. Due to the crowded field of moderates, they think he'll win enough delegates on a second ballot.
This quadrennial student-run event has a time tested and reliable reputation. W&L held its first mock convention in 1908. Since then students have correctly predicted the nominee 20 out of 26 tries.

Students run every aspect of the event as they focus on the party out of power in the White House.
""And then we also write a platform so it's not just predicting a nominee, it's predicting the whole convention pretty much,"" says Kaitlyn Brock, a graduating senior who was responsible for managing the event's $1 million budget.
In 2016, students successfully predicted Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination, but this year has presented unique challenges.
""With Bloomberg entering the race late and just recently having his vast investment into campaign infrastructure start to really begin to show signs of success, as well as Biden's fall in Iowa and New Hampshire things, are a lot less sure,"" says Wes Culp.
He's on the political team that analyzes and adds up months of research compiled by student state chairs.
""We have not left a single stone unturned,"" Culp says.
The complex process of figuring it all out is eye-opening for students.
""It's been really fun to get politically active, because I'm not politically active, and learn something or two. I'll be the first person in my family to vote ever in the states, I'm a daughter of immigrants, so that's been really exciting to kind of just learn and do it in a really fun way with my friends,"" Ayo Ehindero tells CBN News.
""It's been a unique experience where I've been able to kind of dive in and try to figure out everything that I believe in,"" says Harrison Travis who served on the Tennessee delegations.
""Our slogan is 'United to Predict' and I think especially, a lot of times, there's always news about how divided the country is. I think this organization is so great because it brings everyone on our campus together. We have over 98 percent of the student body involved,"" says Brock.
So, did they get it right? Now it's onward to Nevada, South Carolina, Super Tuesday and beyond to find out.

Barr was speaking about the president's tweets in connection with the Roger Stone case.
US prosecutors in the case had recommended a 7- to 9-year sentence for Stone after convictions on lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction in connection with the Mueller probe.
The Justice Department overruled that recommendation, saying the sentence ""would not be appropriate."" Then four US prosecutors withdrew from the Roger Stone case after the milder sentencing recommendation. That raised questions as to whether the attorney general intervened on behalf of Stone, who is the president's acquaintance, especially in light of a presidential tweet calling the recommended sentence a ""miscarriage of justice.""

The president also tweeted: “Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought.” 
Speaking to ABC News, the attorney general said he made the decision on his own, before any tweets came out.
""I had made a decision that I thought was fair and reasonable in this particular case and once the tweet occurred, the question is, 'Well, now what do I do?' And do you go forward with what you think is the right decision or do you pull back because of the tweet? And that just sort of illustrates how disruptive these tweets can be,"" Barr explained.
He also said, ""I have a problem with some of, some of the tweets. The president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case. However, having public statements and tweets made about the department, about our people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we're doing our work with integrity."" 
Now House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling the incident another presidential 'abuse of power' that should be investigated by Congress. 
""This is an abuse of power that the president is again trying to manipulate federal law enforcement to serve his political interests. And the president is what he is, he thinks he's above the law,"" Pelosi charged, further calling it a ""blatant violation of the rule of law"". 
A new tweet by President Trump could add further fuel to Democrats' threats to investigate him on the matter. Trump tweeted Friday: "" 'The President has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.' - A.G. Barr  This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!""

His statement about having the right to intervene in criminal cases is what's causing another outcry from critics.
Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said everything is ok between Trump and Barr.
""The president wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right, just like any American citizen to publicly offer his opinions,"" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. ""The president has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law.""

The Trump team is shattering fundraising records and they're reportedly on a path toward a goal of raising $1 billion in this political cycle.
RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, “We already have 500,000 volunteers trained and activated, and this record-breaking support is helping us grow our grassroots army even more.” 
The pro-Trump effort said it has gained more than 1 million new digital and direct mail donors since Democrats launched their push to impeach Trump in September 2019. 
The money raised in January coincided with most of the Senate's impeachment trial which resulted in the president's acquittal earlier this month. =
The Trump team's haul and cash on hand were twice that of former President Barack Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee at the same point ahead of his 2012 reelection, the AP reported. 
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party appears to be facing a bit of financial trouble. 
Whoever wins the Democratic primaries will encounter a big financial hurdle they will have to quickly overcome. The party is $6.5 million in debt. President Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised more money than Democrats by over 6 to 1. Last year alone, Trump and the RNC together pulled in more than $600 million.
Among the candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), reported raising $25-plus million in January alone. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said she raised more than $6 million in just a few days after last week's debate in New Hampshire, while former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported collecting $4 million in four days following the Iowa caucus. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who finished worse than Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Iowa and New Hampshire, is still seeing donations roll in. His campaign reports raising $4.5 million since the start of the month."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the upcoming June Democratic primary, including a pastor who considers himself socially conservative. 
Fernando Cabrera has served as a New York City councilman representing the city's 14th District for more than a decade, and he's among the five Democrats running. Cabrera, 55, doesn't live in New York's 14th congressional district but decided to take a longshot run for Ocasio-Cortez's job anyway. He said he used to live in the district in Throggs Neck. 
Cabrera maintains that Ocasio-Cortez's rhetoric and embrace of socialism are out of sync with voters in the district, according to the Daily News.

Roughly half of the district is of Hispanic or Latino heritage, making it one of the more Latino districts in New York. 
The New York Times has described the district as among the bluest in the nation. In the 2016 presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton outpaced Republican Donald Trump 77 percent to 20 percent.  In 2012, then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat, took 81 percent of the vote, while former Utah Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, had 18 percent. 
But Cabrera contends that, in one sense, ""This district is a moderate district."" He told the Daily News, ""If you look at almost every Council member representing that area, they're moderates and conservatives.""
Cabrera also serves as the founder and senior pastor of New Life Outreach International Church in the Bronx. According to the church's website, he attended Southern California College. He holds a Master's degree from Liberty University and a Ph.D. in Counseling from Argosy University. He started the New Life ministry in 1988.
Ocasio-Cortez, 30, has used her social media savvy to drum up supporters along with campaign cash.  Last year, she raised more than $5.3 million with more than $2.9 million cash on hand. The congresswoman shot to fame as a polarizing figure for far-left issues after defeating 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in the 2018 primary and then went on to win the general election. 
Although some political analysts see any challenge against Ocasio-Cortez as a longshot, several candidates have already filed their paperwork with the federal election board to run against her.
As CBN News reported, the latest challenger is former CNBC anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.  She filed her paperwork on Monday. 
Eight Republicans will also battle for the opportunity to fight for that seat in the general election this fall. "

It's a last-ditch effort by Democrats to get the controversial amendment added to the Constitution.
""With this resolution, we take a giant step toward equality for women, progress for families, and a stronger America,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told ERA supporters.
 
The Equal Rights Amendment, which says, ""equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex,"" passed Congress in 1972.
 
However, it expired decades ago. The ERA failed to get the approval needed from 38 states, the three-fourths required to amend the US Constitution, before its 1979 and extended-1982 deadlines passed.
 
Also, a number of states that did ratify the ERA later rescinded their approval.
 
""It is time to guarantee true equality under the United States Constitution,"" Virginia state Delegate Hala Ayala (D) said during floor debate on the floor of the Virginia House of Delegates last month.
 
Despite the expired deadline, Virginia revived the debate in January when it became the 38th state to ratify. 
 
The commonwealth's first female speaker of the House ensured the ERA was the first bill to pass out of her chamber.
 
""For the women of Virginia and the women of America, the resolution has finally passed,"" Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn (D) said after members voted along party lines to ratify the amendment.
""We will no longer suffer in silence as we are discriminated against. We will not stand by while being paid less, we won't keep quiet about violence perpetrated against women with impunity,"" argued Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy (D).
 
However, critics say the ERA is the opposite of what it claims. They say it actually harms women and mandates abortion on demand.
 
""This is about breaking down any prohibitions in any state against abortion, this is really about creating the inevitability on a federal level for abortion to be legal, any reason, any number, all paid for by the taxpayer,"" Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America explained on CBN's Faith Nation.
 
In addition, Nance says there are 800 gender-specific laws designed to protect women, like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, that would disappear under the ERA.
 
""Do we deserve special protection in certain areas because biologically we need them or should those all end?"" Nance asked.
 
While Democrats work to revive the amendment, liberal icon, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg says the ERA is dead.
 
She encourages supporters to start over in Congress.
 
It's unlikely a new ERA as written would pass the Senate. Getting three-fourths of states to ratify it would be a challenge too, but this fight is far from over.

Pro-Life Democrats Keep Asking Their Presidential Candidates, Only One Says 'Yes'","ABOVE: Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life of America appeared on Wednesday's edition of CBN News' Faith Nation to talk about how the Democratic Party's platform has gotten to a point where there's no room for pro-life Democrats. Faith Nation is seen weeknights on the CBN News Channel.  For a programming schedule, click here.
Pro-life Democrats are working to find a place in the party as Democratic presidential candidates like New Hampshire primary winner Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and runner-up former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) tell voters to make no mistake, Democrats are pro-choice.
During an Iowa town hall last month, Democrats for Life of America Executive Director Kristen Day asked Buttigieg if he would allow pro-life Democrats into the party.
""I respect where you're coming from, and I hope to earn your vote, but I'm not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you. I am pro-choice,"" Buttigieg said.
""I know that the difference of opinion that you and I have is one that we have come by honestly and the best that I can offer, and it may win your vote and if not, I understand — if we can't agree on where to draw the line, the next best thing we can do is agree on who should draw the line, and in my view, it's the woman who's faced with that decision,"" he said.
During an MSNBC televised town hall on abortion rights, Sanders made his opinion on the subject very clear.
""Is there such a thing as a pro-life Democrat in your vision of the party?"" asked host, Stephanie Ruhle.
""By this time in history . . . when we talk about what a Democrat is, I think being pro-choice is an essential part of that,"" he said.
However, that assessment is in stark contrast to the opinion of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) who on Tuesday said there is room the party for pro-life proponents.
""I am strongly pro-choice. I have always been pro-choice, but I believe we're a big tent party and there are pro-life Democrats and they are part of our party,"" she said. ""And I think we need to build a big tent. I think we need to bring people in instead of shutting them out.""
Appearing on CBN News' Faith Nation Wednesday, Day said the Democratic Party platform does not allow room for people who are pro-life.
""There absolutely should be,"" Day said. ""But the problem is, the platform has gotten to a point where there's no room for people like me, because it (the platform) says there's an unequivocal support for abortion. Up to nine months and taxpayers will pay for it.""
""We were successful in prior platform processes to get language that was more inclusive and that left room for pro-life Democrats,"" she explained. ""But this current language that was passed in 2016 leaves no room. And so right now, there's an opportunity to rewrite that platform language. We rewrite it every four years, so we're really pushing for that language to be changed and to make it inclusive fo people like me.""
Day told CBN News Buttigieg's response to her question last month was interesting even though she didn't ask him about his stance on abortion.
""I think the most interesting thing about his answer was, he was speaking about his position on abortion. But that's not what I asked. I never asked where he stood on the issue itself because clearly I knew where he stood,"" Day explained. ""I knew he was pro-choice. I knew he supported abortion rights. That wasn't the question.
“The question was, 'Does he think there's room for people like me and Gov. John Bell Edwards and all of these pro-life Democrats around the country? And would he entertain rewriting the platform language to make it more inclusive for everybody?' And the answer appeared to be 'no,'"" Day said.
Day explained the shift to abortion rights has been gradually worse with every Democratic platform written since 1976 when it was first introduced into the platform.
""We had success in President Obama's first term in adding language that focused more on support for pregnant women, giving women more choices other than abortion. And trying to reduce abortion in America,"" she noted. ""We added that language, but the abortion industry was so upset that they added 'unequivocal support for abortion' in the Democratic platform and that has stayed there since then.""
""It's unequivocal, so there's no question as to where the Democratic Party stands on it,"" Day added. ""So it's gradually gotten worse and worse, and I think we're at a point now where we have to make a stand and say, 'Either you are a big tent party that will include people like me or you aren't.' 
""So I think this is an important election for pro-life Democrats, particularly to let their voices be heard,"" she continued. ""Ask the candidates the question, where they stand on abortion and do they think there's room in the party for people who don't necessarily think abortion should be anything to be celebrated.""
When asked about Sen. Klobuchar's response to pro-life Democrats, Day said it's a step in the right direction, but again, they are only words.
""What steps will she take to make those words be true?"" she asked. ""There has to be some steps taken to clearly layout a space for pro-life Democrats to vote their conscience on this issue."""

But now that President Trump's acquittal has led to record approval ratings, that strategy might be backfiring. 
""I can tell you in all of our competitive Senate races they're in better shape today than they were a month ago,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters recently.
Not one of the GOP senators facing a tough re-election in 2020 voted to impeach Trump. Republicans are counting on impeachment fatigue to help them hang on to those Senate seats and possibly gain enough votes to flip the majority in the House of Representatives.  
""I don't like Trump but I didn't like the impeachment,"" Neal Jefferis of Virginia Beach, Va., told CBN News. ""I think it was wrong. I think Trump is an arrogant fool the way he conducts himself, but I don't think he did anything that should've been impeached.""
Republicans are specifically targeting districts like Virginia's 2nd District. Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA), where Jefferis lives, who was one of seven freshman Democrats who wrote The Washington Post op-ed about impeachment almost guaranteeing hearings would get a green light.
""I don't think we should've wasted the time doing the impeachment, we have more important business like passing budgets which is the job of Congress,"" continued Jefferis.
Other non-Trump voters in Luria's district questioned her vote to impeach Trump on both articles.
""A lot of us didn't think that was appropriate,"" Emily Haulenbeek told CBN News. ""I don't know that I necessarily voted for Trump but I also don't know that what was going on was something that a lot of other politicians aren't involved in as well.""
Aaron Baldwin agreed.
""As far as his impeachment goes, I feel like every candidate has something that they did that was not legal to get to where they're at,"" said Baldwin. ""I feel like all either side cares about is ensuring the other side loses, they don't really push their values they just push beating the other side.""
""When mom and dad fight the kids lose, which is kind of how I feel like things are,"" he continued.  
But other VA-2 voters like Robert Ryner support Luria's vote. ""Personally I think impeachment should have went through,"" said Ryner.
Meanwhile, the Democratic leadership stands by the impeachment.
""We have no regrets for standing up for truth and the Constitution and impeachment, but that has never slowed us down from our work,"" Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), vice-chair of the House Democratic Caucus, told CBN News.
The big question is this: Will the impeachment still be top of mind for voters eight months from now? "

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in the upcoming Democratic primaries.
Michelle Caruso-Cabrera filed her paperwork with the Federal Election Commission Monday and becomes the fifth Democrat to challenge the high-profile congresswoman in the June 23 primary for New York's 14th District. Eight Republicans will also battle for the opportunity to fight for that seat in the general election this fall. 
""I am the daughter and granddaughter of working-class Italian and Cuban immigrants,"" Caruso-Cabrera told CNBC in a statement. ""I am so lucky to have had such a wonderful career, and I want everybody to have the opportunity that I've had. That's why I'm running.""
CNBC said Caruso-Cabrera will take a leave of absence from her contributor role at the network. She left her full-time anchor position there two years ago. 
While running as a Democrat, Caruso-Cabrera has shown signs of being conflicted about her political sympathies.
In her book You Know I'm Right: More Prosperity, Less Government, published in 2010, the former news anchor called herself part of the growing crowd of ""sort-of"" Republicans.
""I am too fiscally responsible to want to reach out and hug the Democrats. Their social spending will keep the next several generations laden with debt,"" Caruso-Cabrera wrote. ""At the same time, I am too fiercely independent to embrace the Republican Party, because I want people to be free to make their choices about their personal lives.""  
Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is the youngest woman to be elected to Congress. As an advocate for far left policies, the congresswoman has become a polarizing figure in American politics. With 6.3 million Twitter followers and a group of supporters, she raised more than $5.3 million last year with more than $2.9 million cash on hand. 
Her New York district is among the bluest in the nation, according to The New York Times. Ocasio-Cortez upset 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in the 2018 primary and went on to win the general election. 
Since then, she has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democrat's left flank, calling for a ""Green New Deal"" and the elimination of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency."

Kyle Kondik, the managing editor for Sabato's Crystal Ball, published by the UVA Center for Politics, compared Trump's percentage of the vote to the stats for previous incumbent presidents.
""Trump at 84% in GOP primary so far -- last four reelected presidents (Reagan/Clinton/Bush/Obama) got between roughly 80%-85% in NH in reelection year,"" Kondik wrote in a tweet. 
He also shared a graph showing the history of the last 12 presidents and what percentage they received of New Hampshire voters in an election year. 
""In the primary's modern history, incumbents who won easy victories went on to renomination and reelection, while those who struggled lost in the fall or didn't run again,"" Kondik wrote in an article from 2019. 
Since Trump wasn't facing a serious challenge to his bid in the Granite State, that's partly why political observers are saying his voter turnout was also impressive. His turnout stats point to very enthusiastic support among his base.
RedState.com points out that Trump's turnout in New Hampshire was also substantial when compared to President Obama's turnout while running for his second term: ""Trump has 114,466 without even the final numbers in yet, with 84 percent of the vote in. He more than doubled Obama, the most recent past president.""
On the other side, Democrats are cheering about their voter turnout in New Hampshire after seeing lackluster turnout in Iowa.
The 2008 New Hampshire primary brought out 287,000 voters, and the 2020 primary just brought out a similar number. But the National Review's Jim Geraghty says the state actually has 78,000 more voters who were eligible to vote in this Democrat primary, so he thinks the number may not have been as significant.
Still, the Granite State's primary appears to indicate both sides are pretty fired up about the 2020 presidential race."

But coming in at close second and third are Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.
The Democrats are a party deeply divided. In a contest where most Democratic voters said they're looking for someone who can beat Donald Trump, Sanders narrowly took the top slot. ""This victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump,"" Sanders told his supporters.
But Buttigieg's strong second-place showing makes him a popular alternative for voters who see Sanders' socialist policies as too extreme. ""A campaign that some said shouldn't be here at all has shown that we are here to stay,"" Buttigieg said.

New Hampshire Voters Head to Polls as National Poll Shows Sanders Taking Lead from Biden
Buttigieg and Sanders split the New Hampshire delegates, giving Buttigieg a slight delegate lead after his Iowa victory.
 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar - who is also seen as a moderate - took a surprisingly strong third-place finish, getting a big boost from her debate performance last week.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, once frontrunners, both finished with single-digit support.  
With 87% of precincts reporting, here were the results:
Bernie Sanders,  71,759 - 26 percent
Pete Buttigieg,  68,141 - 24 percent
Amy Klobuchar,  55,164 - 20 percent
Elizabeth Warren,  25,899 - 9 percent
Joe Biden,  23,475 - 8 percent
Biden left the state early to get to South Carolina where he hopes for a big win among black voters to keep him in the race. ""Now where I come from, that's the opening bell, not the closing bell,"" he said.
Meanwhile, candidates Andrew Yang and Sen. Michael Bennett dropped out of the race Tuesday night after earning very little support.
After spending $200 million on TV ads, Michael Bloomberg is gaining ground in national polls, but he's not on the ballot until Super Tuesday. 
Bloomberg is facing new criticism after a recording from 2015 surfaced in which he defends his controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy in minority communities when he was New York mayor. Bloomberg apologized for the policy months ago, just days before launching his presidential campaign.
The political spotlight quickly shifts to Nevada, where Democrats will hold caucuses on Feb. 22. But the candidates will be barnstorming several states in the days leading up to Super Tuesday on March 3. "

Michael Bennet ended his long-shot presidential bid Tuesday, failing to break out of a crowded Democratic field dominated by other moderate candidates, including Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar.
Bennet, 55, was a late entrant to the race who staked his bid largely on trying to win New Hampshire. He only formally announced his candidacy in late April, after completing treatment for prostate cancer. He was the seventh senator and second white Colorado moderate to join the field, which made it difficult for him to stand out. 
Bennet ran on a centrist platform and made a point of bucking the trend among some candidates for splashy, liberal proposals. Instead of embracing ""Medicare for All"" and free college, Bennet ran on what he called his ""Real Deal"" platform of more modest but still ambitious goals. Those included annual payments of at least $3,000 to families with children under age 18, allowing people to buy into an expanded form of Medicare and a $1 trillion housing affordability plan.

Yang, Who Created Buzz with Freedom Dividend, Ends 2020 Bid
But while his articulate and passionate centrism won plaudits from pundits and experienced Democratic professionals, Bennet struggled to register in the polls and he hovered in the bottom tier of the field even as he campaigned more in New Hampshire than other candidates, with 50 town halls in the final ten weeks.. After July, Bennet never polled high enough or raised enough money to qualify for the debate stage again.
  
The main obstacle to Bennet was Biden, who as the moderate with establishment backing took up the space that the Colorado senator's campaign was counting on. Bennet's late entry also hobbled him. Because of his cancer diagnosis, he had to delay his candidacy, and he barely qualified for the first presidential debate. Bennet quickly began pushing back against the Democratic National Committee's increasingly stringent debate qualification rules, complaining it was an unfair advantage for the staples of cable television who had been campaigning months, or even years, earlier.
  
In the end, he staked his bet on the path blazed by his political mentor, former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, who scored a surprise win in New Hampshire in 1984 Democratic presidential primary and almost won the nomination. Bennet pledged to hold 50 town halls in New Hampshire during the final weeks of the campaign and spent almost every spare moment there.

His national press secretary, Erick Sanchez, confirmed the decision. It came as he expected a poor performance in New Hampshire's primary.
The 45-year-old was one of the breakout stars of the Democratic primary race, building a following that started largely online but expanded to give him enough donors and polling numbers to qualify for the first six debates.

Bennet Ends 2020 Bid after Poor Showing in New Hampshire
He outlasted senators and governors, and after initially self-funding his campaign, he raised more money than most of his rivals, bringing in over $16 million in the final quarter of last year. It was a bigger haul than all but the top four candidates: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Yang grew his outsider candidacy by campaigning as a non-politician, someone who mixed unconventional campaign events - from bowling to ax throwing - with serious talk about the millions of jobs lost to automation and artificial intelligence and the dark outlook for American jobs and communities. 
The graduate of Brown University and Columbia Law School gave campaign speeches full of statistics and studies that often resembled an economics seminar. His supporters, known as the Yang Gang, donned blue hats and pins with the word MATH - short for his slogan Make America Think Harder. 
Yang promoted his signature issue of universal basic income, which he dubbed the “freedom dividend,” by announcing during a debate that he would choose individuals to receive the monthly $1,000 checks. The statement prompted questions about whether he was trying to buy votes, but also generated a buzz online and helped the campaign build a list of possible supporters.
His poll numbers were high enough, combined with his fundraising strength, to qualify for him for all of the 2019 debates, though he fell short of Democratic National Committee's qualifications to participate in the January debate in Iowa. He qualified for the February debate in New Hampshire. 
Yang spent most of January in the leadoff caucus state, including a 17-day bus tour during which he told voters his finish in Iowa would “shock the world.”

But it turns out their idea is already facing a stark rejection from a leading liberal justice on the US Supreme Court.
The House Rules Committee met Monday night to consider a resolution that attempts to remove the deadline for states to ratify the ERA - a deadline that expired decades ago. The full House is expected to vote on it Thursday.
If approved by the Senate this would theoretically allow the amendment, known as the ERA, to be added to the US Constitution now that Virginia became the 38th state to ratify it.

Justice Dept. Says 1972 Equal Rights Amendment Is Dead, 'States and Congress Cannot Resurrect It'
Is the Equal Rights Amendment Actually 'a Trojan Horse for Taxpayer-Funded Abortion'?
But many legal experts and critics say this latest effort by Democrats won't fly.
Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation of Virginia, tells CBN News, ""Certainly we don't think amendments can work in perpetuity. That we can propose something in the 70's and it can be valid in 2020. So we are concerned about Congress's actions, but we know that the courts should be able to stand strong on how our founders intended us to ratify an amendment to the US Constitution.""
Cobb and other critics believe women already enjoy equal rights protections under the Constitution.
And it turns out that liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg thinks what the Democrats are trying to do is already moot. Ginsburg had been a supporter of the ERA, but it sounds like she agrees the deadline has passed, and that's something that can't be undone.
She said Virginia Democrats' attempt to push the ERA across the threshold has come too late, ""long after the deadline passed.""
""I would like to see a new beginning,"" CNN reports Ginsburg telling a Georgetown University Law Center audience on Monday night. ""I'd like it to start over.""

Sanders, a Democratic socialist, held a rock concert rally in New Hampshire Monday. The senator from neighboring Vermont easily won New Hampshire four years ago. The latest polls show history could repeat itself.
""If we win here tomorrow, I think we got a path to victory for the Democratic nomination,"" Sanders said.
Biden dropped dramatically after faring poorly in Iowa. He has low expectations in the Granite State and is trying to look past New Hampshire.
""Stick with me 24 more hours. And I promise you, we're gonna do just fine,"" he said.
On CBN's Faith Nation, chief political correspondent David Brody weighed in on Biden's campaign.
""He knows he's not gonna do well in New Hampshire; he could finish fifth in New Hampshire,"" said Brody. ""So he's got all sorts of problems.""
""Here's his main problem: he says he's the electable candidate; he's the guy that can win,"" Brody continued. ""Well you got to start winning states.""
""You have to win Iowa; you have to win New Hampshire, or at least do well,"" he added. ""He's not going to do well in either one of those states.""
Criss-crossing New Hampshire, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is also fighting falling poll numbers.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar are the biggest surprises of the 2020 contest so far.
""There is a hole in Senator Sanders' plan, financially, that's bigger than the entire size of the United States economy,"" said Buttigieg. ""I think it's an example of the kind of politics that frustrates people: big promises and not a lot behind it.""
""As you've probably heard, we're on a bit of a surge,"" Klobuchar told supporters. A new WBZ/Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll shows her in third place in New Hampshire with 14 percent, surpassing Biden and Warren. 
Meanwhile, Trump held a rally in New Hampshire to ""shake up the Dems a little."" His crowd of supporters waited in line for hours in spite of freezing, wet weather.
""Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism and blatant corruption,"" he said at the rally.

The budget, titled ""A Budget for America's Future"", calls for $4.8 trillion in spending, but it also aims to cut $4.4 trillion in spending over a decade and balance the budget in 15 years.
It increases military spending while cutting various domestic programs, like food stamps, farm subsidies, Medicaid and more.
Trump's fiscal 2021 plan promises the government's deficit will crest above $1 trillion only for the current budget year before steadily decreasing to more manageable levels, but only by relying on optimistic economic projections, dramatically scaled-back military operations overseas, and proposed cuts to agency budgets that run directly opposite to two previous budget deals signed by Trump.
The budget ""sets the course for a future of continued American dominance and prosperity,"" Trump said in a message accompanying the document.
""There is optimism that was not here before 63 million Americans asked me to work for them and drain the swamp,"" Trump said. ""For decades, Washington elites told us that Americans had no choice but to accept stagnation, decay, and decline. We proved them wrong. Our economy is strong once more.""
Those cuts have been rejected in the past when Republicans controlled the House of Representatives and won't pass now with Democrats in charge. As expected, harsh backlash has come from Democrat congressional leaders and presidential candidates over Trump's proposed 2021 budget.
While Trump's plan offers the promise of a balanced budget within 15 years, the reality is that no one — Trump, the Democratic-controlled House or the GOP-held Senate — has shown serious interest in tackling a chronic budget gap that forces the government to borrow 22 cents of every dollar it spends.
While there's universal agreement the budget won't pass Congress, Republican spending hawks like Sen. James Lankford and Rep. Jim Jordan say it's a good starting point.
The White House plan to cut $4.4 trillion in spending over the coming decade includes 5 percent cuts in all non-defense agency budgets passed by Congress, including taking $700 billion from Medicaid and $465 billion from Medicare providers. It also calls for a 26 percent cut from the EPA budget.
Economist Stephen Moore - a former Trump campaign adviser - recently told CBN News, both parties need to take spending more seriously.
Moore said, ""Republicans want to spend tens of billions more on the military. Then you've got the Democrats on the other side of the aisle, if you listen to what they're saying in the debates, I mean they're talking about trillions of dollars of more spending. So it's not an era in Washington where we have a lot of fiscal conservatism.""
The government is currently running deficits over a trillion dollars a year, and the total national debt now stands at $23 trillion.

Polls show the top two candidates from the Iowa caucus are also leading there: Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. But the WBZ/Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll now shows Sanders breaking away with 27 percent and Buttigieg with 19 percent.
Sanders, who dominated the state in the 2016 Democratic primary, thinks he can do it again. ""If we win here in New Hampshire, and with your help I think we can win, it'll make it easier for us to win in Nevada, and South Carolina, and in California.""
 
Both men are working to fight off their opponents who are ramping up the attacks after the two emerged as front-runners in the botched Iowa caucuses.
One of those opponents appears to be making headway, according to that poll.
Reports indicate Sen. Amy Klobuchar may be picking up steam in the Granite State, with large crowds coming out to her events the last few days, according to Buzzfeed News.
""Every step of the way, we have defied expectations. We have met every merit,"" she told supporters.
Now the Suffolk University poll shows her in third place with 14 percent, surpassing former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Klobuchar may be gaining traction after what many considered a strong debate performance Friday night.
Biden and Warren each weighed in with 12 percent support.
Biden is pressing his case, arguing he's the best choice to beat Trump. ""I think I'm more ready to be able to defeat Donald Trump and equally importantly, elect a Democratic Senate.""
Meanwhile, Buttigieg is pushing back against claims he's trying to brand himself as the next Obama, even though he clearly campaigned in Iowa by praising voters there for picking a new guy with a ""funny name"".
""Twelve years ago Iowa changed America's understanding of what it looked like to have a viable presidential candidate who was viewed as improbable from the outset,"" Buttigieg told Iowa voters.

""This is what the end result is,"" Trump said while holding up Thursday's copy of the Washington Post with a headline that reads ""Trump Acquitted.""
The gesture was met with roaring applause by members of his family, White House staff, and members of Congress all packed into the East Room of the White House.
The president says it hasn't been easy. He even apologized to his family for having to endure what he calls a rotten ordeal.
However, now Democrats are planning their next moves.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler says lawmakers will likely subpoena John Bolton to learn what he was prepared to tell the Senate, and other high ranking Democrats say the Ukraine story isn't over.
 
It's a risky strategy for Democrats though. Continuing to go after the president just months before the election they run the risk of looking like sore losers. They may also possibly put at peril vulnerable Democrats up for re-election.
Meanwhile, some Republicans are going on offense.
Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson are looking into possible conflicts of interest by Hunter Biden and his Ukraine dealings.
The Treasury Department has complied with their request for information about his government sponsored travel and protective detail he received while his dad was vice president.
While the headlines focused on the president's impeachment statements Thursday, he also used the stage at the National Prayer Breakfast to tout his work to protect religious liberty.
""In America, we don't punish prayer.  We don't tear down crosses.  We don't ban symbols of faith.  We don't muzzle preachers. We don't muzzle pastors,"" he said repeating a line from his State of the Union address Tuesday.
It was a ""proof of performance"" speech that demonstrates why he enjoys high approval among evangelicals.
""To protect faith communities I have taken historic action to defend religious liberty, including the constitutional right to pray in public schools,"" he said to applause.
From criminal justice reform to executive action on the Johnson Amendment – a rule that blocks pastors from talking about politics – the president listed the promises he's made good on.
""I also recently took executive action to stop taxpayer dollars from going to colleges and universities that spread the poison of anti-Semitism and bad things about Christianity,"" he said.
And he reminded the crowd of Christian and other religious leaders no president has done more to protect the unborn.
""And we're pursuing medical breakthroughs to save pre-mature babies because every child is a sacred gift from God,"" the president said to applause.

McCain specifically asked Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, about a recent radio interview during which he asserted that life begins “with breath,” arguing an unborn child is not actually human until he or she breathes air outside the womb for the first time.
FAITHWIRE  ‘The Answer Is…Unknowable’: Pete Buttigieg Is Lying to Himself or to You About Abortion
“There’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath,” Buttigieg said at the time. “And so even that is something that we can interpret differently.”
“In my circles,” McCain explained, “it was passed around because I think the interpretation from pro-life people like me was that you meant a baby actually being born and there’s a lot of controversy with … what it means and what time a woman should be able to have an abortion. I wanted you to clarify because I found that statement to be pretty radical.”
Buttigieg really sidestepped McCain’s question by instead telling her that people “interpret their own moral lights, and for that matter, interpret Scripture differently.”
FAITHWIRE  LGBTQ Activists Angry to Learn Pete Buttigieg Rang the Salvation Army Bell
Unsatisfied with his avoidant answer, the ABC co-host asked Buttigieg if he supports partial-birth abortion, to which he said it is not “up to a government official to draw the line.”
McCain then asked the 2020 candidate if he would be OK with a woman who just delivered her baby saying she wanted to “invoke infanticide” — something Buttigieg asserted doesn’t happen (though, it should be noted, that’s exactly what Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, endorsed last year).
Buttigieg then created a scenario that pro-lifers say is fairly unlikely:
Think about the situation. If this is a late-term situation, then by definition, it’s one where a woman was expecting to carry the pregnancy to term. Then she gets the most, perhaps, devastating news of her life. We’re talking about families that may have picked out a name, maybe assembling a crib, and they learn something excruciating, and are faced with this terrible choice. And I don’t know what to tell them, morally, about what they should do. I just know that I trust — and her decision, medically or morally, isn’t going to be any better because the government is commanding her to do it.
Frustrated by the dialogue, McCain assured Buttigieg, an Episcopal Christian, that she believes his position on abortion is ""radical"".
“Quite frankly,” she added, “that answer was just as radical as I thought it was. Sorry.”"

The president held a ""celebration"" Thursday afternoon at the White House, speaking out against the impeachment investigations against him and in a remarkable moment apologized to his family. 
""I want to apologize to my family for having them having to go through a very rotten deal by some evil and sick people and that includes Baron, Ivanka. Honey – come,"" as Trump motioned to First lady Melania Trump to come up to the podium for a hug.

Senate Votes to Acquit President Trump on Both Impeachment Charges
What Trump Said About Religious Liberty, Late-Term Abortion, and Socialism in His Third State of the Union
The Top 5 Most Beautifully Stunning Moments at the State of the Union
Just a few hours after appearing at the National Prayer Breakfast, and less than 24 hours after his acquittal, the President addressed the nation from the East Room of the White House. 
Trump and his supporters say his acquittal is a full vindication and exoneration. The president called the event, not a speech or news conference, but a ""celebration""
""I've done some things wrong, I will admit, but this is what the end result is,"" Trump told the assembled audience, holding up a newspaper with the headline ""Trump Acquitted"" printed in bold ink across the top.
""We can take that home honey. I'm going to frame it. It's the only good headline I've ever had in The Washington Post,"" the president said.  
He then gave a shout out to his legal team and Republican lawmakers calling them a ""great group of warriors."" 
""Mitch McConnell you did a fantastic job,"" he said. 
But one vote which denied Trump a unanimous ""not guilty"" verdict was when Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) voted to convict him on the first article of impeachment. 
""My promise before God to apply impartial justice required, I put biases aside for the sake of a partisan end expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience,"" Romney said before the Senate vote Wednesday. 
It was a historic vote that did not go unnoticed by President Trump. 
""One failed presidential candidate and I call that half a vote cause he actually voted for us on the other one, but we had one failed presidential candidate that's the only vote we lost,"" Trump said. 
And the president doubled down on his earlier swipes at the National Prayer Breakfast.
""I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away and I said some things that a lot of people wouldn't have said. But I meant every word of it, "" he added.  
Trump called the House Speaker ""a horrible person.""
""She may pray, but she prays for the opposite – but I doubt she prays at all,"" he said. 
Rep. Pelosi (D-CA) earlier said the president is forever impeached, justifying her decision to tearing up his State of the Union speech in front of a national television audience as a dignified act. 
""I tore up the misrepresentation of the truth,"" she said.  
Trump said that he'll probably have to deal with impeachment in the future and if that happens he said, ""We'll beat them again if we have to."" "

It means President Trump will remain in office.
Trump, 73, was acquitted by the GOP-held Senate of the charges of abuse of power by a vote of 52-48 and of obstruction of Congress 53-47. The charges were brought to the Senate by the Democrat-held House of Representatives less than three months ago. 
Senators sworn to do ""impartial justice"" were required to stand at their desks for the roll call and state their votes – ""guilty"" or ""not guilty.""
Earlier in the day, one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, announced on the Senate floor that he was breaking with his party and voting for impeachment. He was the only Republican to vote ""guilty"" on the charge of abuse of power. 
Ahead of voting, some of the most closely watched senators took to the Senate floor to tell their constituents, and the nation, what they had decided. The Senate chaplain has been opening the trial proceedings with daily prayers for the senators.
""This decision is not about whether you like or dislike this president,"" began GOP Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine centrist, announcing her resolve to acquit Trump on both charges.
GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said that while he doesn't condone Trump's actions, he was not prepared to remove him from the ballot nine months before the election. ""Let the people decide,"" he said.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell slammed House Democrats' drive to impeach Trump as ""the most rushed, least fair, and least thorough"" in history. 
He said the two impeachment charges against Trump – that he abused his power and obstructed Congress' ensuing investigation – are ""constitutionally incoherent"" and don't ""even approach a case for the first presidential removal in American history.″
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York accused McConnell and his GOP colleagues of sweeping Trump's misconduct under the rug. 
""The administration, its top people, and Senate Republicans are all hiding the truth,"" Schumer said, claiming that Trump tried to ""blackmail a foreign country to interfere in our elections."" House Democrats prosecuting the case argued that Trump abused his power when he pressured Ukraine to investigate whether Democratic rival Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to drop a corruption investigation that could have involved his son Hunter.
Although the trial is over, investigations will continue with talk already of the House Democrats planning to subpoena former National Security Adviser John Bolton.
Republicans Say Impeachment Effort Will Hurt Democrats in the Election
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warns this impeachment process sets a dangerous precedent for future presidents.
""It's never enough when it comes to President Trump – this sham process is the low point. If you think you've done the country a service by legitimizing this impeachment process, what you've done is unleashed the forces of hell – this is sour grapes,"" Graham said.
Donald Trump, Jr, tells CBN News he thinks voters see through impeachment. ""This impeachment started the day he beat Hillary Clinton and has gone on since then. It has manifested itself a few times, first it was Russia, then it was this, yada, yada, yada. It's just gone on forever.""
Majority Leader McConnell is predicting this will play well for vulnerable GOP senators up for election in 2020.
""Every one of our people in tough races, every one of them is in better shape today than they were before the impeachment trial started,"" McConnell said.
The impeachment finale comes as President Trump has just hit his highest job approval rating in the Gallup Poll.
The latest survey has him at 49 percent approval which is the best mark for the president since he took office in January in 2017.
The poll also showed that 50 percent disapprove.
Among Republicans, the president has a 94 percent approval rating compared to just seven percent among Democrats.
 
And 63 percent approve of the way the president is handling the economy. The public is showing its highest satisfaction with the economy in nearly 15 years."

The Washington Times reports Senate Bill 399 introduced by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, would've joined Virginia into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact and awarded its electoral votes to the presidential ticket that receives the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
Ebbin withdrew the bill from consideration Tuesday without identifying the reason.

VA Bill Is Latest Effort by Democrats to Change Electoral College, Taking Away Voice of Rural Americans
Another measure in the Virginia House of Delegates, House Bill 177, introduced by Del. Mark Levine, D-Alexandria was defeated last Friday in committee by a 10-12 vote. Three Democrats joined Republicans to vote no.
Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, told WRIC-TV his reason for opposing the bill. ""One of the things that was in place was to try to ensure that certain large states like California and New York, now, don't have all the control in making a decision for president."" 
Levine has tried to pass similar legislation the past three consecutive sessions, The Times reported. 
""The Electoral College is an outdated institution that creates an undemocratic system for deciding who holds the most important office in the land,"" Del. Ibraheem Samirah, D-Fairfax, a co-patron of HB 177 told the newspaper. 
But supporters of the Electoral College say America's Founding Fathers had a really good reason for creating it.
How the Electoral College Works
Under the Electoral College established by the US Constitution, there are a total of 538 electors. Each state has the same number of electors as it does Members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two Senators. 
A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.
There's been an effort nationwide, led mainly by members of the Democrat Party, to bypass or abolish the original intent of the Electoral College. The effort has escalated since the 2016 election in which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote while Donald Trump won in enough states to win the Electoral College and the presidency.
The current system requires a presidential candidate to win the states, not just individual voters. That ensures less-populated states still have a voice.
So far, 15 states and the District of Columbia have passed NPVIC legislation.
Colorado was one of those states that passed the measure. Jerry Sonnenberg, a Colorado Republican state senator, told The Times he opposed the bill because he believed the change would weaken the electoral power of sparsely populated rural states like Wyoming and Utah while strengthening states like California and New York.
In his view, the Electoral College was created so that ""people in rural areas did not get overrun by the masses.""
In 2019, a Gallup poll found more Americans prefer naming winners of national elections based on a popular vote. ""They favor an amendment to the Constitution to make that happen, but are more reluctant to have states make changes to how they award their electoral votes,"" Gallup said in a summary of its finding.
A constitutional amendment, however, is required to switch from the Electoral College to a popular vote with two-thirds of the states being needed to vote to approve such a change. "

Gretchen Whitmer used the Democratic Party's response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address to quickly swivel her party's main focus from impeachment to working-class voters' worries, saying her party is set on easing health care costs and other pocketbook concerns.
In her 11-minute address, Whitmer only mentioned Trump's impeachment trial near the end of her speech Tuesday night. 
She also threw in a few references to his tweets saying, ""Bullying people on Twitter doesn't fix bridges — it burns them.""
Most of her address, however, was spent on her party's efforts on health care and some people's struggles to pay their bills. These are the issues that Democrats focused on in the 2018 election and helped win her party control of the House.
Democrats won House control in 2018 by lambasting efforts by Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law. Democrats say they will concentrate on health care in this year's campaign as well, including opposing an administration-backed federal lawsuit aimed at declaring Obama's statute unconstitutional.
""It's pretty simple. Democrats are trying to make your health care better. Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away,"" Whitmer surmised. 
Whitmer tried to show how Democrats across the country are taking action to help increase school funding and minimum wage hikes.
She also summed up some of the more controversial topics her party has been promoting to voters for the last several years in just a few sentences -- alluding to gun control, unions, college payment, environmental controls, the LGBT agenda, abortion, and more.
""Democrats want safe schools. We want everyone to have a path to a good life, whether it's through a union apprenticeship, a community college, a four-year university -- without drowning in debt. We want your water to be clean. We want you to love who you love, and to live authentically, as your true selves. We want women to have autonomy over their own bodies. We want our country welcoming and everyone's vote counted,"" the Michigan governor said.
In Democrats' Spanish-language response, freshman Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar focused on health care and workers' struggles to get by."

The Faith and Freedom Coalition, led by prominent evangelical leader Ralph Reed will make the official announcement later today. The conservative organization plans to spend roughly $50 million during the 2020 election cycle. Specifically, FFC will target certain battleground states. Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania are all key swing states but Reed's group is going beyond those traditional bellwethers and plans to hit evangelicals with the digital campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona.
The initial digital onslaught will come in the form of emails, text messages and other social media outlets and plans to target nearly four million faith voters in the next five days alone. 
 
The digital campaign will focus on events and actions taken by Trump carrying through on campaign promises to evangelicals including his remarks at the recent, March for Life Rally in DC, where he became the first president to ever address the crowd in person. It also includes decisions such as moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, protecting religious freedom, withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal, defeating ISIS and the strong economy.
 
Statistics show President Trump won the White House because of strong support among conservative evangelicals. Exit polls in 2016 showed a record 81 percent of white evangelicals backed his candidacy. Polls still consistently show strong support.   "

The Top 5 Most Beautifully Stunning Moments at the State of the Union
But despite delivering the State of the Union address under the cloud of impeachment – Trump did not mention it. 
The president's theme was ""The Great American Comeback"" touting his economic success since taking office. 
  
""The state of our union is stronger than ever before,"" Trump said.
 
Also he spoke about defending religious liberty in powerful terms stating:
 
""We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of faith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!""
 
Next, he called on Congress to fight for the unborn.
 
""I am calling on members of Congress to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.""
 
Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) applauded Trump's pro-life challenge saying, ""The fundamental protection of life in the United States to end, at long last, late-term abortions and certainly we can all agree on that."" 
 
And Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA) said, ""It was shocking to me that Democrats would not even stand to defend late-term abortions it is difficult for me to wrap my mind around that."" 
 
The absence of some Democrats did not go unnoticed, yet Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) said it was important for him to attend the event, even if he disagrees with President Trump.
""I disagree with the president on many things but he's still the President of the United States and I believe it is my constitutional obligation to listen to the president and try to make the best I can to find any common ground there may be."" 
 
Lawmakers found common ground with a standing ovation for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guiado - a surprise guest of the president.
 
""Mr. President please take this message back, that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous fight for freedom. Socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom restores the soul,"" Trump said.
 
Everyone in the chamber rose to their feet again to welcome back Sgt. Townsend Williams in a realtime surprise homecoming.
Then conservatives in the room applauded as radio host Rush Limbaugh was honored on the spot with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That last-minute move came a day after Limbaugh revealed he's facing a battle with Stage 4 lung cancer.
 
""In recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all the incredible work that you have done for charity,"" Trump announced.
 
The address wrapped up with the House speaker making it clear what she thought of the president's speech, visibly tearing up the pages on camera.
Hice added, ""Unbelievable I mean while the President is saying God Bless America, Nancy Pelosi is behind him tearing the speech up. That to me exemplifies the Democratic Party we are dealing with in Washington DC.""
White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway weighed in too, accusing Pelosi of throwing a ""temper tantrum"". Conway said, ""America saw an incorrigible child ripping up the State of the Union... I think it shows you how petty and peevish and partisan the Democratic party has become.""
Meanwhile, there was at least one bright light from the Democratic side of the aisle during the president's address. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) is being praised by conservatives for breaking away from her party to stand and applaud the president when he talked about ""opportunity zones"" which give tax breaks for investments to help low-income areas.

President Trump planned a number of powerful moments to punctuate his message throughout the State of the Union address Tuesday night, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's feud with the president couldn't fully sour the evening. 
Pelosi, who led the impeachment effort against Trump, refused to introduce the president as ""a high honor and distinct privilege"" as is the custom for the Speaker of the House. And Trump appeared to decline to shake her hand when she offered it, although there's widespread debate on social media about whether he actually saw her gesture. But one stunning move was unmistakable. To cap off the evening, Pelosi tore up the pages of his speech right behind him, repeatedly shredding the pages right after he finished.

What Trump Said About Religious Liberty, Late-Term Abortion, and Socialism in His Third State of the Union
'God's Grace Is Still Shining': Extended Coverage of Trump's State of the Union
While that display of animosity was certainly stunning for its negativity, there were more than five moments that were equally uplifting, offered by the president. Here they are: 
1. Confronting Socialism
Standing in direct defiance of the socialist debacle in Venezuela, President Trump surprised most observers by introducing ""the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó"" who was sitting in the House gallery. Guaidó is the opposition leader who has been selected by Venezuelan lawmakers to become president of the country, but dictator Nicolás Maduro still clings to power through violent force.  
""Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom!"" Trump said.  ""Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.""
2. Taking a Pro-Life Stand
In a powerful pro-life moment, the president introduced a little girl who had survived even though her mom gave birth only 21 weeks into her pregnancy – a stage at which some babies are still aborted because pro-choice advocates say they're not viable. Trump said little 2-year-old Ellie Schneider, born as a micro-preemie, is proof that all life should be cherished and late-term abortion should be ended.
""Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life,"" Trump said. ""Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!""
3. Reuniting a Military Family
Trump honored military families in several ways throughout the night. He applauded Brigadier General Charles McGee, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen – the first black fighter pilots who fought against Nazi Germany in World War II.
He also honored the courage of a wife and son of a service member who was killed by a roadside bomb, explaining that it was for families like theirs that he took action to eliminate Iran's architect of terror in Iraq. 
Get FREE email alerts from CBN News in your Inbox!
But the happiest moment came when he later introduced another military wife and her two young children, and in a sudden twist, he announced that their husband and daddy Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams had just returned from the front in Afghanistan, reuniting the family right then and there inside the Capitol.
4. Honoring an American Victim of ISIS
The president also introduced Carl and Marsha Mueller whose daughter Kayla, 26, was captured, tortured, and killed by ISIS terrorist leader Al-Baghdadi himself. Trump announced that the mission to end Al-Baghdadi's life was given a code name - ""Task Force 8-14."" It was a reference to a special day:  August 14th – Kayla's birthday. Carl Mueller held up a large photo of Kayla for the world to remember her as the entire room stood to applaud.
""America's warriors never forgot Kayla, and neither will we,"" Trump said.
5. A Last-Minute Medal of Freedom
Finally, in another touching moment, Trump introduced a last-minute guest, conservative lion Rush Limbaugh who just announced this week that he has stage 4 lung cancer. Not only did Trump honor him by inviting him to the State of the Union, but he also bestowed an impromptu Presidential Medal of Freedom on Limbaugh, and First Lady Melania Trump presented it to him right on the spot. Democrats did not stand to applaud, despite Limbaugh's dire diagnosis.

There were certainly other powerful moments from the evening, like when the president honored a little girl he had invited, announcing a scholarship for her to attend whatever school she wanted so she wouldn't be trapped in a failing government school. 
Trump maintained a tone of optimism throughout much of his address, concluding, ""Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!""

Both are far ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren who finished third with 18 percent.
And former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth with just under 16 percent. On the campaign trail in New Hampshire, Biden acknowledged he did not do well.
""I am not going to sugarcoat it - we took a gut punch in Iowa,"" Biden admitted.

Jody Jones from Farmersville, California: On December 17, 2018, Jody's brother, Rocky Jones, was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant in Tulare County, California. The criminal alien who committed this brutal murder had previously been arrested for violent crimes and had been deported twice. The criminal alien was arrested in December 2018 for the sixth time, but because of California's sanctuary state policy, he was released from jail. A few days later, the criminal alien went on a 24-hour ""reign of terror,"" injuring several people, robbing a gas station, leading law enforcement on a high-speed chase, and killing 51-year old Rocky, who was known as a kind and gentle soul. Rocky leaves behind a precious daughter and 4 brothers who are still grieving the loss of their loved one.
Ellie and Robin Schneider from Kansas City, Missouri: Ellie was born at just 21 weeks and six days. She is one of the youngest babies to survive in the United States. With the help of an incredible medical team – and the prayers of her parents and their community – Ellie kept beating the odds, exceeding milestones, and fighting for life. Today, Ellie is a happy, healthy two-year-old girl who brings endless joy to her mother, Robin, and her entire family.
Janiyah and Stephanie Davis from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Janiyah is a fourth-grade student from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Kelli and Gage Hake from Stillwater, Oklahoma: Kelli Hake was at home with her one-year-old son, Gage, when she received the terrible news that her husband, Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, had been killed serving on his second tour of duty in Iraq. While on patrol, Sergeant Hake's Bradley fighting vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb supplied by the Iranian terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani. Kelli and Gage directly suffered from Soleimani's campaign to kill and maim U.S. service members. Last month, President Donald J. Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani as he was once again trying to initiate attacks on American service members.
Paul Morrow from Montgomery, Alabama: Paul is a United States Army veteran. After leaving the military, Morrow started a successful contracting business and today is building a new concrete plant in an Opportunity Zone in Montgomery, Alabama.

Speaking to a joint session of Congress and the American people Tuesday night, Trump touted his optimistic message for the US as ""The Great American Comeback,"" highlighting his list of accomplishments that will launch his 2020 campaign.
Standing at the speaker's rostrum with Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sitting directly behind him, the president said, ""Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again!  America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright.""

BELOW: Watch the full CBN News Faith Nation Coverage of the State of the Union
""The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.""
""I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world -- and it is not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me:  The State of our Union is stronger than ever before!"" the President declared. 
Trump touched on his success of building the economy over the previous administration with the addition of 3.5 million jobs. He also spoke about his success in negotiating two successful trade agreements with the lowest unemployment rate in US history. 
""Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA – only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promise. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law,"" he noted. 
""I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA,"" Trump added. 
Touching on Venezuela, the President said the US is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro.  
Trump then recognized ""the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó"" who was sitting in the House gallery.  
""Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom!"" he said.  ""Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.""
Trump also talked about the investment of $2.2 trillion in the US military with contributions of more than $400 billion from NATO allies.
In a touching moment, the President introduced 13-year-old Iain Lanphier who dreams of attending to the Air Force Academy with his eye on the Space Force.  Then Trump introduced Lanphier's great-grandfather Brigadier General Charles McGee, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, the first black fighter pilots who fought against Nazi Germany in World War II. 
Trump also spoke about the necessity that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. He recognized Melania Trump's ""Be Best"" initiative ""to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children.""
Speaking on the subject of health care, the President said, ""We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions -- that is a guarantee. And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security,"" which was met by a standing ovation.
Trump slammed home his point about health care and socialism.
""One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care!"" he said.
The President also spoke against free health care for illegal aliens.
""If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens,"" he said. 
Speaking to the problem of securing the nation's southern border, Trump said, ""This will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and the very powerful wall is being built.  We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year.""
On the problem of drug prices, the President called for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. ""Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay,"" Trump promised. 
The President took a moment to thank conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh for his ""tireless devotion to our country.""
Catching Limbaugh off-guard while he was sitting next to Mrs. Trump in the gallery, the President told him he was being presented with the country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As lawmakers looked on, Mrs. Trump put the medal around Limbaugh's neck.
Recognizing Ellie Schneider, who was a micro-preemie born in Kansas City, Mo. in 2017, the president said, ""Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life.""
""Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America's youngest patients. That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies,"" Trump said. 
""Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!"" he said.
Trump also spoke about the danger of allowing cities even states to offer sanctuary to illegal criminal aliens. 
""I ask the Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately.  The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans -- not criminal aliens!"" he said. 
Trump also spoke about the necessity of securing the nation's southern border. 
""Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May -- dropping 8 straight months in a row.  And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down,"" he said. 
On the subject of religious freedom, the president said his administration is also defending religious liberty, including the constitutional right to pray in public schools. 
""In America, we do not punish prayer.  We do not tear down crosses.  We do not ban symbols of faith.  We do not muzzle preachers and pastors.  In America, we celebrate faith.  We cherish religion.  We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!"" he said.
Looking to the future, the Commander-in-Chief called for infrastructure improvements and challenged America to embrace space as the next frontier. 
""I am asking the Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts -- using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars,"" Trump said.
The president also introduced Carl and Marsha Mueller whose daughter Kayla, 26, was killed by ISIS terrorist leader Al-Baghdadi himself. He told them the mission to end  Al-Baghdadi's life was given a name - ""Task Force 8-14.""  It was a reference to a special day:  August 14th - Kayla's birthday.
Touching on the subject of Iran, the President said the next move is up to them. 
""In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers.  The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people,"" he said, touting the effectiveness of US sanctions against the Iranian regime.
In probably what was the most touching moment during the president's address, one military family was reunited. Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams is serving in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East. He was reunited with his wife Amy, and their 2 children -- 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan.
In closing, President Trump spoke about the history of America and great men and women who had succeeded in helping build the country. 
""As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur.  This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more.  This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley.  This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo,"" he said.
But he also reminded all Americans, ""The best is yet to come!""
""This Nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American Age, the American Epic, the American Adventure, has only just begun!""
""Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!"" he concluded. 
The formal basis for the State of the Union Address is from the US Constitution which states:
The President ""shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."" Article II, Section 3, Clause 1.
There have been a total of 96 in-person State of the Union messages, according to the United States House of Representatives website."

The theme of tonight's State of the Union is ""The Great American Comeback."" President Trump is expected to tout the strong economy, jobs and trade deals. 
According to a senior administration official, the president will keep it positive, laying out a clear vision of ""relentless optimism."" 
Trump made it clear that despite what's happening on Capitol Hill with impeachment, he will not postpone the speech.
""I am going to have it, it's going to be done, we are going to talk about the achievements that we made. Nobody has made achievements like we've made, so many different things, I am so proud of what we've done for our vets with choice,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News over the weekend.
Still, the impeachment drama hangs over Trump, who is only the second president to give a State of the Union address while in the middle of an impeachment trial, and the nation remains deeply divided.
It's unclear if Trump plans to bring up impeachment as he stands before some of the very lawmakers who want to remove him from office. Republicans have urged him to avoid the subject.
""My advice would be that in the State of the Union he should move on,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN). 
""The president's got a good record when you look at the economy and lower taxes and fewer regulations and higher incomes and I think he'd be well advised to focus on that and let the impeachment trial speak for itself,"" he continued.
""He is his own person, obviously he can bring up things as he chooses to... but I'm not coming into that speech to be able to hear more about impeachment,"" said Sen. James Lankford (R-OK). 
The Senate is on track to wrap up the trial on Wednesday, an acquittal all but sealed. 
No GOP senators have indicated they would vote for Trump's removal from office, including moderate Republicans like Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski who criticized the president's behavior but said she will vote to acquit him.
""I cannot vote to convict. The Constitution provides for impeachment, but does not demand it in all instances,"" Murkowski said.
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin from West Virginia is still undecided on how he will vote, but on Tuesday he urged his colleagues to formally censure the president.
""Censure would allow this body to unite across party lines and as an equal branch of government to formally denounce the president's actions and hold him accountable. His behavior cannot go unchecked by the Senate,"" Manchin said.
 
Even so, he's one of a few Democrats who may join Republicans in voting to acquit the president.
The Senate's final vote on acquittal or conviction is set for Wednesday afternoon.

No One Knows Yet,"Caucus chaos struck in Iowa as inconsistent and inaccurate counts have delayed the results. Who's the culprit? Democratic Party leaders blame it on technology and are now counting votes by hand. Still up in the air: Who won?
As the count went deeper into the night with no results, the campaigns began to pack it up and move on. ""So listen. It is too close to call,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren told supporters.

Iowa's Democratic Party leaders say it wasn't a hack or an intrusion, but they're concerned about ""quality checks"" and ""inconsistencies,"" some blaming a new app designed to help the reporting.
Joe Biden announced, ""I want to make sure they're very careful in their deliberations. And indications are, our indications are it's going to be close.""

The disaster is further muddying up a hotly contested primary season.
Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg had all been hoping to break out the pack with a win in the Hawkeye state.
With uncertainty in the air as candidates addressed their supporters Monday night each took advantage of the situation to celebrate like they were the winner.
Pete Buttigieg claimed, ""By all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.""

Sanders supporters are hopeful this is finally his year. Jok Dut Jok of Des Moines told CBN News, ""I feel like Bernie is really going to be the answer that we need, I feel like he's the only one viable that can go against Trump right now.""
While Warren caucus-goers also had some pep in their step. ""I'm so excited! I'm so thrilled,"" Katherine Eckhouse said.
Biden didn't quite make it as a viable candidate at every precinct, but his supporters aren't giving up.
McKenna Tingle said, ""I think that overall Biden does have the support we need, some of the candidates still have confidence that he's going to do well, so I think a lot of Iowans just aren't showing up for him but I think ultimately he will do well.""
 
Still, many Democrat voters tells CBN News it's time for some new leaders.
Robert Meryl of Johnston, Iowa said, ""I feel like it's time to get some younger people with some different ideas.""
 
The majority stands ready to support whoever wins the nomination.
Elizabeth Warren supporter Veronica Tessler said, ""I will be behind whoever the candidate will be.""
But no matter whom that is, Donald Trump, Jr. tells CBN News none of the candidates are a match for his dad.
""The reality when I look at what I believe to be the two frontrunners right now, whether it's Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, well one's a communist, that's great, I can work with that – and the other, honestly, can't remember what state he's in 50% of the time,"" Donald Trump, Jr. said.
 
Since 2000, each Democratic presidential candidate who's won the Iowa caucus has gone on to win the party's nomination. Given the unusually crowded primary field, many campaigns hope 2020 marks the end of that streak.

One senior administration official says ""in his address, the president will lay out a vision of relentless optimism.""
Trump made it clear that despite what's going in the Senate, he will not postpone the speech.
""I am going to have it. It's going to be done.  We are going to talk about the achievements that we made,"" Trump said. ""Nobody has made achievements like we've made, so many different things. I am so proud of what we've done for our vets with choice."" 
It's not clear if the President plans to mention the impeachment trial or call out Democrats sitting in the audience.
This will be his first face-to-face meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) since House Democrats voted late last year to impeach him. 
Last week, the Senate voted 51-49 to reject additional witness testimony in the trial, clearing the way for lawmakers and Trump's defense team to begin their closing arguments.
""The President and his aides wielded the powers of the presidency and the full weight of the US government to increase pressure on Ukraine's government and coerce him to announce two sham investigations that would smear his potential election opponent and raise his political standing,"" said Rep. Val Demings (D-FL)
""At the end of the day, the key conclusion, we believe the only conclusion based on the evidence, based on the articles of impeachment themselves, based on the Constitution is you must vote to acquit the president,"" argued Patrick Philbin, deputy counsel to the president. ""At the end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one election and try to interfere in the coming election which begins today in Iowa."" 
At this point, it looks like the vote will be held at 4:00 pm Wednesday to acquit or convict President Trump. 
Meanwhile, CBN News will provide full coverage of the State of the Union address on the CBN News Channel beginning at 8:30 Tuesday night."

But the president's acquittal is virtually guaranteed since it would take at least 20 Republican senators to go along with the Democrats to remove him from office.
The president told Fox News he believes House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is in a bad spot. ""I think she's a very confused, very nervous woman. I don't think she wanted to do this. I think she really knew what was going to happen and it's her worst nightmare.""
Trump tweeted on Sunday that the Democrats ""are playing with the people by taking it this far!""

0,2020-02-03T07:15:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/february/where-iowa-voters-stand-ahead-of-tonights-highly-anticipated-caucus,Where Iowa Voters Stand Ahead of Tonight's Highly-Anticipated Caucus,"DES MOINES, Iowa - Democratic presidential candidates have been blitzing the state of Iowa in a frenzied finish before voters cast their ballots in tonight's first-in-the-nation caucus. Four candidates are locked in a tight race.
The Democratic hopefuls have been hosting multiple events and covering hundreds of miles desperate to win over those last-minute votes. Thousands of Iowans and political tourists crammed into large venues to hear directly from candidates one last time ahead of Monday's vote.
 
After being stuck in impeachment hearings in Washington all week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) made up for lost time on the campaign trail by recruiting her dog Bailey, known as her ""furrogate"", to stand in her place in her famous post-rally selfie line.
 
""It's going to take some big structural change are you ready for that?"" Warren asked an enthusiastic crowd.
 
Nearby, former Vice President Joe Biden addressed a packed gymnasium touting a message of unity. ""I refuse to accept the notion that we're going to be in total chaos and war with the other side because we're done if that's true,"" commented Biden.
 
But he also went on the attack against President Trump.
 
""In a room with our flag officers and generals, he looked them in the eye and referred to them as losers, dopes, and babies – who in God's name does he think he is talking to our people like that?"" questioned Biden. ""To state the obvious, this commander in chief not only doesn't understand it but if he does he's the most calloused son of a gun we've ever had as president.""
 
A day before the caucus, many voters like Daryl Hagans of Des Moines told CBN News they're still undecided.
 
""I'd probably say my top three would be Pete (Buttigieg), Biden and Warren,"" explained Hagans.
 
Monday night could end with the top four, Biden, Warren, Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, seeing only slight differences in their number of delegates.
 
""In our polling, there's about five points that separates the top from the second and they're all sort of bunched together,"" explained political science professor and pollster David Peterson. ""And one thing we know about the Iowa caucuses is attitudes of Iowans are pretty fluid and they change pretty fast in those last couple days.""
 
While Senator Bernie Sanders appears to be leading in the state he narrowly lost four years ago, Peterson speculates his 2020 surge may have peaked.
 
""The supporters of those other four top candidates are much more likely to settle amongst each other than they are to switch over to Sanders,"" noted Peterson.
 
Moderate Democrats like Robert Fuhs of Indiana, a Pete Buttigieg supporter, says he's not quite ready to feel the Bern. ""I don't think the Midwest will go for this. Bernie's idea of immediate healthcare for everybody when 50 percent of the country is pretty happy with what they have right now, I can't imagine that winning,"" Fuhs told CBN News.
 
And others are hesitant to vote Biden back in office.
 
""If it's Biden or Bernie they're too old, I can't vote them, I'm sorry,"" said Mary Marksmeyier of Des Moines, a Buttigieg supporter. ""I'm 68, I would not try to vote for somebody older than me.""
 
But other Democrats stand ready to unite around whoever the nominee ends up being.
 
""I will be behind whoever the candidate will be,"" declared Veronica Tessler, an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
 
""I think it's important that the Democratic Party stay united,"" echoed Sean Nelson, who stands behind Bernie Sanders.
 
Tonight the country and party leadership will get the first glimpse of whether voters prefer moderate candidates like Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg or want a more progressive choice like Senators Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren."

The vote was 51- 49 with Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) going against the party line to side with Democrats for witnesses.
Trump was impeached by the House in December on charges he abused power and obstructed Congress as he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and then chose not to cooperate with the congressional probe of his actions.

It was a significant win for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and President Trump, bypassing what could have been a floor fight over testimony from former National Security Advisor John Bolton and other witnesses. Bolton's upcoming book reportedly claims the president held back aid to Ukraine to pressure it to investigate his possible political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
President Trump pushed back, saying he did nothing wrong at a rally Thursday night in Michigan.
""Remember the tax cut was the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and what do they do?"" Trump asked the audience. ""They impeach you, explain, explain that one. We have great Republicans out there and they don't like it any better than you do. Very partisan situation. A disgrace to our country.""
Sen. John Barrasso, (R-WY), told Fox News on Thursday that he thought senators had heard enough. ""I think, by that time, people will have heard enough,"" Barrasso said. ""They will have learned what they need to know about this case. And the plan is for Friday to vote. And the momentum is moving to say we've heard enough. Let's move to final judgment.""

Now, a movement to push back against the transgender movement is beginning to take place.
One of its early victories came in South Dakota this week. Lawmakers voted 46 to 23 in the statehouse to pass a bill that would ban doctors from performing sex-reassignment surgeries like mastectomies and from dispensing puberty-blocking drugs to children under the age of 16.

Former LGBTQers Testify: If You No Longer Want to Be Gay or Transgender, You Don't Have to Be
State Rep. Fred Deutsch, the bill's sponsor, told CBN News he hopes the legislation will protect children in ways similar to other laws already in place. ""We don't let them smoke. We don't let them drink. We don't let them vape,"" he said. ""It just makes sense that we don't want them to be recipients of cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers as young children.""
Lawmakers in several other states are considering similar legislation and Deutsch says he's aware of a dozen or so states that will soon introduce such bills.
He cited a Texas case as helping to galvanize the movement.  CBN News and a number of other media outlets have followed the plight of a seven-year-old boy, caught in a custody battle with parents who disagree about his gender.
Deutsch said it served as a ""tipping point"" for many lawmakers, convincing them to move to safeguard children from medical interventions.
Transgender advocates say that Deutsch's bill will undermine health care for children. 
""This legislature is compromising the health care of trans youth in dangerous and potentially dangerous ways,"" said Libby Skarin, policy director for the ACLU in South Dakota.
Some of the most prominent medical voices in South Dakota and across the country also support pediatric transgender medicine.
The Pediatric Endocrine Society issued a statement in October applauding puberty blockers, calling the treatment ""reversible"" and a good way to alleviate the distress of those suffering from gender dysphoria.
But some endocrinologists, like Dr. Michael Laidlaw, note that there's no FDA evidence to support the claim. Others are concerned that there's no long-term studies supporting the effectiveness of the rapidly growing field of pediatric transgender medicine. Sixty-five pediatric gender clinics have opened their doors in recent years.
Protecting Women's Sports
Lawmakers are also considering a new crop of legislation that aims to protect female athletes in high school from trans athletes who can easily outmatch them on the playing field, thanks to biological differences such as bone density, lung capacity, and physical strength.
GOP lawmakers in nine states have sponsored bills that would help to level the playing field with requirements such as mandating that boys who want to compete as girls identify as a girl on their birth certificate.
That would help in states like Connecticut, where two boys who identify as girls now hold 15 state championship track titles.
Two female track athletes have filed a federal discrimination complaint with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, saying that their opportunities for recruitment and college scholarships are being negatively impacted by the state's transgender policy.
In Washington, a group of GOP lawmakers in the House has introduced a bill to protect female athletes. It would deny Title IX funds to women's sports that allow biological male athletes to compete against biological female athletes.

0,2020-01-31T14:45:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2020/january/ive-had-enough-nys-radical-abortion-law-drives-conservative-pro-life-women-to-run-for-congress,'I've Had Enough': NY's 'Aggressive' Abortion Law Drives Pro-Life Women to Run for Congress,"SARATOGA SPRINGS, NY –  It's a David vs. Goliath battle for the soul of New York. Two Christian, conservative women are running for Congress in this heavily ""blue"" state. And although the odds may be stacked against them, Liz Joy of Albany and Beth Parlato of Buffalo say in the wake of recent events, they can no longer be silent. 
In January 2019, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act that expanded the right to an abortion for any reason, even to the point of birth. It also eliminated several restrictions on abortion. Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the nation's most aggressive abortion bill into law as state representatives cheered. Later that night, the governor ordered the One World Trade Center to be lit in pink to celebrate the event and ""shine a bright light forward for the rest of the nation to follow."" 
Last Straw 
It was the straw that broke the camel's back for attorney Beth Parlato of Buffalo and real estate agent and author Liz Joy of Albany.
""I've had enough,"" said Liz Joy, a Republican running in New York's 20th Congressional district. ""When you have people that are supposed to be role models for your children, the governor of New York, clapping and cheering and lighting up buildings for aborting children all the way up until to the time of delivery, I just decided that I've had enough,"" she said.
Joy is a doctor's wife and mother of four grown children who has never run for political office before. She says as a Christian and life-long resident of New York, she couldn't stand by and do nothing. ""Our country is built on this Judeo-Christian foundation and I see in the House of Representatives we have professed socialists, socialists do not respect human life, socialists do not respect freedom,"" Joy said.
Running for Love of Family
Beth Parlato, whose campaign ad features her big Italian family passing around grandma's pasta and meatballs, says it's her love of family and family values that compelled her to run in New York's 27th Congressional district.
 
""As a Conservative and as a Christian, the family is everything to me, my kids are everything. What kind of world are we going to have for our children and my grandchildren if we don't do something about what's going on in our nation right now?"" Parlato asked. 
Although Joy and Parlato have plenty of passion, what they'll need come election day are votes and as the new kids on the block, they face an uphill battle. 
Taking on a Career Politician
Liz Joy is running in a Democratic stronghold against incumbent Paul Tonko, a 70-year old career politician, who has held the seat since 2009. He voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which protects babies who survive a botched abortion. He voted that those infant children should not receive any medical care. He's also a strong supporter of Planned Parenthood. 
""I'm deeply concerned regarding the misguided fixation to take away valuable resources from women with efforts to de-fund Planned Parenthood,"" Tonko said. 
Joy says Tonko's abortion views are too extreme for many New Yorkers, even some Democrats.
 
""I am conservative but I am also pro-choice but I think that was too aggressive,"" said one local businesswoman. 
Ben said, ""this kind of decision is between women and their doctors and not male legislators.""
When asked if she was ok being a resident of a state with some of the most aggressive abortion laws in the nation, Rose Mary said, ""Well, yes. Because I think the government should really get out of making that decision."" And Larry, from upstate New York, said, ""I don't like it. I think taking a human life is wrong and I don't think inconvenience is something that should justify that.""
Meanwhile, Beth Parlato is running in the state's most Republican district, New York's 27th just outside of Buffalo. The attorney, former judge and Fox News contributor will try to fill the seat previously held by Republican Chris Collins. Collins recently resigned before pleading guilty to charges related to insider trading. ""The election to win in this election is the primary,"" said Parlato. ""So whoever gets through the Primary will be the next Congressman or woman."" 
One Election Away from Socialism?
Parlato believes we are one election away from socialism and says there are far too few conservative women in office. 
""We have 13 Republican women in Congress,"" Parlato said. ""There are 90 Democratic women in Congress, so the loudest voices are the voices on the left and we don't even hear anything from the Republican women. We need more Republican women to sit at that table and to get things done for our families, for our nation and really for the voters in New York State in my district,"" said Parlato.
In order to sit at that table, Parlato will have to beat two other Republicans, both current New York State Senators, Robb Ortt and Chris Jacobs. But Parlato believes she has the edge. 
""Everywhere I go, no matter where I speak at, speaking in front of home school groups or conservative Christian groups, or Christian radio or even conservative radio, no matter where I go – the reception has been overwhelming I'm getting enormous support,"" Parlato said.
For Joy, winning in a solidly blue district will depend in large part on the Evangelical turn-out. In 2016 she wrote a book called How to be Salt and Light – The Christian's Guide to Voting. She says if believers will get out and vote they can change the political landscape of America.
""In 2016, the country had the largest Evangelical Christian voting block that ever turned out in the history of the nation to vote and we have Pres. Donald Trump, as a result, a pro-life president and pro-Israel."" Joy said. ""Christians need to be steering the country instead of it being the other way around."" 
Win or lose on election day, Parlato and Joy say this is not the time to be silent. They hope their campaigns will inspire others to let their voices be heard, for such a time as this. The New York Republican Primary is June 23rd.

It's looking like Republicans now have the votes to shut down Democrats' attempt to call witnesses.
The Democrats needed four Republican votes, but two of the ones they were hoping for - Tennessee's Sen. Lamar Alexander and Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski - have now announced they've heard enough and will vote against calling witnesses.
Alexander says the president's actions regarding Ukraine, although inappropriate, don't meet the Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense.
 
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, do favor witnesses, but Senate Democrats would still need two more Republicans to vote with them to call witnesses, and that appears very unlikely at this point. If that fails, a vote to acquit the president could happen as soon as late tonight, or tomorrow.

But there are also reports the trial could stretch into next week, even without witnesses. So at the moment, there's no clear end date.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited with Ukrainian President Zelensky Friday, saying the US remains committed to supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia.
And President Trump blasted the impeachment efforts Thursday night at a rally in Iowa. ""The Democrats are trying to overturn the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat,"" Trump said. 
The president also attacked what he calls ""radical socialist"" Democratic candidates. 
On the Democrat side, some strategists and even some Democratic politicians are concerned about the rise of self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders in the polls in Iowa and other key states. They worry Sanders might win early races and capture the party's nomination but then lose the general election to the president."

Virginia Democrats Dismantle Abortion Restrictions as Bills Advance in State Legislature

LATEST: Liberty Counsel Says New VA LGBTQ Bill Would Mean Baptist Schools Can't Fire Cross-Dressing Teachers
One of the first orders of business for the new majority was ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. The federal deadline to do so passed decades ago, but now Virginia's attorney general and two other states are suing to have it added to the US Constitution.
That was followed by gun restrictions many thought impossible in this traditionally gun-friendly state. Then came new protections for LGBTQ people.
It's astounding considering where the state was just one year ago. Virginia and the nation was shocked after this exchange that revealed a Democratic push to allow abortion up until the moment of birth.
READ: Virginia Democrats Dismantle Abortion Restrictions as Bills Advance in State Legislature
""Where it's obvious a woman is about to give birth, she has physical signs that she is about to give birth,"" asked Republican Delegate Todd Gilbert of his colleague Democratic Delegate Kathy Tran in a committee meeting. ""Would that still be a point that she could request an abortion if she was so certified? She's dilating."" 
""My bill would allow that, yes,"" Tran replied.
That measure failed, but this is a new year. Now Democrats are eagerly rolling back laws intended to reduce abortions, such as the 24 hour waiting period, a required ultrasound before an abortion so a woman can see her child, and information about alternatives. 
""We are discussing repealing provisions that have been added on over the past 20 years that shame women, that impair their ability to make their own decisions,"" said Democratic state Senator Jennifer Boysko during emotional debate on the Senate floor this week.
Republicans argue taking away these tools puts women back in the dark. 
""Instead of informing and educating women. We're telling them, for 24 hours you don't need to know the information in that ultrasound, make a decision without having all of the facts. I thought we were about empowering women,"" argued Republican Senator Amanda Chase.
Soon nurse practitioners and physicians assistants will be allowed to perform abortions instead of just doctors.
While many Virginians are surprised at the speedy changes, it's exactly what Democrats promised on the campaign trail leading to their historic victory.
""If we have a majority, the work of a lifetime is the work of two afternoons,"" Democratic Delegate Alfonso Lopez explained to voters over the summer.
 
Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who is a pediatric neurologist by trade, is expected to sign the new abortion policies into law, along with the other laws passed by a legislative majority focused on bringing its vision the Old Dominion.
Last year Northam was accused of promoting infanticide for saying it's okay to allow sick babies to die after they've been born.

The GOP senators are facing a decision over whether to call for more witnesses or acquit. Several media outlets are reporting they are on the verge of bringing a quick and sudden end to the proceedings on Capitol Hill. 
Thursday was the final day of questions and answers before the crucial vote on calling witnesses which is expected Friday.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) tried to expose the name of the still anonymous whistleblower in the public trial but was unsuccessful. 
Putting forward his question to Chief Justice John Roberts, Roberts looked at the question and then responded: ""The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted.""  He did not say what was in the note. 
Roberts had earlier told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he did not want to read the whistle blower's name.
""I don't know who the whistleblower is. Adam Schiff doesn't know who the whistleblower is. My question's not about the whistleblower,"" Paul said. ""My question's about two people who were friends who worked together at the National Security Council who have been overheard talking about impeaching the president years in advance.""
But the big question of the day is do the Democrats have enough votes to call witnesses? 
""We need the four votes,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) House impeachment manager. ""First, the Republicans can call any witness they want right now. What they are afraid of is the witnesses we've asked for.  And so that is the first step. Now if we get the four votes – I imagine there would be some negotiations.""
 ""It seems like every question, if not every other question, gets back to the fundamental issue of relevant documents, relevant witnesses, and I think that the other side was having great trouble for days now explaining why there weren't for witnesses or documents and that got even more difficult in light of the Bolton disclosures,"" said Sen. Bob Casey, (D-PA)
""Did the House try to follow up on any of their witnesses or getting witnesses or subpoenas to the courts during that 33 days that Nancy Pelosi held onto their articles of impeachment? And the answer was no. And so now for them to claim they need witnesses when they didn't do their job in the House is just wrong,"" said Rep. Debbie Lesko, (R-AZ)
Democrats especially want to call former National Security Advisor John Bolton to testify. His upcoming book reportedly claims the president held back aid to Ukraine to pressure it to investigate his possible political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
However, there seems to be growing optimism among the Republican senators that they have the momentum to shut down the trial, but exactly how that proceeds is still anyone's guess. 
""I think, by that time, people will have heard enough,"" Sen. John Barrasso, (R-WY), told ""Fox News @ Night."" ""They will have learned what they need to know about this case. And the plan is for Friday to vote. And the momentum is moving to say we've heard enough. Let's move to final judgment."""

But now three Democrat state attorneys general want to change that ruling. They are suing the archivist of the United States to force him to recognize Virginia's vote this week to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and certify the measure as part of the Constitution. 
The lawsuit filed Thursday comes after the National Archives and Records Administration said this week that the archivist would ""take no action to certify the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment,"" which would prohibit discrimination based on sex. 
The three attorneys general, Mark Herring of Virginia, Kwame Raoul of Illinois, and Aaron Ford of Nevada argue that US laws do not give the archivist the power to decide whether to certify an amendment.

Virginia Passed the ERA Even Though the Justice Dept Says It's Dead
Justice Dept. Says 1972 Equal Rights Amendment Is Dead, 'States and Congress Cannot Resurrect It'
Amendment Can't Be Legally Resurrected
In its 38-page opinion published on Jan. 20, the Justice Department said recent efforts at ratification by Virginia Democrats to revive the ERA are futile. The Office of Legal Counsel, which are the in-house lawyers for the Executive Branch of the federal government, said the time limit Congress put on the ratification process back in the 1970s was valid and has long since passed, according to The Washington Times. 
No action by state legislatures or Congress can resurrect it, the Justice Department said. 
Last week, Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA, even though Congress set a 1982 deadline for its ratification. The move by Virginia Democrats is being called ""virtue signaling"" or ""showmanship"" since the ERA has been ruled long dead. 
""We conclude that Congress had the constitutional authority to impose a deadline on the ratification of the ERA and, because that deadline has expired, the ERA Resolution is no longer pending before the states,"" Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel wrote.
The act's original intent was to give women equal rights. But critics say it's poorly written, overly broad, and will have unintended consequences that could affect everything from abortion to maternity leave - even women's sports.
Amendment Would Take Away Opportunities for Women 
During an interview with CBN News earlier this month, Senior Counsel Matt Sharp with Alliance Defending Freedom said the ERA would add sex as a protected classification under the Constitution. 
""It would result in men being allowed to compete in women's sports and take away opportunities for women. It can also be used to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right and force taxpayers to pay for it,"" he explained. 
Sharp added that the Constitution already offers women multiple protections.
""There is the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, ensuring that every American is treated equally under the law and we have numerous federal laws already on the books such as Title 9 and others that ensure women cannot be discriminated against,"" he noted. ""What the ERA is going to do is actually undermine some of those existing protections and erode the hard-fought gains that women have made over the years.""
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to ERA Supporters: 'Start Over'
""The ERA is legally dead and this is an opinion shared by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who recently opined that if the ERA proponents want to see this, they need to start over because this deadline is decades long gone,"" Sharp added. ""This is a last-minute push by activists who ignored that deadline. This is a failed effort to try and push something that the states have ultimately rejected and they decided they didn't want in our Constitution.""
Sharp believes ERA supporters could try to push this case all the way to the US Supreme Court.
""I think the other side is obviously very motivated. This may end up in the Supreme Court, but I think we can all agree that this deadline has passed. Even if it had not, the ERA is a bad law that we should not be pushing for to add to our Constitution,"" he concluded."

President Trump spoke at the march, making history as the first sitting president to attend in person.
""Young people are the heart of the march for life and it's your generation that is making America the pro-life, pro-woman nation,"" Trump said from the podium.
Those 200 students, invited by march organizers, came from Colorado Christian University, a small, private school in the Denver area.   
""We believe that every single human life is inherently valuable, whether that's in the womb, whether that's at the end of life too,"" Ethan Van Buskirk, a CCU student and president of CCU for Life, told CBN News.
And this younger interest seems to be a growing trend.
A Marist/Knights of Columbus poll from February 2019 showed a significant shift among people under the age of 45. That January, 28 percent identified as pro-life. Just one month later, that number jumped to 47 percent. Those identifying as pro-choice fell drastically, from 65 to 48 percent.
Pollsters credit the shift to last year's debate over late-term abortion, fueled by measures in New York and Virginia.
""The more people I talk to, the more I am starting to learn that, yes, we're not alone in this,"" Jessica Hardman, another CCU student, told CBN News. ""There are more people than we think.""
Hardman and her peers point to science, technology and their faith as the main reasons behind their views.
""For me personally, I would say my faith is what inspires me to be specifically passionate about life,"" said Katie McTavish. ""I believe in a God who has created life that every human being has value.""
Other data though does still show strong support for abortion among Millennials.
In a Gallup poll from last January, 32 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds said abortion should be legal under any circumstance. That compares to 21 percent of those 55 and older who felt the same way.
Still, the students from CCU said they can't help but notice what's happening around them.
""I absolutely think it's growing,"" Hardman said of the pro-life movement. ""Last year my school took 27 students (to the March for Life) and this year we took almost 200."""

Until now, senators acting as jurors in the trial have had to remain silent. This was the first chance to ask questions, but on a grand scale. Senators must ask written questions only. Then they must pass them on to Chief Justice John Roberts who reads them aloud to the entire Senate. 
Three out of the four Republicans who could end up siding with Democrats in calling for documents and more witnesses in the trial got to ask the first question. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) posed a question to the White House defense team around motives.

Trump's Legal Team Accuses Democrats of Trying to Unseat a Duly Elected Leader
Chief Justice Roberts read the question aloud ahead of the White House response. 
""How should the Senate consider more than one motive in its assessment of article 1? If there were a motive that was of public interest but also of some personal interest, we think it follows even more clearly that that cannot possibly be the basis of an impeachable defense.""
White House lawyer Pat Philbin responded there's nothing wrong with the president acting on a personal as well as national interest. He declared the charge against Trump ""absurd.""
One of the most important questions hanging over the trial, in general, is whether it matters if there was a quid pro quo behind the US financial aid gifted to Ukraine. That's a question Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) asked the president's defense team. 
Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a member of the White House legal team, jumped at the answer.
""Quid pro quo – If you don't do it, you don't get the money. If you do it you get the money. There's no one in this chamber that would regard that as in any way unlawful. The only thing that would make a quid pro quo unlawful is if the quo was in some way illegal,"" Dershowitz replied. 
In short, this could take a while. In fact, senators have a total of 16 hours to pose questions to both sides.
The Big Question: Will Witnesses Be Called? 
Another big question looming over all of this is whether or not the Senate will call more witnesses. 
The vote on witnesses is expected to be held on Friday. But even that won't ensure witnesses will be called. There will be a separate vote held for each individual witness. 
Democrats are looking for eyewitnesses – people they describe as being ""in the room,"" including former National Security Advisor John Bolton. 
Republicans are floating the idea of calling former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden, but that's something Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) hit back at today.
""It's a terrible argument for the president here. The House managers have argued that the president was willing to risk our national security and risk the sanctity of our elections to go after Joe Biden and his son. Now they're saying we even want to risk the solemnity of a trial in the Senate on impeachment to go after Biden and his son – it's irrelevant,"" Schumer said. ""It's a distraction. It's running away from the truth and it's up to the Republicans and solely the Republicans to do it – we're not for it.""
The Democrats' push to call Bolton as a witness comes amid reports of Bolton's soon to be released tell-all book. But its publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to ""significant amounts of classified information"" in the manuscript, including at the top-secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted that the book does not contain any classified information.
Democrats on the Hill are warning that senators will be kicking themselves for not asking for more evidence after Bolton's book, which they say will provide key relevant information for the trial. "

But now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is warning that enough Republicans may join the Democrats to demand witnesses testify, adding some major uncertainty to the next phase.
Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney, took a dismissive swipe at an unpublished book by John Bolton that is said to contradict a key defense argument.
“It is not a game of leaks and un-sourced manuscripts,"" said Sekulow. “That's politics, unfortunately.""
He was referring to media reports about a soon to be released book by Trump's former national security adviser, who writes that Trump told him that he wanted to withhold military aid from Ukraine until it helped with investigations into Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly insisted he never tied the security aid to political investigations.
One of the president's lawyers, Deputy White House Counsel Pat Philbin, told the senators that America's Founding Fathers took care to make sure that impeachment was narrowly defined, with impeachable offenses clearly enumerated.
“There has to be a defined offense in advance,"" Philbin said.
Democrats Demanding Witnesses After Bolton Leak
Democrats have demanded witnesses since the Senate trial began, and now some Republicans are expressing openness to the idea. 
In response, one Republican, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, is floating an idea to subpoena Bolton’s book manuscript so senators can see the evidence themselves – but only in private.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) wrote on Twitter that he “totally” supports Lankford's proposal. Graham, a key Trump ally, said the Bolton document should be made available to the Senate, in a classified setting, “where each Senator has the opportunity to review the manuscript and make their own determination.""
However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), called the proposal, which would keep Bolton out of public testimony, “absurd.""  He said, “We're not bargaining with them. We want four witnesses, and four sets of documents, then the truth will come out.""
News of the possible Bolton revelations distracted from hours of arguments Monday by Trump's lawyers, who declared anew that no witness has testified to direct knowledge that Trump's delivery of aid was contingent on investigations into Democrats. 
“We deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information,"" Sekulow reminded senators. “We do not deal with speculation.""
Trump is charged with abusing his presidential power by asking Ukraine's leader to help investigate Biden at the same time his administration was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid. A second charge accuses Trump of obstructing Congress in its probe.
Even as defense lawyers laid out their case as planned, it was clear Bolton's book had scrambled the debate over whether to seek witnesses. Trump's legal team has rejected Bolton's account, and Trump himself denied it. 
“I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,"" Trump tweeted. ""If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.”
Next Phase of the Trial
In the next phase of the trial, senators will get the chance to ask questions of both the House impeachment managers and the president's lawyers during a 16-hour period that will begin in the next day or so. 
The Senate majority and minority will go back and forth posting written questions that will be read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts. 
After the question and answer period, impeachment managers and the president's legal team will debate new evidence and call any new witnesses.
McConnell Facing a Mutiny Over Witnesses?
Senate Majority Leader McConnell told senators privately Tuesday he does not yet have the votes to block new witnesses in the trial.
McConnell convened a closed-door meeting of GOP senators shortly after Trump’s legal team made its closing arguments in the trial, the third and final day of defense proceedings punctuated by revelations from John Bolton, the former national security adviser. A Republican familiar with the meeting was not authorized to describe it by name and requested anonymity, according to The Associated Press. 
The GOP leader faced a handful of potential defections, but several days remained before any potential witness vote would be taken.
A decision to call more witnesses would need 51 votes to pass. With a 53-seat majority, Republicans can only afford to lose three Republicans to prevent more debate over witnesses."

The Iowa caucuses kick-off the Democratic contests that will decide the party's presidential candidate for 2020.
Sanders seems increasingly confident in his ability to win in Iowa. That's creating problems for his more moderate rivals, like Vice President Joe Biden, about how to take on Sanders directly.
""Suddenly, we have the Democratic establishment very nervous about this campaign. We got Wall Street nervous,"" Sanders told a crowd in Sioux City, according to NBC News. ""They're starting to think, could this really happen?""
On Monday, Biden indirectly targeted Sanders about the multi-trillion-dollar cost of his single-payer health insurance, tuition-free college, and broad climate plans. ""I don't think you win votes doing that. I think it scares the living devil out of people,"" Biden said while visiting Cedar Falls, Iowa.
Many Democrats worry that if Sanders gets the party's nomination, he won't be able to beat President Trump in the general election.
""He is a front-runner to win, and if he wins it's going to be incredibly hard to beat Trump and hang onto our House majority,"" said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of the think tank called Third Way.
A new New York Times/Siena College poll shows Sanders with a slight edge in Iowa. But other polls show him neck-and-neck with other candidates.
Sanders is also leading in New Hampshire. An NBC10 Boston/Franklin Pierce/Herald Poll shows Sanders with 29 percent support, followed by Biden at 22 percent, Elizabeth Warren at 16 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 10 percent, and Amy Klobuchar at 5 percent. The Iowa caucuses take place on Feb. 3 and New Hampshire Democrats hold their primary on Feb. 11.
It's worth noting that polls are not a solid prediction of outcomes in caucuses and primaries. The poll numbers can shift from day to day, especially in the aftermath of previous contests. In addition, please note that CBN does not endorse or oppose any candidate for political office.

The Virginia House on Monday advanced legislation that allows nurse practitioners and certified nurse-midwives to perform abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy.
""This law does not appear to limit when someone other than a physician can perform any kind of abortion,"" Virginia House Republican Leader Del. Todd Gilbert pointed out during the debate on the bill.
""These individuals are highly trained and qualified and, indeed Madame Speaker, some of them have to train under a physician for a period of time,"" Virginia House Democrat Leader Del. Charniele Herring responded. 
Democrats now control both houses of the legislature and governor's mansion.
The new majority also plan to put a stop to the Commonwealth's current 24-hour waiting period and requiring ultrasounds before abortions, which have proven successful in reducing the number of abortions.
Similar legislation is moving through the state senate.
Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist by trade, is expected to sign the legislation into law.
CORRECTION: This story originally stated that Virginia Democrats were also trying to remove the requirement that minors get parental consent before aborting their child. CBN News has confirmed that the measure is no longer part of the legislation."

The former national security advisor claims President Trump tied Ukraine security aid to investigating the Bidens.
President Trump's legal team said the commander-in-chief was acting under his constitutional and legal authority, adding that asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of corruption is not breaking the law.

Trump's Legal Team Accuses Democrats of Trying to Unseat a Duly Elected Leader
""I want to keep coming back to facts, facts that are really undisputed,"" said Jay Sekulow, Trump's attorney. ""The president in his conversation was clear on a number of points but so was President Zelensky. I mentioned that at the close of my arguments earlier, it was President Zelensky that said, 'No pressure. I didn't feel any pressure.'"" 
But contradicting to Sekulow's opening argument Monday, the New York Times reported they received an unpublished transcript of Bolton's upcoming book.
In it, Bolton writes President Trump told him in August of last year that he wanted to continue withholding military aid to Ukraine until they launched investigations into the Bidens.
""Not true,"" said Trump as he fielded questions outside the Oval Office. ""Well, I haven't seen a manuscript but I can tell you nothing was ever said to John Bolton. But I have not seen the manuscript. I guess he is writing a book. I have not seen it."" 
White House Counsel Prof. Alan Dershowitz told the Senate on Monday, ""Nothing in the Bolton revelations even if true would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called this revelation a ""White House cover-up,"" while pointing to his counterpart across the aisle for the need to hear from Bolton during the trial. 
""This is stunning. It goes right to the heart of the charges against the president,"" Schumer said. ""Ambassador Bolton essentially confirms the president committed the offenses charged in the first article of impeachment. It boils down to one thing. We have a witness with first-hand evidence of the president's actions for which he is on trial.""
Bolton has said he would testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. Now some Republican senators have also come out saying let him testify.
""I've said for some time I'd like to be able to hear from John Bolton,"" said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT). ""I think with the story that came out yesterday, it's increasingly important to hear from John Bolton.  I will make a final decision on witnesses after we've heard from the prosecution but also the defense. But I think pretty fair to say that John Bolton has a relevant testimony to provide to those of us who are sitting in impartial justice.""
With support growing from both sides, it appears likely the Senate could hear from witnesses.
There are reports that GOP leaders are receptive to a suggestion by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey to allow one prosecution witness in exchange for one defense witness. The question on witnesses could be decided later this week. The president's legal team is expected to wrap up opening arguments today."

On Sunday, the Democratic presidential candidate participated in a town hall event on Fox News, where he fielded a question from Kristen Day, a pro-life Democrat wondering how her party could make room for progressive voters like her.
“Do you want the support of pro-life Democrats, pro-life Democratic voters?” she asked Buttigieg. “There are about 21 million of us, and if so, would you support more moderate platform language in the Democratic Party to ensure that the party of diversity and inclusion really does include everybody?”
“I hope to earn your vote,” the 37-year-old candidate replied, “but I’m not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you.”
That is a big step from a candidate who has spent months avoiding even entertaining the question of abortion, often telling his questioners the morality of the procedure is simply “unknowable.”
Buttigieg told Day that while they couldn’t come to a consensus on “where to draw the line” when it comes to abortion, he hoped they could maybe agree “on who should draw the line, and in my view, it’s the woman who’s faced with that decision in her own life.”
FAITHWIRE  Buttigieg Says His Christian Faith Inspires Him to Work Towards a World Without Weapons
Unsatisfied with Buttigieg’s answer, Fox News moderator Chris Wallace gave Day a second shot at her question. She asked the former mayor if he would be “open” to making the Democratic Party’s platform on abortion more “diverse and inclusive,” particularly for pro-life progressives, because, as she said, they “have no part in the party.”
Buttigieg toed the party line.
“I support the position of my party,” he said, “that this kind of medical care needs to be available to everyone, and I support the Roe v. Wade framework that holds that, early in pregnancy, there are very few restrictions, and late in pregnancy, there are very few exceptions, and again, the best I can offer is that we may disagree on that very important issue, and hopefully, we will be able to partner on other issues.”

GOP Sen. Mitt Romney led the way saying it is “increasingly apparent it is important to hear” from former national security adviser John Bolton about a leak from his upcoming book that appears to undercut a key defense argument.
GOP Sen. Susan Collins agreed about calling Bolton, tweeting, ""I’ve always said that I was likely to vote to call witnesses, just as I did in the 1999 Clinton trial."" 
In The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir, The New York Times reports Bolton writes that President Trump ""wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens.""
But Deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura asked how there could have been a quid quo with Ukraine when the Ukrainians were not even aware that the security assistance was paused. 
Purpura told the Senate, ""There can't be a threat without the person knowing he's being threatened. There can't be a quid pro quo without the quo.""
President Trump flatly denied the claims from Bolton's book, tweeting, 
""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.""

Saturday, President Trump's lawyers began their defense in the impeachment trial.
The president's attorney Jay Sekulow told senators, ""We intend to show over the next several days that the evidence is actually really overwhelming that the President did nothing wrong.""
And as for the charge of obstruction of Congress, White House Deputy Counsel Patrick Philbin said the subpoenas issued by Schiff's committees were invalid because they were not authorized by the full House, ""because under long-settled precedent, there had to be a vote from the House to have authority and the administration would not respond to subpoenas which were invalid.""
Meanwhile, President Trump lashed out at House impeachment manager Adam Schiff, tweeting, 
""Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man. He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!
Schiff told NBC's Meet The Press he considered the tweet a threat, telling Meet the Press, ""This is a wrathful and vindictive president. I don't think there's any doubt about it."" 
John Bolton has said he will testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. Democrats say reports about his new book show that Bolton must testify. President Trump says House Democrats should have done their job when it was their responsibility:
The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify. It is up to them, not up to the Senate!

VP Pence to CBN News: Democrats Pushing 'Weak' Impeachment Case to Overturn Devastating Election Loss
Deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura speaking during the impeachment proceedings said his team will present six ""key facts"" that will show the president did nothing wrong when he asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. 
Among those facts Purpura said was that Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Biden matter after raising concerns about potential corruption.
""Everyone knows by now President Trump asked Presidents Zelenskiy to do us a favor and he made clear that the US referred to our country and not himself,"" Purpura argued. ""Presidents Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.""
Jay Sekulow, attorney for President Trump, accused Democratic prosecutors of omitting key evidence when they presented their case and is urging Senate members to acquit his client on charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress.
""This case is really not about presidential wrongdoing,"" Sekulow argued. ""This entire impeachment process is about the House manager's insistence that they are able to read everybody's thoughts. They can read everybody's intention, even when the principal speakers, the witnesses themselves, insist that those interpretations are wrong.""
The first part of Trump's defense lasted only two hours and as soon as the Senate was adjourned, House impeachment managers and other high-ranking Democratic leaders took to the cameras and Twitter accusing Trump's legal team of ""trying to deflect, distract from, and distort the truth.""
Lead impeachment prosecutor, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) tweeted that today's proceedings showed the president's lawyers did not ""contest the facts of Trump's scheme"" while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said, ""I don't think the president's counsel did a very good job - there are gaping holes in their testimony."" 
Schumer added that there was a ""compelling case"" for why the Senate should allow new witnesses to testify and permit new documents to be introduced as part of the Senate's impeachment proceedings.
""We have been making the argument that we need witnesses, we need documents,"" Schumer said during a press conference. ""We are making the argument it won't take very long to get them as part of a trial. Today, we thank the president's counsel for one thing: they made our case even stronger.""

As Democrats pressed their case before skeptical Republican senators for the third day, the president's legal team is preparing its defense, expected to start Saturday.
The Senate jurors faced another long day Friday armed with pens and paper — and, for Republicans, the gift of fidget spinners — for the historic trial.
Before Friday's session began, Senate Chaplain Barry Black prayed, ""Lord guide them with your wisdom... in spite of disagreements may they strive for civility... give them the wisdom to distinguish between facts and opinions.""
Democrat prosecutors have two articles of impeachment they're trying to convince the Senate about, and they spent all of Thursday evening on the first article which claims ""abuse of power"". So they're spending Friday focusing on their second article, claiming the President obstructed their investigation.
GOP senators, who are growing tired of the long hours of the trial, have defended Trump's actions in dealing with Ukraine as appropriate. They consider the impeachment process as a politically motivated effort to weaken him in his reelection campaign. 
Trump's defense team is now arguing that the impeachment articles against him are invalid because the articles do not allege that he committed a specific crime.
The president's attorney Jay Sekulow said, ""We will be putting on a vigorous defense of both facts, rebutting what they said,"" and the Constitution.
The Senate is heading next week toward a pivotal vote on Democratic demands for testimony from top Trump aides, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton who refused to appear before the House. It would take four Republican senators to join the Democratic minority to seek witnesses, and so far the numbers appear lacking.
""This needs to end,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a Trump confidant. He said he doesn't want to hear from Bolton or the Bidens.
During their presentations, Democrats have been summarizing much of the evidence and testimony already presented during televised House impeachment hearings.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) said the Democrats were putting forward ""admirable presentations."" But he said, ""There's just not much new here.""
Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) said it seemed like ""Groundhog Day in the Senate.""
The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer (NY), acknowledged that many senators ""really don't want to be here.""
Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and acquittal of President Trump is considered likely. "

""President Trump used the powers of his office to solicit a foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own personal benefit. Note that the act of solicitation itself, just the ask, constitutes an abuse of power. But President Trump went further.""
Republican senators, who hold a majority in the chamber and will vote on Trump's conviction or acquittal, exhibited no reaction.

Here Are the Senate Rules for Trump's Trial and How McConnell Plans to Expedite It
The Democratic prosecutors argued in the impeachment trial before skeptical Republican senators and a watchful American public that Trump sought a political investigation of Biden from Ukraine for his own gain to sway the 2020 election in his favor.
Ahead of the day's proceedings, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said the Democrats were putting forward ""admirable presentations."" But he said, ""They've basically got about one hour of presentation, and they gave it six times on Tuesday and eight times yesterday. There's just not much new here.""
Trump blasted the proceedings in a Thursday morning tweet, declaring them the ""Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!""
The question of calling witnesses will be worked out after the president's team has 24 hours to present their case. The strategy of more witnesses, though, seemed all but settled. Republicans rejected Democratic efforts to get Trump aides including former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, to testify in back-to-back votes earlier this week.
Senators appear likely to repeat that rejection next week.
""I want to end this thing sooner rather than later. I don't want to turn it into a circus,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). ""I think Schumer said yesterday he wouldn't trade Joe Biden. I think I know why. I want the American people to pick the next president, not me. So I think the best thing is to have oversight of Ukrainian misconduct and move on to the election.

David Brody: ""Democrats want to see John Bolton testify.  Do you have any reason to believe John Bolton has any information that would be worthy of bringing him forward?
Vice President Mike Pence:  ""I think all the call for additional witnesses and evidence just proves how a weak a case the Democrats have rushed through the House of Representatives.  It really is amazing. This comes down to a phone call that the President made with President Zelensky of Ukraine.  People can read the transcript of the call and see there was no quid-pro-quo.  The President did nothing wrong.  Beyond that the Democrats rushed this partisan impeachment through the House and now having sat on their partisan impeachment for a month, they come to the Senate having told us that they have an overwhelming case against the president saying now they need new evidence, they need new witnesses.  And I hold the view that the Senate ought to evaluate this partisan impeachment, the articles, the evidence that were amassed in the House, look at everything that they've brought over and make their decision.  I think that when they look at those facts, this president will be acquitted and frankly we'll put this chapter, this partisan impeachment in the rearview mirror and maybe, just maybe get the Democrats in Congress to begin to Focus on the things that President Trump and I have always focused on, every day of this administration – making America more secure, making our borders more secure, making our economy more prosperous, seeing conservatives appointed to our courts at every level, focusing on the things that matter most to the American people.""

David Brody: ""Referring to Ilhan Omar and Rashida Talib, people like that who have said certain things?""
Vice President Mike Pence:  ""For people to traffic in anti-Semitic slurs and tropes and not be held to account for that, it's just not acceptable. But the good news is and you saw it here at the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz, the world is mobilizing, the American people are aware of it. You look at the recent elections in the United Kingdom and it was understood to be the liberal party's tolerance of latent anti-Semitism was seen as one of the reasons why they lost in a landslide in recent elections. I think the people understand the dangers based on the lessons of 75 years ago at even allowing anti-Semitic rhetoric, let alone violence to take place in our society but it requires a constant vigilance. You know when I was a member of Congress, the only Holocaust survivor to ever serve in Congress, the late Tom Lantos, came to my office, David, and asked me to co-found the Anti-Semitism Caucus. I was honored to do that. He wanted to co-found the caucus with an Evangelical Christian and conservative and I was humbled by that and the truth is a rejection of anti-Semitic rhetoric or worse should be universal in our society, in our public debate and we'll continue to demand that."""

""President Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to (Ukraine) a strategic partner at war with Russia to secure foreign help with his reelection,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, (D-CA) lead House impeachment manager argued. ""In other words, to cheat. In this way, the president used official state powers available only to him and unavailable to any political opponent to advantage himself in a democratic election. His scheme was undertaken for a simple but corrupt reason to help him win reelection in 2020. But the effect of his scheme was to undermine our free and fair elections and to put our national security at risk.""
Republicans say the Ukraine case wasn't about the election as much as it was about not sending US money to fund a potentially corrupt situation. At the heart of that case, Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden had been given a key Ukrainian job for which he wasn't qualified.

As Trump Legal Team Takes Stage, Sekulow Uses Schiff's Own Words Against Him
Daily CBN News Coverage of the Senate Impeachment Trial of President Trump
Rich Lowry, the editor of The National Review tweeted, ""I don't get how people who didn't balk at Obama's refusal to give Ukraine lethal aid can as *as a policy matter* object to a brief delay in military aid by Trump as a horrendous blow to Ukraine's defense.""
Before beginning opening statements, dueling press conferences took place on Capitol Hill. Republican senators, House managers, and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate minority leader. 
""Let me point out, the fact that McConnell had to change his resolution showed that Republicans can make this trial more fair if they want to,"" he said. ""It's not a question of ability. They can if they want. It's a question of conscience. Senate Republicans have the power in their hands to make it a fair trial. Will they use it when it matters? The next real test will come after Q and A when we revisit the issue of witnesses and documents.""
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OHIO) responded in a tweet. ""House Dems couldn't be bothered to wait for the Courts to decide on witnesses. They said impeachment was urgent!"" he wrote. ""Now in the Senate, they're admitting how weak their case is by demanding more witnesses.""
House Minority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) also tweeted about Democrats' refusal to go to court, writing: ""A Democrat Impeachment Manager admitted the reason they're doing this is because going to court wouldn't have been quick enough to get this done before the election. Now we know why we're really here: So Dems can try to rig the 2020 election.""
Along with his tweet, Scalise posted a video of Rep. Val Demings (D-FL), another House manager arguing before the Senate last night. 
Also for the first time since the trial began, President Trump spoke about the Senate trial.  He's been overseas the last couple days, but is heading back to Washington tonight. 
Before boarding Air Force One, Trump called a surprise news conference. He lashed out at Democrats in the trial calling it a ""hoax"", adding he'd like to ""sit in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces.""
""I think it's so bad for our country when we have the head of the World Trade Organization here and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect that nobody talks about,"" he said. ""I never see them talking about transcription. I never see them talking about the call because there is nothing to say. You read it. Somebody should sit there and read it and everybody is going to say that is an impeachable event?""
The latest Politico/Morning Consult poll reveals 47% are in favor of Trump's removal from office with 45% opposed. 
President Trump's lawyers will now get three days to make their case that the commander-in-chief did not commit a crime. But first up are Democrat prosecutors who get the same amount of time to prove he did. 
Trump said he supports former National Security Advisor John Bolton and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney testifying during the Senate trial. But in the end, it will be up to the Senate to decide. 
""I'd love to have Mike Pompeo testify but again that is a national security problem,"" he said. ""But it's a national security problem. I'd love to have Rick Perry. Rick Perry has asked me, 'I would love to testify. Please let me testify' because he knows this is a hoax. He understands it better than most. Rick Perry would love to testify. We are dealing with national security.""
Trump's lawyers say House Democrats rushed to impeach without fighting for witnesses in court. The commander-in-chief praised his legal team saying he ""thought they did a very good job."""

The President is in Europe, arriving at the World Economic Forum in Geneva, Switzerland as his impeachment trial got underway. ""We are bringing back tremendous business in the United States and they're all here to see,"" Trump said. ""I'll be making a speech and then we'll be leaving shortly. But I think it's very important. The other is just a hoax. It is a witch hunt that's been going on for years and it's frankly, it's disgraceful.""
Trump's legal team outlined his defense strategy in a brief, arguing the President did ""absolutely nothing wrong"" calling it a ""rigged process.""
They added that Trump is the victim of a partisan plot ""to corrupt the extraordinary power of impeachment for use as a political tool to overturn the result of the 2016 election and to interfere in the 2020 election.""
Are the Charges Sufficient for Impeachment?
""It needs to be criminal behavior, criminal in nature,"" said Alan Dershowitz, a member of the President's legal team. ""The articles of impeachment are two non-criminal actions, namely obstruction of Congress and abuse of power.""
The brief adds ""the framers adopted a standard that requires a violation of established law to state an impeachable offense. By contrast, in their articles of impeachment, House Democrats have not even attempted to identify any law that was violated.""
But some legal scholars state the President doesn't have to break the law to commit an impeachable offense. 
Democrats say ""the facts are indisputable and the evidence is overwhelming"" that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate a political rival. 
""If the President is so confident in his case if Leader McConnell is so confident the President did nothing wrong, why don't they want the case to be presented in broad daylight?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) asked. 
""We believe that once you hear those initial presentations the only conclusion will be that the President has done nothing wrong,"" White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told the senators.  
Cipollone will represent Trump along with his personal attorney Jay Sekulow. 
Sekulow Turns the Tables on Schiff
Tuesday afternoon, Sekulow turned the tables on House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) by quoting his own words against him. 
Schiff was arguing against executive privilege, claiming the president had obstructed the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry by telling his senior aides not to comply with congressional subpoenas that directed them to testify in front of the House committees.
Sekulow reminded Schiff of the words he once used when the Republican-led House held President Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for refusing to release documents relating to Operation Fast and Furious.
Sekulow said, ""Mr. Manager Schiff wrote at the time, 'The White House assertion of privilege is backed by decades of precedent that has recognized the need for the President and his senior advisers to receive candid advice and information from their top aides.'""
""Indeed that's correct,"" Sekulow said, ""Not because Mr. Schiff said it, because the Constitution requires it.""
Meanwhile, House Democrats were calling Cipollone a ""material fact witness"" who should be disqualified from defending the commander-in-chief.
The White House responded calling Democrats an ""utter joke"" saying this move to remove one of Trump's lawyers is a ""political stunt.""
A Prayer from Chaplain Barry Black
With partisanship on full display, even before the afternoon trial session began, Senate Chaplain Barry Black took a moment in his opening prayer to remind all those present and watching on television on whom we can all rely.
""We declare that You alone are our hope,"" Black prayed.
A Rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts
As the arguments went late into the night, a clash over witnesses brought a rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler said, ""President Trump does not want you to hear from Ambassador Bolton. It has nothing to do with executive privilege or this other nonsense.""
Cipollone replied, ""The only one who should be embarrassed Mr. Nadler is YOU.""
Roberts stepped in, ""I think it's important for me to admonish the counsel for both... I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are."""

The Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is limiting some Democrat candidates' time on the campaign trail with less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses.

'I Think You Called Me a Liar on National TV': Amid Sanders-Warren Spat, Dems Worry They Can't Beat Trump
This Moment Is Getting All the Attention from the Final Democrat Debate Before Crucial Iowa Caucus
As Biden and Bernie Battle for Lead Before Big Iowa Caucus, Here's What's Giving Dems Headaches
Now, they're compelled to stay in Washington, DC, at least while the trial is in session. They're also forbidden from using electronic devices on the Senate floor.
Instead, the candidates have deployed surrogates to do their bidding in Iowa. 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a far-left Democrat from New York, will appear in Iowa this weekend on behalf of Sanders. ""Queer Eye"" host Jonathan Van Ness will also be in Iowa stumping for Warren, in addition to Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who will be in New Hampshire.
And more than a dozen supporters of Klobuchar, for instance, held a news conference on Tuesday on the steps of the New Hampshire state capitol.
Polls show Joe Biden leading in Iowa with Warren close behind and Sanders and Klobuchar within shouting distance.
Biden, 77, will have Iowa completely to himself for a final campaign push in his third bid for the presidency as his Democrat colleagues hear the impeachment trial in the Senate.
Biden and Sanders' durability in their late 70s has surprised many Democrats and prompted questions about representation and electability in a party that will count on high turnout among women, minorities and young voters in November's general election.
With the first caucus and primary votes yet to be cast, Democrat sentiment could still quickly turn against any of the candidates. 
Other campaigns have been grappling with how best to cut into the support of frontrunners like Biden and Sanders. Some political pundits place Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the more moderate camp, which pits him against Biden in the battle for moderate voters.
Meanwhile, progressive favorites Warren and Sanders have clashed a bit, but both tried to back away from the first rift that emerged last week: a disagreement over whether Sanders told Warren in a private meeting that a woman can't beat Trump."

Trial rules allow each side 24 hours to present their case over three days. House managers begin their prosecution when proceedings pick back up today as the jury of senators sits silently and listens.
Democrats are demanding the Senate call up new witnesses to testify against Trump in the Senate trial. Republicans say Democrats already called up their own witness during the House hearings and they seem unlikely to call up new ones.

Democrats Take Steps to Undermine Electoral College after Hillary Clinton's 2016 Loss to Trump
Another State Rejects Electoral College as Democrats Advance Effort to Win 2020 Presidential Race
Why There Would Be No America without the Electoral College
There's been an effort nationwide, led mainly by members of the Democrat Party, to bypass or abolish the original intent of the Electoral College. The effort has escalated since the 2016 election in which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote while Donald Trump won in enough states to win the Electoral College and the presidency.
READ: Why There Would Be No America without the Electoral College
In all, five presidents in American history have won office while losing the popular vote, including two of the last three: Trump and George W. Bush, according to The New York Times. 
The current system requires a presidential candidate to win the states, not just individual voters. That ensures less-populated states still have a voice.
Experts say the Founders created the Electoral College to make sure smaller states had a say in picking the person who would be their national leader. ""If you go back to the Framers, they wanted an Electoral College because they wanted to create a balance between the heavily-populated and less-populated areas of the country,"" The Heritage Foundation's elections expert Hans von Spakovsky told CBN News. 
""And they were afraid that if a president was elected by a national popular vote, the candidates would only go to the big cities,"" he continued. ""They would ignore the rural areas - you know, the places that folks in New York call 'flyover country'.""
As CBN News reported last March, even some of the Democrat candidates for president have called for the Electoral College to be abolished. 
""We can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said. 
So far, 15 states and the District of Columbia have passed NPVIC legislation.
Colorado was one of those states that passed the measure.  Jerry Sonnenberg, a Colorado Republican state senator, told The Times he opposed the bill because he believed the change would weaken the electoral power of sparsely populated rural states like Wyoming and Utah while strengthening states like California and New York.
In his view, the Electoral College was created so that ""people in rural areas did not get overrun by the masses.""
""I think it's completely appropriate that we keep the Electoral College,"" he said."

A member of the president's legal team, constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz, believes the Democrats' case against Trump is basically dead on arrival in the Senate because the House charged the president on a non-impeachable offense.

As White House Prepares Defense, Senate Republicans Plan Speedy Trial
Dershowitz told ABC's ""ThisWeek"" program, ""You have a lot of evidence, disputed evidence that could go either way, but the vote was to impeach for abuse of power, which is not within the constitutional criteria for impeachment."" 
House Impeachment Manager Rep. Adam Schiff says, ""Abuse of power is at the center of what the Framers intended an impeachable offense to be.""
But Dershowitz says, ""Half of American presidents have been accused by their political enemies of abusing their power. The Framers didn't want to have that kind of criteria in the Constitution because it weaponizes impeachment for partisan purposes.""
While the idea of instantly dismissing the impeachment articles is off the table, Dershowitz says there may be no need for witnesses if his opening argument succeeds.
Some senators say opening the door to more witnesses could stretch the trial out to as long as two months.
Republican Sen. Ted Cruz (TX) told Fox News, ""I think it's certainly possible for this trial to only go one or two weeks. On the other hand, if the Senate makes a decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it to 6, 8 weeks or even longer. So, I think there are two paths here.""

Pelosi Gloats 'the President Is Impeached for Life', Giuliani Says Senate Can Undo It
The Trial of Trump Begins: Pelosi's Prosecutors Read House Impeachment Charges in Senate
Each senator, for their part, took both an oral and written oath to do impartial justice.
Opening arguments began Tuesday afternoon and the big question is what strategy will Democratic impeachment managers, led by Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), employ.
Democrats say there's new evidence to examine, including newly released information from former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas who says there's no question the president wanted to convince Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic presidential political opponent. 
""President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president,"" Parnas told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.
From the Oval Office, President Trump again called the process partisan and denied Parnas' claims.
""Don't know where he comes from, know nothing about him. I can only tell you this thing is a big hoax,"" the president told reporters.
4 Republicans and 2 Democrats to Watch
A top priority of the House impeachment managers will be to convince moderate Republican senators to allow witnesses. The four senators to watch are Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Mitt Romney (R-UT), and Lamar Alexander (R-TN).
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Fox News he's concerned some of those Republican senators might try to allow the Democrats' witnesses to testify against Trump while blocking key witnesses who could testify on his behalf.
Two Democratic senators will also be key players. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Doug Jones of Alabama represent states where Trump is popular and may vote in his favor in the end.
Despite Washington intrigue about the trial, the president is widely expected to be acquitted. That's because it takes a super-majority of seven senators to convict. That would require Democrats to convince 20 Republicans to vote against the president.

The president previewed his idea earlier this month at the Evangelicals for Trump rally at the King Jesus International Ministry in Florida, saying he would take action to safeguard students' and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in school.
""We will not allow faithful Americans to be bullied by the hard Left,"" Trump said.
The president told CBN News' David Brody at the White House Thursday, ""Well, it is a cultural war. You have two sides. You have a side that believes so strongly in prayer and they're being restricted and it's getting worse and worse and I think we've made a big impact. And we're loosening up a lot and I want to loosen it up totally. But you do have things happening today that 10 or 15 years ago would have been unthinkable, what's happening.""
Now the US Department of Education is sending letters to officials in all 50 states to ensure students and teachers don't face discrimination for practicing their right of religious freedom. 
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos explained the new rules protect students' right to pray, but they also go beyond that to protect faith-based student groups and much more: ""The Department's efforts will level the playing field between religious and non-religious organizations competing for federal grants, as well as protect First Amendment freedoms on campus and the religious liberty of faith-based institutions.""
White House Domestic Policy Director Joe Grogan said, ""We're going to be making it clear that students have the right to pray publicly in school if they so choose.""
Due to cases where the law has been misunderstood, today's announcement reinforces what's on the books. Grogan says it will ""remind the chief education officers in all 50 states that students have the right to pray at their own direction, to gather at their own direction, to bring the Bible to school if they choose to, to bring the Koran or the Torah in.""
The bottom line is this: Public schools now risk losing federal funds if they violate students' rights to religious expression.
The prayer announcement comes on Religious Freedom Day, an annual event held on January 16 to mark America's long history of protecting religious liberty going all the way back to the 1786 passage of Thomas Jefferson's Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom.
""A society without religion cannot prosper. A nation without faith cannot endure, because justice, goodness and peace cannot prevail without the glory of Almighty God,"" Trump said this month at his evangelical rally. ""For America to thrive in the 21st Century we must renew faith and family as the center of American life.""
""These angry radicals want to impose absolute conformity by censoring speech, tearing down crosses and symbols of faith and banning religious believers from public life,"" he said. ""But we will not back down, we are standing tall for the values that we hold dear.""
""I will be taking action to safeguard students' and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools,"" Trump said. ""They want to take that right along with many other rights.""
""My administration will never stop fighting for Americans of faith,"" he said. ""I really do believe we have God on our side.""
Franklin Graham tweeted, ""Thank you President Trump for protecting and empowering the right to student-led prayer in schools.""
Dr. David Jeremiah, pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church, praised the president's effort to defend the right to pray in school.
""President Trump has made the right decision to give America's children permission to pray again in our public schools. It's absurd that generations of our children, in our public schools, have been raised to think that there's little to no place for faith outside of one's church, one's home or one's heart. Our public schools ought to be places where people of faith feel free to be who they are, and -of course- no one really believes doing so constitutes enforcing one's personal faith on another. Our founding fathers would be utterly astonished that the one thing we thought wise was to deprive our children of their faith through America's education system. Can't we just agree that America is better off when people of faith pray, beginning with our children?""

Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said, ""For years, we've watched secularists pressure school administrators into telling students that they can't pray, read their Bibles, or talk about their faith in class. Some school officials are willing participants in the secularists' intimidation campaign while others fear the lack of funding to fight threatened lawsuits. Now the tables are turned. The onus is now on states to certify that they are compliant with U.S. Department of Education guidelines which protect students' religious freedom. If schools fail to protect religious freedom, they now run the risk of losing federal funding. With this and his other announced rules, President Trump is continuing the drumbeat of religious freedom and the long march toward restoring religious freedom in the public square.""
Rev. Johnnie Moore, a commissioner for the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, is applauding the move, saying it's just the latest proof that President Trump is a champion of religious freedom.
""The White House isn't saying whether one should pray or to whom or what they should pray to, they are simply making it clear that in the United States students have First Amendment rights also, and our 'separation of church and state' wasn't intended to suppress a vibrant religious life in America but to facilitate it. Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists, where he referenced this separation, was actually more about protecting the church from the State than the State from the church,"" Moore said.
He says he experienced a taste of the discrimination that other faith-filled students often experience in America's public schools.
""I found my personal faith in middle and high school as my family moved several times among multiple states and I attended multiple public schools. When I became passionate about my Christianity, I decided to start prayer meetings at each of my schools. I generally did so outside of school - before school - because these public schools, even in the Bible Belt, had a total paranoia about the separation of church and state which required us students to pray in the cold or rain, outside,"" Moore recalls.
""Even in those environments that were more open, the approval processes seemed intentionally burdensome. I was once called into a principal's office in one of my high schools for trying to have a Bible study during the lunch hour. It was totally absurd.""

Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, said, ""This is a decision that should be celebrated by Democrats and by Republicans, by the religious and the irreligious, by all Americans from sea to shining sea who recognize the brilliance of the American idea wasn't in a fear of religion but in the vibrancy of faith. Faith to believe that God exists or that he doesn't, faith to pray before we legislate or anchor our pledge and our currency in subservience to a higher power. Faith to sing the song of freedom as the arc of history bends toward justice. Our children need not fear faith, especially in our sacred institutions of learning."""

After the Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night, Sen. Elizabeth Warren accused Sen. Bernie Sanders of calling her a liar during a tense exchange where she refused to shake his outstretched hand.
The rift was clear on video, but their mics weren't on at the time. Now CNN, which co-hosted the debate, has released a recording from the moment that marred the evening.
Sen. Warren says to Sen. Sanders, ""I think you called me a liar on national TV... I think you called me a liar on national TV.""
Sanders replies, ""Alright, let's not do it now.""
During the debate, Sanders denied Warren's claim that he told her a woman couldn't win the White House during a one-on-one meeting in 2018.
Their dispute after the debate was the latest development in the accelerating rift between the two top progressive candidates. It has many activists on the Left worried that it could split their voters and drive many of them toward Joe Biden.
During the debate, Sen. Warren said she thinks a female candidate would actually have the best shot at winning the 2020 presidential election. ""Look at the men on this stage, collectively they have lost 10 elections,"" she said. ""The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women.""
But after the debate between the top six Democrat candidates, some progressives expressed their fear that they're not sure if any of the potential candidates can beat President Trump. Liberal commentators Al Sharpton and Van Jones both came out said exactly that.
""There was nothing I saw tonight that would be able to take Donald Trump out,"" Jones said.
Jones continued his dire warning about the current candidates tweeting, ""I had high expectations for the candidates during tonight's #DemDebate, but there was a spark missing on stage. It felt like cold oatmeal to me. Do you agree?""

On Thursday, Trump accuser Rep. Adam Schiff read the articles of impeachment aloud on the floor of the US Senate. The Democrats' impeachment effort now moves into a trial phase where they will try to prosecute the president while President Trump will finally get the chance to defend himself and present his case.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has named the House prosecutors who will handle the Senate impeachment trial against Trump - all her top cohorts in the effort to remove the president. They include Democrats Adam Schiff of California and Jerrold Nadler of New York, who both led the House impeachment probe.

Impeachment Articles Expected to Move to Senate This Week; All Eyes on These 4 GOP Senators
President Trump has dismissed the impeachment effort during an event at the White House calling it a ""hoax"". Pelosi believes the impeachment vote by House Democrats on December 18th will stand because she claims there's even more evidence since then.
""Time has been our friend in all of this,"" Pelosi said. Over the weekend she gloated that no matter what happens next, President Trump has been ""impeached for life"" and it can never be undone.
Here Are the Charges
The impeachment charges against Trump include abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and it's all linked to claims he allegedly withheld funding from Ukraine to pressure them to investigate whether Joe Biden's son was given a job he wasn't qualified for as part of an Obama administration scheme. 
The newly appointed lead manager on impeachment, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff, said a fair trial demands the consideration of more evidence. That evidence could include newly released documents from an associate of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney.
What About Witnesses?
In regards to calling witnesses, Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun said: ""if we feel that we do not have enough information, I'm fine with it.""
Braun told CBN News that calling witnesses goes both ways, citing Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as a potential witness due to his son Hunter's role with Ukrainian gas company Burisma. ""How that can't be relevant to the discussion when there was corruption in Ukraine and are you immune from any kind of scrutiny because you're a potential political rival?"" asked Braun, in reference to former Vice President Biden. 
After months of closed-door meetings and public hearings, Republican senators see the trial on their side of the Hill as an opportunity to hear the rest of the story. ""There's a significant desire on our side for the President to be heard,"" said Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt.
During the mandatory trial, strict rules are in place on the Senate floor. Cell phones are prohibited and senators are restricted from talking amongst themselves. Senators on Capitol Hill have been told to prepare for six-hour sessions. 
President Trump's Reaction
The President wasted no time responding to Democrats Wednesday, taking to Twitter during Speaker Pelosi's announcement to call the trial ""another con job,"" exclaiming that ""all of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!""
Trump says the whole thing is a witch hunt and he was simply asking the Ukrainian president to make sure there wasn't corruption in the government's business before releasing US funding."

What many expected to be fiery, punch-filled evening turned out to be relatively tame, with all of the candidates seeming to put their best ""Midwest nice"" foot forward.
Elephant in the Room
One exception came when Elizabeth Warren addressed the elephant in the room: reports Bernie Sanders told her in 2018 that a woman couldn't win the election. 
""I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record,"" said the Massachusetts senator. ""Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women."" 
The socialist senator from Vermont defended himself by denying he ever made the comment. 
Iran and Iraq Foreign Policy Takes Center Stage
Amid growing tensions between the US and Iran, foreign policy dominated the evening.
Sanders hammered Joe Biden for his Iraq war vote. 
""I did everything I could to prevent that war,"" said Sanders. ""Joe saw it differently."" 
Biden responded by admitting what he now sees as a mistake. 
""I said, 13 years ago, it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war,"" said the former vice president. 
Other candidates took issue with President Trump's Iran policy. 
""We have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement,"" said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""As president, I will get us back into that agreement."" 
Billionaire Tom Steyer attacked Trump by saying he ""has no strategy."" 
Healthcare Disputes
On healthcare, Biden hit Sanders for not being ""candid with voters"" about the cost of his plan. ""I think we have to tell them what we're gonna do and what it's gonna cost,"" said Biden. 
And Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pushed back on Warren's claim that his plan is too small. 
""We've got to move past Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate,"" said Buttigieg. 
Attention-Grabbing Moment
Perhaps the moment getting the most attention happened after the debate when Sanders appeared to offer to shake Warren's hand and she possibly rejected it. The two then got into what appeared to be a serious conversation. 
The Iowa Caucus is now less than three weeks away and the latest Des Moines Register poll shows Sanders at the top of the race with Biden, Warren and Buttigieg all close behind. 
Trump Responds
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump went after the Democratic candidates last night saying they can't protect America or your family.
Speaking at a rally in Wisconsin, he blasted the Democratic Party for its reaction to the strike he ordered, taking out Iranian terrorist mastermind General Qasem Soleimani.
""The Democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster. You know, many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms or without legs and without... were done by Soleimani. That's what he loved. He loved the roadside bomb. That's what he loved. Thousands and thousands and thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan. Roadside bombs. He was the king of the roadside bombs.""
Trump also said his administration supports the Iranian people's struggle for freedom from the Islamic regime."

That's also when Speaker Nancy Pelosi will move to appoint the House managers in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.
It's been nearly a month since the House approved charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress involving foreign interference in the 2020 election. 
The President is looking for an outright dismissal, a move that seems unlikely even in the Republican-led Senate. 
While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fought to call more witnesses, he's keeping the door open by following rules of President Clinton's Impeachment proceeding.
""If the existing case is strong, there's no need for the judge and the jury to reopen the investigation,"" said McConnell, speaking Tuesday on the Senate floor. 
With stances like that from some Senate Republicans, the 51 votes needed for a motion to dismiss are unlikely. 
""Every Senate impeachment trial in history has included witnesses,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
""You want precedent?"" Schumer asked on the Senate floor Tuesday. ""Precedent says witnesses,"" he said.  
The big fish would be John Bolton, whose willingness to testify could lead the president to exert executive privilege to limit his former national security adviser as a witness. 
Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said the Senate will debate whether to call witnesses after the House managers make their case. 
""I feel very confident he'll be acquitted in the end,"" added Graham, in regards to the President. 
Before his own acquittal in 1999, when he told Americans in a Rose Garden address ""how profoundly sorry I am,"" President Clinton faced 13 impeachment managers during his Senate trial. 
""I believe that the impeachment managers set the tone,"" said Rep. Judy Chu, a Democrat from California. 
Met with cheers at Monday's college football championship in Louisiana, President Trump has said he doesn't feel like he's being impeached. 
Sen. Graham said to the President at the game, ""there's a process, once we start we're going to try to plow ahead and get it done, and hopefully by the time of the State of the Union.""
There are some procedural steps ahead of an impeachment trial in the Senate, including the swearing-in of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and all senators, and debate on a resolution on the trial guidelines. 
Leader McConnell said the third Senate trial of an American president could begin next Tuesday."

Cory Booker has become the latest to drop out of the race. He couldn't muster enough financial support or grab enough attention to bring up his meager poll numbers.
Only half of the 12 remaining candidates will be allowed to take the debate stage in Iowa at 9 p.m. Tuesday night. They needed to prove top-tier status to qualify, and that included 225,000 unique donors and higher poll numbers.
It's their final debate before the Iowa caucuses officially kick off the Democratic voting on February 3. Of the six candidates on the stage, four will be men and two will be women:
Former Vice President Joe Biden
Sen. Bernie Sanders (VT)
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (MA)
Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, IN
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (MN)
Billionaire Tom Steyer
Businessman Andrew Yang didn't make the stage due to low poll numbers, and billionaire Michael Bloomberg didn't qualify because he's mainly been funding his campaign with his own money and didn't have enough donors.
Meanwhile, polls show a tight and potentially shifting race for these 2020 presidential hopefuls. A new Monmouth poll shows Joe Biden in the lead once again with 24 percent of Iowa caucusgoers supporting him.
That poll shows Sanders with 18 percent support, Buttigieg with 17 percent, and Warren with 15 percent.
But a Des Moines Register poll shows socialist Sanders ahead in the state. Many Democratic insiders are growing concerned that Sanders could possibly win the party's nomination, and they worry that the socialist candidate would alienate the swing voters they need to help them beat President Trump in November.
The debate also comes amid a controversy about Sanders supposedly telling his fellow progressive Sen. Warren that he didn't believe a woman could win the election. He denies it, but she's confirmed it.

It is still not clear what day this week that will happen, but Pelosi will meet with her caucus Tuesday morning to discuss moving forward and is preparing the House for a vote early this week. 
The Senate will begin their trial almost immediately after receiving the articles. 
""There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure,"" Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said last week.
McConnell stood strong throughout the standoff with Pelosi, refusing her demands to promise witnesses in a Senate trial.
""The senators who are thinking now about voting for witnesses or not, they will have to be accountable for not having a fair trial,"" Pelosi told ABC's 'This Week'. 
While McConnell and other top Senate Republicans hope to end the trial quickly, they will take a vote on witnesses after the trial begins.
""Obviously, that is the most contentious part of one of these proceedings, and that'll be addressed at that time and not before the trial begins,"" McConnell told reporters.
According to a new Politico/Morning Consult poll, 57% of all voters would prefer witnesses called forward.   
""Whoever heard of a trial without witnesses and documents? it's unprecedented,"" asked Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
All eyes will be on GOP senators seen as vulnerable for reelection this year like Susan Collins, Martha McSally, Cory Gardner, and Thom Tillis. Schumer believes they might have a hard time voting with McConnell. 
""Many of his colleagues are very, very worried about going home and saying they are not for witnesses and documents,"" Schumer claims.
Speaker Pelosi says if the Senate doesn't have witnesses, the House could still call forth Ambassador John Bolton, who says he will testify in the Senate if subpoenaed. "

His departure now leaves a field that was once the most diverse in history with just one remaining African American candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.
 
Since launching his campaign last February, Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, struggled to raise the type of money required to support a White House bid. He was at the back of the pack in most surveys and failed to meet the polling requirements needed to participate in Tuesday's debate. Booker also missed last month's debate and exits the race polling in low single digits in the early primary states and nationwide.
 
In an email to supporters, Booker said that he “got into this race to win” and that his failure to make the debates prevented him from raising the money required for victory.
 
""Our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win -- money we don’t have, and money that is harder to raise because I won’t be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in Washington,"" he said.
 
Booker had warned that the looming impeachment trial of President Donald Trump would deal a “big, big blow” to his campaign by pulling him away from Iowa in the final weeks before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. He hinted at the challenges facing his campaign last week in an interview on The Associated Press' “Ground Game” podcast.
 
“If we can’t raise more money in this final stretch, we won’t be able to do the things that other campaigns with more money can do to show presence,"" he said.
 
In his email to supporters, Booker pledged to do “everything in my power to elect the eventual Democratic nominee for president,"" though his campaign says he has no immediate plans to endorse a candidate in the primary.
 
It’s a humbling finish for someone who was once lauded by Oprah Winfrey as the “rock star mayor” who helped lead the renewal of Newark, New Jersey. During his seven years in City Hall, Booker was known for his headline-grabbing feats of local do-goodery, including running into a burning building to save a woman, and his early fluency with social media, which brought him 1.4 million followers on Twitter when the platform was little used in politics. His rhetorical skills and Ivy League background often brought comparisons to President Barack Obama, and he'd been discussed as a potential presidential contender since his arrival in the Senate in 2013.
 
Now, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has mastered the art of the selfie on social media. Another former mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is seen as the freshest face in the field. And Booker’s message of hope and love seemed to fall flat during an era characterized perhaps most strongly by Democratic fury over the actions of the Trump administration.
 
An early focus on building out a strong and seasoned campaign operation in Iowa and South Carolina may have hampered his campaign in the long run, as the resources he spent early on staff there left him working with a tight budget in the later stages of the primary, when many of his opponents were going on air with television ads. That meant that even later in the campaign, after he had collected some of the top endorsements in Iowa and visited South Carolina almost more than any other candidate, a significant portion of the electorate in both states either said they were unfamiliar with his campaign or viewed him unfavorably.
 
On the stump, Booker emphasized his Midwestern connections - often referencing the nearly 80 family members he has still living in Iowa when he campaigned there - and delivered an exhortation to voters to use “radical love” to overcome what he considered Trump's hate. But he rarely drew a contrast with his opponents on the trail, even when asked directly, and even some of Booker's supporters worried his message on Trump wasn't sharp enough to go up against a Republican president known for dragging his opponents into the mud.
 
Booker struggled to land on a message that would resonate with voters. He's long been seen as a progressive Democrat in the Senate, pushing for criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. And on the campaign trail, he proposed establishing a $1,000 savings account for every child born in the U.S. to help close the racial wealth gap.
 
He was among the first candidates to release a gun control plan, and at the time it was the most ambitious in the field, as it included a gun licensing program that would have been seen as political suicide just a decade before. He also released an early criminal justice reform plan that focused heavily on addressing sentencing disparities for drug crimes.
 
But he also sought to frame himself as an uplifting, unifying figure who emphasized his bipartisan work record. That didn't land in a Democratic primary that has often rewarded candidates who promised voters they were tough-minded fighters who could take on Trump.
 
Booker's seat is up for a vote this year, and he will run for reelection to the Senate. A handful of candidates has launched campaigns for the seat, but Booker is expected to have an easy path to reelection.
   
Booker’s exit from the presidential race further narrows the once two dozen-strong field, which now stands at 12 candidates.

Now a new political firestorm will kick off in the Senate as Republicans seek to reject the House's impeachment vote. The first shots in this new round were fired Sunday as President Donald Trump and Speaker Pelosi squared off ahead over the upcoming Senate impeachment trial.
""The president is impeached for life, regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,"" Pelosi argued. ""There is nothing the Senate can do to ever erase that.""
On ABC's ""This Week"" she also declared, ""Let's be optimistic about the future, a future that will not have Donald Trump in the White House, one way or another. Ten months from now we will have an election if we will not have him removed sooner. But again, he will be impeached forever.""
House Republican Whip Steve Scalise blasted Pelosi's gleeful claims, tweeting, ""It's clear: Impeachment was a Democrat hit job to stain Trump's legacy and hurt him at the polls. Nothing more.""
Rep. Fred Keller also said Pelosi's comments reveal that her agenda ""has been only about one thing: impeaching a duly-elected President without facts and without evidence. Her quest to cancel 63 million votes and influence this year's election has been a total sham and a needless, divisive farce.""
Meanwhile, Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani says the Senate can clear the president's name by simply dismissing the charges. Trump agrees the case should be dismissed, but Pelosi says that would be a coverup.
Trump tweeted, ""Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!”
Pelosi is finally acquiescing to send the two articles of impeachment to the Senate after failing to get Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to go along with her demands. McConnell stood firm stating, ""There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure.""
Democratic senators had even begun pressuring Pelosi last week to send the articles to the Senate. That came after critics pointed out that House Democrats had argued they needed to urgently pass impeachment articles before Christmas but then held onto them for several weeks, refusing to deliver them to the Senate.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and others have already rejected the House impeachment effort, predicting the Senate trial would end ”in a matter of days″ with a fast acquittal.

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is preparing his Republican caucus for the trial, telling members to prepare for six-day work weeks and to stay in Washington next weekend.
McConnell claims the Senate will not make a decision whether to call witnesses until after phase one of the trial when they hear arguments from the prosecution and defense.
""Obviously, that is the most contentious part of one of these proceedings, and that'll be addressed at that time and not before the trial begin,"" McConnell told reporters this week.
McConnell and other top Senate Republicans hope to end the trial quickly without witnesses.
""I think our job is to pass judgment on the articles that they have sent over to us. That's the role that we have constitutionally in the Senate,"" said Sen. John Thune (R-SD), a member of GOP leadership. 
But GOP senators like Mitt Romney (R-UT) may prevent moving directly to a vote on the articles without hearing from witnesses first. 
""At this stage, I'd like to hear from John Bolton and other witnesses with the direct information,"" Romney told reporters.
McConnell will need 51 votes to call witnesses or move directly to a vote. Senate Democrats have made it very clear they want witnesses.
""The four witnesses we've asked to testify should testify,"" argued Sen. Michael Bennet, (D-CO).
""I have never seen a trial without a witness,"" claimed Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ).
+The mandatory Senate trial, however, spells trouble for the Democrat senators still in the presidential race that hope to campaign in early voting states ahead of the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3. "

In his Wednesday address, Trump called for new sanctions against the regime.
""We do not want to use (the military),"" said Trump. ""American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.""
On Capitol Hill Wednesday, it was a duel of words between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) over the president's decision to target Iran's General Qasem Soleimani and attempts to limit the president's ability to respond to future attacks from Iran.
""For our part, I certainly hope our own congressional delegations do not give Tehran a reason to question our national will,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor.
Schumer responded by criticizing Trump's leadership. ""I'm afraid that these impulsive and erratic actions, throughout the world, are making us less safe,"" he said.
Senators briefed by the administration's national security team came out of the meeting with mixed reaction.
""It was very well done,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) told reporters. ""I think they've done an excellent job of outlining the rationale behind both the decision to go after Soleimani and the response to the Iranian attack.""
Democrats though, and even some other Republicans, disagreed. ""It is a far cry from meeting a standard of imminent threat,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA).
Republican Sen. Mike Lee (UT) called it ""the worst briefing"" he'd seen on a military issue in his nine-year Senate tenure. He and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) both vowed to vote with Democrats to limit the president's war powers.
But Thursday morning, Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News that the intelligence was solid. ""The leadership in Congress in the House and Senate has seen this intelligence, and frankly the most compelling intelligence to support the fact that there was an imminent attack being developed by Qasem Soleimani was is freankly too sensitive to share broadly, it woud compromise what we call sources and methods.""
The Senate will vote next week.
Meanwhile, the House passed its resolution Thursday, making it clear that if the president wants to go to war, he must first get the approval of Congress.
Iran says their attack is the end of it, but analysts believe there are more on the way, including possible cyber attacks, and they've issued a warning to law enforcement agencies throughout the country."

While many top Republicans support the president, others questioned his authority to act without congressional approval. 
Both chambers of Congress had an opportunity this afternoon to question administration officials on reasons they felt Qasem Soleimani to be an imminent threat and the long term strategy in the region.
""I'm concerned they have no strategy,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, (D-NJ)

""He (Soleimani) is a nasty, nasty person and is a real threat to our national security,"" said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS)
Sen. James Lankford  (R-OK) argued after months of Iranian aggression toward the US - it was time to act. 
""The restraint that the President has had over and over again. That they take down one of our drones and then they launch rockets at us a dozen times over two months. And the President has not responded he has waited and said if an American is injured or killed we are going to respond in a very strong way,"" Lankford said. ""He's done that now and I think that's consistent with our policies.""
But Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) believes Trump should have cleared the attack with Congress.
""In our country, it was supposed to be that we wouldn't send people into harm's way unless there was a political consensus, represented by a congressional vote that war was in the national interest and that's what I'm trying to force Congress to grapple with,"" he said. 
Kaine introduced a war powers resolution to prevent President Trump from further escalating the situation with Iran without congressional approval.
""All he's doing is escalating tensions and he seems to believe 'I can strike you, but you can't strike me,'"" Kaine said. 
While Republicans like Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY) are considering to support Kaine's resolution or similar legislation, Lankford argues it is not needed because we are not at war with Iran or trying to start a war. "

","Let's get on with it! That's the attitude from President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who say they're ready for the impeachment trial. So, what are the Democrats waiting for?
McConnell announced Tuesday night he's ready to begin the trial without an agreement with Democrats over witnesses.
Democrats have been pushing for additional witnesses, but McConnell says he wants to defer that decision until later in the trial. That's similar to the process in President Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999.  
Now, McConnell has the votes to carry out that plan. The trial can't begin, though, until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sends the impeachment articles to the Senate.
McConnell said, ""Nearly three weeks after the rushed vote they claimed was so urgent, they are still debating whether or not they want to see the trial proceed."" He blasted Democrats for playing ""one cynical political game right on top of another.""
Pelosi reportedly told fellow Democrats Tuesday night that she's not ready to send the articles until she sees specific rules for trial procedures.
Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said Democrats aren't cooperating with Republicans to move the process forward. 
""Right now they seem to be intent on playing political games with this but if the House will send it over.  And Senator Schumer will agree to sit down with Senator McConnell, we can work out a path forward and we'll see where that leads,"" Thune said.

McConnell (R-KY) now has enough votes to stop Democrat demands to require additional witnesses to testify at the beginning of President Trump's impeachment trial, according to The Hill.
Two moderate GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are backing McConnell’s plan to defer a decision to call witnesses in the Senate trial.
This comes as Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton announced he will testify if called. Bolton issued a statement saying, ""If the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify.""
It takes a majority vote to call witnesses, and since the GOP has a 53 seat majority, McConnell has the upper hand in deciding whether to call Bolton and others.
""The House may have been content to scrap their own norms to hurt President Trump, but that is not the Senate,"" McConnell said.
He says the Senate should follow the precedent of the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial. That means waiting until later in the process to take up the question of calling additional witnesses.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says the Senate should agree now to call witnesses.
 
""If any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we've requested, they would make it absolutely clear they are participating in a cover-up,"" Schumer said.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still hasn't delivered the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
On Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News that the Republican-controlled Senate should change the rules to override Pelosi.
Graham said, ""Well, we're not going to let Nancy Pelosi use the rules of the Senate to her advantage. This is dangerous for the presidency as an institution.""

Wade,"More than 200 members of Congress have signed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the US Supreme Court to reconsider the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide.  
According to The New York Times, 39 senators and 166 House members - all Republicans except for two Democrats signed the brief to support a Louisiana law in a case called June Medical Services L.L.C. v. Gee.  In their brief, they also asked the justices to reconsider Roe and another landmark abortion ruling that followed it in 1992, Planned Parenthood v. Casey.  
The brief supports a law passed in Louisiana in 2014, but that has not taken effect due to legal challenges that have finally landed it before the high court.  The law states physicians performing abortions at clinics must have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, a requirement the law's supporters say is intended to help guarantee the competency of doctors, and to protect the health and safety of mothers seeking an abortion.
Opponents of the law say its real purpose is to limit access to abortion, which they say it severely does. The New York Times reports that only one abortion doctor in Louisiana has been able to meet the admitting privileges requirement. Democrat lawmakers in Congress have filed a brief in the case as well, opposing the Louisiana law.
The Louisiana law is the first dealing with abortion to come before the Supreme Court since Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both nominated by President Trump, were seated on the court. This amicus brief filed mostly by Republicans in Congress is the first to directly challenge the precedent of Roe v. Wade and other decisions that followed and based their conclusions on Roe. 
When Roe v. Wade was handed down by the Supreme Court in 1973 it was criticized as the epitome of judicial activism, with justices seen as ""legislating from the bench,"" and actively creating a national law that torpedoed abortion laws actually passed by legislatures across the country. The result has made abortion the most contentious social issue and political hot potato since the court ruled in the infamous Dred Scott decision that black people were never intended to be citizens of the United States, and supported laws saying they could not be counted as full persons. 
The brief, signed by 207 mostly Republican lawmakers, goes after Roe, saying that ""Forty-six years after Roe was decided, it remains a radically unsettled precedent,"" and noted the ""unworkability"" of the ""right to abortion"" found in Roe v. Wade and decisions based on it that followed.
But Katie Glenn, an attorney for Americans United For Life, the pro-life group that drafted the brief, told the Times she has no illusions that this Louisiana case will be the final blow to the much-disputed Roe.    
""No one is going into this case with an expectation that Roe v. Wade will be overturned,"" Glenn said. ""However, the court has the opportunity to reconsider the precedent that has gotten us to where we're at, and that's all that the members of Congress were seeking to point out, that it is the court's prerogative to assess the jurisprudence that got us here.""
That includes the reconsideration of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the right to abortion but said that states could restrict it as long as they didn't impose an ""undue burden"" on it.  Opponents of the Louisiana law will argue that it does hit that ""undue burden"" standard and that it should be overturned. A similar Texas law was struck down in 2016, based on that standard. 
But the amicus brief criticizes Casey's ""undue burden"" criteria as ""vague"" and ""opaque"" making it difficult for judges in Louisiana and elsewhere to know what it really means. 
The court will hear oral arguments in the Louisiana law case in March. A ruling is expected in June. 
However, the court rules, expect abortion to remain the hot button issue of our time that just won't go away. Namely, because it deals with the issue of life and death, and secondly, largely because of how the high court discovered a ""right to abortion"" in the first place. "

President Donald Trump hosted his kickoff rally of ""evangelicals for Trump"" in 2020 at the King Jesus International Ministry in Miami Friday afternoon.
Pastor Guillermo Maldonado welcomed the audience of more than 5,000 people to the event at the church he and his wife Ana founded. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council led the Pledge of Allegiance, which was followed by singer Danny Gokey performing the National Anthem. 
After a group prayer, the President was introduced to the audience by Paula White.
While the audience cheered, Trump stood behind the pulpit and warned terrorists not to challenge the United States.  
Referencing Thursday's attack against Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Trump said: “So let this be a warning to terrorists, if you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of American citizens.""
The President called the operation that killed Soleimani ""a flawless strike.""
“Qassem Soleimani has been killed and his bloody rampage is now, forever gone,"" Trump told the cheering audience. “He was plotting attacks on Americans, but we’ve now insured his atrocities have been stopped for good.""
The President also took a moment to remind Iran that the US does not want war. 
“We do not seek war,"" he said. ""We do not seek nation-building. We do not seek regime change.”
Touting the accomplishments made during his administration, Trump reminded the audience that faith and family need to be at the center of American life.
""For America to thrive in the 21st century, we must renew faith and family as the center of American life,"" he said. 
Trump also pointed to his efforts for religious liberty both in the US and around the world. “We’re defending religion itself. A society without religion cannot prosper. A nation without faith can not endure,” said Trump. “We can’t let one of our radical left friends come in here because everything we’ve done will be gone in short order.”
“The day I was sworn in, the federal government's war on religion came to an abrupt end,” Trump declared. He later added, “We can smile because we’re winning by so much.”
The President also condemned anti-Semitism, mentioning the recent attacks on Jews in New York. He also said that his administration would continue to stand up for Israel. 
Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, called Trump's campaign kickoff ""politically brilliant.""
""It is not only logical but—arguably—politically brilliant that the president will kick off 2020 with the launch of his reelection's evangelical outreach at a Latino megachurch in the state of Florida,"" he said. 
According to exit polls, 29 to 30 percent of Latinos voted for President Trump in 2016. 
""The driving forces behind that Hispanic support may this time garner even greater support: faith values and economic opportunity. Latino evangelicals represent a constituency that is pro-life, supportive of religious liberty, and focused on biblical justice,"" Rodriguez said.
He believes many Latino Christians are unlikely to support politicians who promote socialism, arguing that it was ""a socialistic worldview that destroyed Venezuela and Cuba and serves as the primary conduit for economic and civil rights oppression in Latin America.""
Not all evangelicals are in Trump's camp. Last month, a Christianity Today op-ed argued President Trump ""should be removed"" from office. The magazine got backlash from the evangelical publication's founder's son – Franklin Graham.
Trump received more than 80% of the evangelical support in 2016 and hopes to build on that number as he gets closer to 2020. A number of Christian leaders are weighing in on the event, saying many evangelical voters are still firmly supporting Trump.
Pastor Jack Graham of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Dallas, TX, said, ""As evangelicals, we are enthusiastically supportive of our President and his policies. The rally is an opportunity for us to recommit to the continuation of his presidency and the promise of America's best values.""
And Rev. Johnnie Moore tells CBN News, ""Every indication is that President Trump will ride an evangelical wave right back into the Oval Office in 2020, but this time the coalition will be even larger and even more diverse. He ran in 2016 as a promise maker but in 2020 he's running as a promise keeper; having not just met but exceeded the expectations of his constituents."" 
The Miami rally comes after the Trump campaign reported it raised $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, far ahead of any Democratic candidate.
A new Associated Press poll shows big support for President Trump among white evangelicals who are also distinct on abortion.
They spoke to 1,000 American adults from various faith backgrounds and found 67% of white evangelical protestants support making abortion illegal except in cases of rape, incest or threats to a mother's life. 
That's compared to 45% of Catholics and 37% of all Americans."

Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders is leading the Democratic field in fundraising, pulling in more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. That's the largest amount raised by any Democrat so far in this race.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg also had a strong quarter, raising almost $25 million. Buttigieg now has a campaign staff of 500 people nationwide.
And Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced she had raised $21.2 million in the final quarter.
But former Vice President Joe Biden remains the Democratic Party's front-runner in the polls.
While he came in third in the fundraising with $22.7 million, he still has 28 percent of support in the Real Clear Politics average of national polls. That puts him well ahead of Sanders at 19 percent, Warren at 15 percent, Buttigieg at eight, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg with just under five percent.
Meanwhile, Julian Castro has just dropped out of the race as the large Democratic field of candidates shrinks once again. Castro was Obama's Housing and Urban Development secretary and a former San Antonio mayor, but he struggled to gain enough support and donations.
On the Republican side, President Donald Trump's campaign has raised $46 million in its final quarter in 2019. That's the most of any 2020 candidate.
The president's campaign manager Brad Parscale is calling the campaign an ""unstoppable juggernaut"" in the midst of impeachment proceedings against the president.
""Democrats and the media have been in a sham impeachment frenzy and the president's campaign only got bigger and stronger with our best fundraising quarter this cycle,"" he said in a statement.
Parscale adds that the fourth-quarter numbers are only part of the story. He tweets, ""Biggest number in Trump fundraising haul is $102.7M cash-on-hand. Most ever by a re-election (campaign) at this point."""

NY, CA Losing Population, May Also Lose Congressional Seats","Even though the national economy is humming along nicely, the liberal states of New York and California are poised to lose congressional seats due to an ongoing exodus according to US Census Bureau population estimates released this week.
The Empire State and the Golden State are among 27 states and the District of Columbia which have lost residents due to domestic migration over the last two years.
New York was one of only 10 states to suffer a total population decline in 2018-19 — its fourth consecutive annual decrease after five years of growth, and the largest population drop of any state, the census data determined. 
""You'd think with a strong economy, New York wouldn't be losing population,"" the Empire Center's E.J. McMahon, author of the report, told The New York Post. 
New York's population has been stagnant over the past decade, with a modest 75,459 increase in residents since 2010, a growth rate of just 0.4 percent, ranking 46th-lowest out of 50 states, according to the newspaper. 
This stagnation will likely result in the loss of one or two congressional seats in the coming years. 
Staten Island Republican Councilman Joe Borelli said immigrants, as well as New York natives, are exiting or bypassing New York because it's become unaffordable.
""The cost of living in New York — the high taxes, regulations, and housing costs — are making it untenable to live the American dream here,"" Borelli told the newspaper, noting how many high school friends have moved out of New York.
All That Glitters Isn't Gold
Likewise, California's population growth has also continued to slow. So much in fact that for the first time in the state's history it may also lose a congressional seat.
The Los Angeles Times reported the state's economic woes are making it harder for people to make a living, so they're leaving.  
William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told the newspaper the Golden State's population migration could result in the loss of a seat in the US House of Representatives.  California currently has 53 seats in the House. 
""It's got a lot to do with dispersion from California to the rest of the west,"" Frey said. ""Arizona, Texas, and Colorado are all big destinations for California migrants, and they all are gaining seats.""
Texas may gain three seats after the 2020 decennial count, according to Frey's analysis of census data, while states such as Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon may gain one seat apiece.
The apportionment population count for each of the 50 states includes the state's total resident population — citizens and non-citizens — as well as a count of the overseas federal employees and their dependents who have that state listed as their home state in their employers' administrative records, according to the US Census Bureau."

The measure would have required houses of worship and other nonprofits to pay a 21 percent tax on employee benefits such as parking spaces and transit subsidies, according to the website CatholicPhilly.com.
The repeal was a part of appropriations bills for the new year, passed by both the House and Senate. The bill requiring the repeal was sponsored by Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. (D-NJ).  Since the bill is retroactive, the IRS will provide instructions on how churches can claim a refund on taxes they paid for the last two years because of the ""parking lot tax.""
Churches and evangelical leaders praised the government's action.
""This repeal comes as a welcome relief for millions of Americans, lifting this burden from nonprofits and houses of worship around the country,"" said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. ""Churches must never again be seen as untapped sources of government revenue.""
Moore also thanked House and Senate leaders, as well as other elected officials, who ""worked hard on this issue. And I'm glad to see the President formalize this repeal with his signature.""

Martin Luther King Jr., said in a statement that cancer was discovered this month during a routine medical visit. He said subsequent tests confirmed the diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic cancer.

The past century in American politics and religion has been littered with fitting examples. Great industrialists such as Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and others left “non-partisan” foundations to carry on their legacy. Though hardly liberals themselves, their fortunes now fund almost exclusively left-wing causes. Mainline protestant churches that were once known as “the Republican Party at prayer” have become some of the strongest voices pushing gay marriage and radical gender ideology.
Whenever possible, liberals exploit the leftward shift of those who run these organizations in order to weaponize the reputations those organizations have built up among conservatives. Articles purporting to present “the conservative case” or “the evangelical case” for policies that are almost universally reviled among conservatives appear to carry far more weight when they’re associated with a brand that has credibility on the right.
Christianity Today’s invocation of the great Billy Graham’s name to attack the President is merely the latest example of this well-worn strategy. It’s also one of the most transparently dishonest.
The Rev. Graham didn’t start Christianity Today as an explicitly right-wing institution. In fact, he didn’t start it to be a political rag of any variety, conservative or otherwise. His only objective was to promote the orthodox word of Christ. That was Billy Graham’s way. During the civil rights movement, he and my uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., didn’t necessarily see eye to eye on every political issue of the day, but they were able to preach together because they shared an abiding faith in the power of Christ and the indispensability of spreading the Gospel when it came to addressing the myriad injustices of the time.
Now, 53 years after the publication’s first issue and less than two years after Graham’s death, Christianity Today is being used to shill for political causes that run directly opposite to his own stated beliefs. Graham’s son, Franklin — himself a leading evangelical minister — responded immediately and forcefully to Christianity Today’s attempt to co-opt his father’s legacy on behalf of the Democratic Party’s political ends.
“My father knew Donald Trump, he believed in Donald Trump, and he voted for Donald Trump,” Franklin wrote in a scathing Facebook post. “For Christianity Today to side with the Democrat Party in a totally partisan attack on the President of the United States is unfathomable.”
Worse still, Christianity Today’s slide to the left is not just an affront to its founder, but also an abandonment of some of the key Christian doctrines it was created to uphold. In the First Epistle of Paul to Timothy, St. Paul urges the faithful to pray “For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.”
Whatever one’s politics, the usurpation of civil authority on grounds as flimsy and partisan as the articles of impeachment cooked up by Jerry Nadler and Nancy Pelosi runs counter to all principles of the Christian’s proper role in relation to politics. President Trump, far from being a “morally lost” leader in need of removal as the editorial argues, has returned Christian morality and respect for religious liberty to the very center of American political life.
In the spirit of Christian forgiveness, he has returned thousands of reformed offenders — the overwhelming majority of them African-American — to their families. In the spirit of Christian charity, he has fought to keep struggling Historically Black Colleges and Universities in operation by increasing federal assistance. And in the spirit of Christian faithfulness, he has protected the faithful everywhere from government intrusions that would force them to violate the core tenets of their religion.
There’s never been a more critical time for such a leader, given the rapid decline of civility and respect in our society. It’s a chilling indication of the times we live in that Netflix is marking the Christmas season by airing a disgusting, sacrilegious “comedy” special that depicts Jesus Christ as a homosexual.
As one who has experienced both happiness and sadness during past holiday seasons, though, I can offer my steadfast assurance that God’s love is always real. Every year, come what may, my family and I try to approach the season with love and forgiveness in our hearts. Some years are better than others, but the effort is always worth it.
Whatever your personal situation might be this Christmas, I encourage you to do your best to avoid the grinchy pitfalls and focus on what’s really important. If you can do that, I promise that it’s still possible to have a merry and blessed Christmas!

The latest face-off came one day after the historic vote in the House to impeach President Trump, a subject addressed right out of the gate.
""We've now seen the impact of corruption and that's what's clearly on the stage in 2020. Is how are we going to run against the most corrupt president in living history,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
""What conservatives, I think, understand is that we cannot have a President with that temperament who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) chimed in.
""My job is just to go out and make the case why he doesn't deserve to be president of the United States for another four years,"" explained Joe Biden.
With the timing of the PBS News Hour/Politico debate just weeks before the Iowa caucuses candidates appeared to distinguish themselves and diminish their opponents.
""The mayor just had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900 a bottle wine. Um, think about who comes to that,"" said Sen. Warren referring to Mayor Pete Buttigieg. ""Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president,"" she continued.
""According to Forbes Magazine, I'm literally the only person on this stage who's not a millionaire or a billionaire. This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass,"" Mayor Buttigieg fired back.
Biden went after Sander's plan to put all Americans on Medicare.
""Sixteen percent of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now. Tell me you're gonna add 84 percent more and there's not gonna be higher taxes. At least before he was honest about it. It's gonna increase personal taxes,"" Biden roared.
""That's right we are gonna increase personal taxes but we're eliminating premiums, we're eliminating co-payments, we're eliminating deductibles, we're eliminating all out of pocket expenses,"" Sanders responded.
Sanders, a Jew who lived in Israel as a child, called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""racist"" and criticized US policy towards the Jewish State.
""But what US foreign policy must be about is not just pro-Israel. We must be pro-Palestinian as well,"" Sanders said waving his hands as he spoke.
Midwesterners Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) painted themselves as sensible progressives. 
""I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time,"" Klobuchar explained.
Speaking in Singapore this week President Obama said the world would be a better place if more women were in charge and suggested many of the world's problems stem from ""old people, usually old men, not getting out of the way.""
Debate moderator and chief political correspondent for Politico Tim Alberta asked Biden, ""I'm going to guess that President Obama did not clear that comment through your campaign ahead of time.""
 
""And I'm gonna guess he wasn't talking about me either,"" Biden said with a smile to applause from the audience. ""Look, I'm running because I've been around...and with experience hopefully comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom.""
Amid new reporting critical of Obama's handling of the War in Afghanistan Biden firmly diverged from his former boss.
""I'm the guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan. period. We should not have done it,"" Biden said.
The former vice president remains the front runner. If elected he would be 82 years old at the end of his first term and was asked if he's committed to seeking a second term.
 
""No, I'm not willing to commit one way or another. Here's the deal - I'm not even elected one term yet and let's see where we are. Let's see what happens,"" he said to applause.
Candidates Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer were passionate about climate change. 
""We should obviously be paying to relocate Americans away from places that are hit by climate change,"" Yang said. ""Part of my plan is literally called 'move people to higher ground,'"" he explained.
""We actually have the technology that we need. It's called wind, and solar, and batteries,"" said Steyer.
And in this season of Christmas candidates were asked to either seek forgiveness or offer a gift.
""We have to bring people with us and now shut them out that is the gift we can give America in this election,"" Klobuchar said.
Democrats will debate four more times between now and the end of February.
All of the face-offs are located in early voting states.

By a 385-41 vote, the House approved a bill that puts in place terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
The legislation passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her colleagues won key concessions from an administration anxious to pass the trade deal before next year’s election season makes that task more difficult.
The deal is projected to have only a modest impact on the economy. But it gives lawmakers from both parties the chance to support an agreement sought by farmers, ranchers and business owners anxious to move past the months of trade tensions that have complicated spending and hiring decisions.
The GOP-controlled Senate probably will take up the legislation when members return to Washington after the holidays and after dealing with impeachment.
Trump made tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement a hallmark of his presidential run in 2016 as he tried to win over working-class voters in states such as Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.
“Critics said it couldn’t be done, but he made it happen. Another promise made, another promise kept,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
Some said the agreement did not do enough to prevent U.S. jobs from relocating to Mexico, but it won praise from Democrats who have routinely voted against prior trade agreements.
“Twenty-six years ago, I opposed NAFTA with every bone in my body,” said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. “I never thought the day would come when we would have the opportunity to right some of the wrongs in that agreement.”
Pelosi said the agreement was “light years” ahead of what the administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico. “We knew we could do better,” Pelosi said.
The original NAFTA phased out nearly all tariffs on goods produced and traded within North America. It was extraordinary because it linked two wealthy, developed countries with a poor, developing country. Since then, trade with Canada and Mexico has increased more rapidly than trade with most other countries.
Democrats for years have charged that NAFTA led to massive losses of high-paying manufacturing jobs in the U.S. as companies moved production to low-wage Mexico. Trump distinguished himself from free-trade Republicans in the presidential primary with his NAFTA-bashing rhetoric, and his administration got Canada and Mexico to negotiate a rewrite.
The International Trade Commission projected in April that the agreement would boost the economy by $68 billion and add 176,000 jobs six years after taking effect.
Some of the biggest impacts would be felt in the U.S. automotive industry. The agreement aims to see more cars produced where workers earn an average of at least $16 an hour.
The commission found that the new agreement would create 30,000 jobs in American auto parts plants. On the down side, the commission found the pact would increase the cost of pickup trucks and cars. That would hurt demand and reduce the number of jobs in factories that assemble cars by about 1,500.
Business and farm groups had been hitting the airwaves and the halls of Congress to get lawmakers to support the pact, putting pressure on Democrats to work with the administration even as labor unions remained wary that the new deal represented much of an improvement from NAFTA.
Trump, at times, seemed resigned to the assessment that the two sides would never reach a compromise. “She’s incapable of moving it,” Trump said a few weeks ago about Pelosi.
Behind the scenes, Trump’s lead negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, was working with House Democrats on changes to address their concerns. The agreement includes a process that could lead to inspections of factories and facilities in Mexico that are not living up to labor obligations.
It also secures more than $600 million for environmental problems in the NAFTA region. It scrapped giving pharmaceutical companies 10 years’ protection from cheaper competition in a category of ultra-expensive drugs called biologics, which are used to fight such illnesses as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes.
In the end, the AFL-CIO endorsed the pact, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other major business groups.
Some Republicans grumbled that Democrats took too long to get the agreement across the finish line, but many were quite happy with the result.
Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said the pact reminded him of when he would write a letter to Santa, and it would be answered with most of the presents he wanted on Christmas morning.
“This is certainly one of those times when the letter to Santa Claus actually got answered,” Kelly said.

0,2019-12-18T21:00:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/december/defiant-trump-rallies-supporters-as-house-impeaches-him,Defiant Trump Rallies Supporters as House Impeaches Him,"BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) - Defiant in the face of a historic rebuke, President Donald Trump rallied supporters in Michigan on Wednesday night as the House voted to impeach him, declaring, “It doesn't really feel like we're being impeached.”
Trump took the stage just minutes before he became the third president in U.S. history to be impeached by the House of Representatives.
In a dramatic and discordant split-screen, Trump emerged from a mock fireplace at the Christmas-themed rally as the debate in Washington was underway. He took time to praise “the miracle of Christmas, the greatness of America and the glory of God,” even as he slammed Democrats, accusing the “radical left in Congress"" of being “consumed with envy and hate and rage.""
Aides had said Trump would wait to see the House vote before coming out to address the rally, but he appeared on stage early and promised “the best speech you've ever heard"" in a swing state that narrowly voted for him in 2016.
While Trump and his aides have tried to brush off the significance of the vote - noting there is little chance he will be convicted by the Republican-controlled Senate and removed from office - allies nonetheless acknowledged that Trump has been angry over the stain that impeachment will leave on his legacy.
Throughout the day, Trump stared down the impending vote as he has every obstacle in his presidency: by broadcasting his grievances via tweet.
While the White House insisted Trump would be busy working rather than focused on the proceedings in the House, he spent much of his day tweeting and retweeting, expressing fury and disbelief. 
“Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, AND I DID NOTHING WRONG!"" Trump wrote in one of 45 tweets posted before noon. He asked his followers to “Say a PRAYER!""
As members of the House debated the articles of impeachment, Trump's urgency appeared to escalate as he switched to all capital letters: “SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!"" he wrote.
The House considered two articles of impeachment. The first charges him with abuse of power for allegedly pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals while crucial U.S. security aid was being withheld. The second charges him with obstruction of Congress for stonewalling investigative efforts.
As the debate wore on, Trump aides, including White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, fanned out across Capitol Hill to bolster the president's message that impeachment is helping Republicans and damaging Democrats. Vice President Mike Pence got to Michigan ahead of Trump for a daylong bus tour before the Battle Creek rally. 
Serving as a warm-up act for Trump at the rally, Pence labeled the impeachment drive “a disgrace” and told the crowd that Democrats were “trying to impeach this president because they know they can’t defeat this president.""
He said Pelosi and the Democrats are “having their say tonight, but the Republican Senate is going to have their say in January.”
The president's middle son, Eric, told reporters during a campaign conference call that he and other Trump surrogates would be working to target Democrats in districts his father won in 2016.
“We’re going to win this thing again. They are handing it to us,"" he said. “But this is very sad that they are putting the country through this.""
Conway said recent polling and the influx of money suggest “this entire exercise has blown up in the Democrats' face."" Polls indicate the public is divided over whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, though opinions have generally remained steady.
Trump's campaign has experienced a surge in contributions and volunteers during the proceedings and was hoping to raise an additional $2 million Wednesday ahead of the votes. 
Trump, for his part, had plenty to say via tweet, declaring that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “Will go down in history as worst Speaker."" He also generously retweeted allies' comments from his favorite morning show, “Fox & Friends,"" as the hosts sought to reassure conservative voters that Trump remains in good spirits despite the looming vote.
Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, and Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said they were among a group of GOP lawmakers who met with Trump at the White House on Tuesday evening to talk strategy about Wednesday’s House session and the likely Senate trial in January.
McCarthy insisted that Trump remains focused on moving forward with his agenda, despite the implications for his legacy.
“Anybody else, this would be traumatic for them,” McCarthy said. “I've never seen a man so strong. ... He is focused on what the American people need.”
It was a message repeated by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who insisted on “Fox & Friends"" that the president has been a voice of calm for top administration officials, despite his public fury.
“He is such a focused president,"" Grisham said. ""I must tell you that while he's frustrated ... he is also so focused, and he is leading our White House and keeping us calm and telling us, 'That's OK, we're going to move forward, we're focused, this is going to take us through to 2020.'”

Democratic Lawmaker Jeff Van Drew Plans to Switch Parties Over Impeachment
Trump criticized the vote moments after the articles were approved as he addressed supporters at a rally in Battle Creek, Mich.
“They’re the ones that should be impeached,” Trump said of Democrat lawmakers. “House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans,” he said.
The focus now shifts to the Senate where a trial will be held in January. The Senate needs a two-thirds majority vote for the impeachment articles to pass and two remove Trump from office. Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate, are expected to acquit the President. 
As CBN News reported, Senate leaders have already begun battling over the trial.  
Majority leader Mitch McConnell rejected Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) demand that he call witnesses, including Acting White House Chief of Staff. Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Advisor John Bolton. 
McConnell says it's not the Senate's job to prove the House's case. 
""If House Democrats' case is this deficient, this thin, the answer is not for the judge and jury to cure it here in the Senate,"" he said. 
 Just after the House voted White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham released the following statement:
""Today marks the culmination in the House of one of the most shameful political episodes in the history of our Nation.  Without receiving a single Republican vote, and without providing any proof of wrongdoing, Democrats pushed illegitimate articles of impeachment against the President through the House of Representatives.  Democrats have chosen to proceed on this partisan basis in spite of the fact that the President did absolutely nothing wrong.  Indeed, weeks of hearings have proved that he did nothing wrong.  
Throughout the House Democrats' entire sham impeachment, the President was denied fundamental fairness and due process under the law.  The House blatantly ignored precedent and conducted the inquiry in secrecy behind closed doors so that Chairman Adam Schiff and his partisan political cronies could selectively leak information to their partners in the media to push a false narrative. 
When public hearings were held before Chairman Schiff's committee, Democrats continued their games and denied the President the ability to cross-examine witnesses or present witnesses or evidence.  The proceedings in the Judiciary Committee included no fact witnesses at all and consisted solely of a biased law seminar and a staffer rehashing the slanted report that was produced by Chairman Schiff's rigged proceeding.  This unconstitutional travesty resulted in two baseless articles of impeachment that lack any support in evidence and fail even to describe any impeachable offense. 
All of these antics make clear that Democrats have lost sight of what this country needs, which is a Congress that works for the people.  Their boundless animus for President Trump fuels their desire to nullify the 2016 election results, and improperly influence the 2020 election.
The American people are not fooled by this disgraceful behavior.  They understand fairness, due process, and substantial, reliable evidence are required before any American should be charged with wrongdoing—and certainly before impeaching a duly elected President. 
The President is confident the Senate will restore regular order, fairness, and due process, all of which were ignored in the House proceedings.  He is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated.  President Trump will continue to work tirelessly to address the needs and priorities of the American people, as he has since the day he took office."""

COMPLETE IMPEACHMENT COVERAGE, CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE
Rep. Barry Loudermilk ended up trending on social media after his comments, in which he compared what Trump is going through to that of what Jesus went through, being accused of crimes he did not commit.
“When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers. During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president in this process,” Rep. Loudermilk said.
Reaction on social media was swift — and mostly critical:
Given we’re just days away from Christmas, the timing of such a comparison is especially sensitive. While Rep. Loudermilk may not have been specifically comparing Trump to Jesus but rather making a larger point about an unjust trial, the timing was clearly not all that well thought out.
Jesus was put to death in a gruesome fashion, having been beaten, tortured then nailed to a cross. Anytime the sacrifice of our Savior is mentioned to make a political point, it should fall somewhat flat because there simply is no comparison to what Christ accomplished on the cross versus anything happening today.
Regardless of how one feels about the merits (or lack thereof) of the impeachment hearings and vote happening today, there was no bigger injustice than Jesus’ murder.
But thankfully, Jesus conquered the grave and is sovereign over all. Rulers rise and fall under His direction, so we can rest assured that whatever the outcome of the impeachment hearing, Jesus is still in control."

'We Don't Need to Clean Up Their Sloppy Job': Senate GOP Rejects Dem Impeachment Demands
Impeachment Battle Already Moving to Senate Where Republicans Are Pushing Back
Democratic Lawmaker Jeff Van Drew Plans to Switch Parties Over Impeachment
In a six-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, the President slammed the move by Democrats calling it an ""illegal, partisan attempted coup.""
He also accused Pelosi of ""declaring open war on American democracy.""
Trump also wrote, ""More due process was afforded those accused in the Salem Witch Trials."" 
Pelosi replied that she's too busy to read the whole letter. 
""I haven't really fully read it,"" she said. ""We've been working. I've seen the essence of it though, and it's really sick.""
Meanwhile, Senate leaders are battling over the coming trial. 
Majority leader Mitch McConnell rejected Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) demand that he call witnesses, including Acting White House Chief of Staff. Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Advisor John Bolton. 
McConnell says it's not the Senate's job to prove the House's case. 
""If House Democrats' case is this deficient, this thin, the answer is not for the judge and jury to cure it here in the Senate,"" he said. 
On Tuesday night from New York City's Times Square to small towns across the country, impeachment supporters and opponents holding rallies. 
The two impeachment articles will be presented to the full House against the President on Wednesday -- Obstructing Congress and abusing the power of his office for personal gain. Democrats say he pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.
After a procedural vote, the House will spend 6 hours debating the two articles and then will hold the vote. 
The articles are likely to be approved as most Democrats, including those at risk of losing their seats say they will vote to impeach.  No Republicans support impeachment. 
Meanwhile, the latest polls by Real Clear Politics shows that Americans are split over impeachment with 46.9 percent in favor of impeaching and removing the President from office while 47.6 percent oppose it. "

A copy of the letter was posted online by the news website Politico.
""This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers,"" the President wrote, ""unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history."" 
In the letter, Trump tells the House Speaker that he has been deprived of ""basic Constitution Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present.""
""More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials,"" the President wrote.
Trump also reminded Pelosi the effect of his impeachment will not only echo throughout US history but will also be felt by Democrats in next year's election. 
Trump called the impeachment ""nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth.""
""Because of this colossal injustice, our party is more united than it has ever been before,"" he noted. 
Trump also called out Pelosi on her alleged knowledge that former Vice President Joe Biden used his office and $1 billion of US aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor who was investigating Biden's son.
""You know this,"" the President wrote, ""because Biden bragged about it on video. Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it 'looked bad.'  Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden admitted he actually did.""
Trump also pointed to Ukraine's president's response when asked about the July 25 telephone call. 
""President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong,"" he wrote, ""and there was No Pressure.""
The President also points out that this impeachment effort was three years in the making. 
""Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306 - 227) and your party has never recovered from this defeat,"" he wrote. 
Trump concluded the letter to Pelosi writing ""there is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens. It is time for you and the highly partisan Democrats in Congress to immediately cease this impeachment fantasy and get back to work for the American People.  While I have no expectation that you will do so, I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record.""
""One hundred years from now,"" the President wrote, ""when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it, and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another President again.""

While Trump could be acquitted in the inevitable Senate trial next year, the battle is about how that process should play out. Senate Republicans are deliberating whether or not to call witnesses when impeachment moves to the upper chamber.
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has announced that he opposes the witness demands being made by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY).  ""It is not the Senate's job to leap into the breach and search desperately for ways to get to 'guilty',"" Politico reports McConnell saying as he's essentially blaming the House for failing to prosecute the case properly.
 
""I'm not trying to hide the fact that I have disdain for the accusations and the process. So I don't need any witnesses,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).
 
Many Republican senators argue they've already heard enough to push for a short Senate trial with no witnesses, but add they will take their cue from the White House.
 
""To me, if he would want witnesses called, I think that that delays it. There might be some pitfalls associated with it because I'm guessing we'd probably have to let their witnesses in as well, if they don't give us any new information what's the point?"" Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told CBN News. ""I think largely though the Senate ought to be listening to what the president wants to do through his team to finally litigate the defense.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer definitely announced the four witnesses Democrats would like to call forward earlier this week: Mick Mulvaney, Robert Blair, John Bolton, and Michael Duffey – witnesses the White House blocked from testifying in the House hearings.
 
""I don't know what they'll say, maybe they'll be exculpatory to President Trump but to not have them is to engage in a cover-up, it is to say we're afraid,"" explained Sen. Schumer on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kOPIVbyl3c
 
Sen. Schumer believes hearing from these witnesses will make the House case even stronger.
 
""We want the facts,"" continued Schumer. ""The four witnesses we've asked for, the documents we've asked for are directly dispositive on what the actual facts were. The House came up with a whole lot, but there's some of my Republican colleagues who say, 'look these charges are serious but I'm not sure there's enough evidence.' That's why these people should come.""
But Senate Republicans have rejected that idea, saying the House should have taken the time to go to court to force those witnesses to testify if they really thought their testimony was essential.
“We don't need to clean up their sloppy job,” said Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst.
“The House can't decide not to go to court, send us a half-baked case and then say now, ‘You make something out of it,’” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
 
Fifty-one votes are required to either call witnesses in a longer trial or directly move to a vote on the two articles of impeachment. If Republicans decide to call witnesses, which the president reportedly favors, that could open the door for calling Hunter Biden to testify.
 
Ahead of the House vote Wednesday - the pressure is so high New Jersey Democrat Jeff Van Drew, who already plans to vote ""no"" on impeachment, is reportedly preparing to switch to the Republican Party - news that triggered a mass resignation amongst his Capitol Hill staff.

But the fight is already moving to the Senate where leaders are working to set up a 2020 impeachment trial to put a final end to the controversial undertaking.
The top Democrat there, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY), wants to see several current and former Trump administration officials subpoenaed to testify in the Senate trial.
Schumer specifically wants to hear from White House officials who refused to participate in the House investigation - like current Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Mulvaney adviser Robert Blair, and former National Security Adviser John Bolton who may have left on bad terms with the president.

Democratic Lawmaker Jeff Van Drew Plans to Switch Parties Over Impeachment
It's not likely Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will comply with those demands since he has also reportedly pushed back on President Trump's desire to call witnesses like Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who orchestrated the Democrats' impeachment effort in the House, and former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden.
Schiff, who has been accused of rigging the impeachment proceedings and prejudging the outcome, said, ""I hope that the senators will insist on getting the documents, on hearing from the witnesses, on making up their own mind.""
McConnell and other GOP Senate leaders maintain that this impeachment effort is baseless.
And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) finds comments like Schiff's to be insincere. ""I am - clearly made up my mind. I'm not trying to hide the fact that I have disdain for the accusations and the process. So I don't need any witnesses,"" he said.
One House Democrat who opposes impeachment might switch parties in protest over the whole process. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey is rumored to be considering joining the Republican Party.
Meanwhile, two new polls show the American people are still divided. A Fox News poll shows 50 percent of Americans support impeaching and removing the president, while a USA Today poll shows 51 percent oppose a Senate vote removing him from office.
A House vote on the articles of impeachment could come as soon as Wednesday.

Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who has long opposed House Democrats’ impeachment effort, discussed switching parties in a meeting with President Donald Trump, an administration official said Saturday.
The official, who was not authorized to discuss the private conversation and spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Van Drew met with Trump in the White House on Friday.
Drew, a longtime state senator serving his first term in Congress, is one of his party's more endangered lawmakers in next November's elections. His southern New Jersey district narrowly favored Trump in 2016 and the congressional seat he won in 2018 had been under Republican control for nearly two decades.
The House is set to approve two articles of impeachment against Trump this coming week. Democrats, who hold the majority, expect support from all but a few of their members. No Republicans are expected to join them. 
The Republican-controlled Senate is then all but certain to acquit Trump after a trial in January. 
Van Drew has argued that the process is likely just to further divide the country and it would be better to let voters decide Trump's fate in next year's election. 
In the first article of impeachment, Trump is accused of abusing his presidential power by asking Ukraine to investigate his 2020 rival Joe Biden while holding military aid as leverage. In the second article, he's accused of obstructing Congress by blocking the House's efforts to investigate his actions.

The justices are poised to issue decisions in June, amid Trump's bid for a second term. Rulings against the president could result in the quick release of personal financial information that Trump has sought strenuously to keep private. The court also will decide whether the Manhattan district attorney can obtain eight years of Trump's tax returns as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.
Arguments will take place in late March. The subpoenas are separate from the ongoing impeachment proceedings against Trump, headed for a vote in the full House next week. Indeed, it's almost certain the court won't hear the cases until after a Senate trial over whether to remove Trump has ended.
Trump sued to prevent banks and accounting firms from complying with subpoenas for his records from three committees of the House of Representatives and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.
In three separate cases, he has so far lost at every step, but the records have not been turned over pending a final court ruling. Now it will be up to a court that includes two Trump appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to decide.

In fact, he's being charged with obstruction of Congress which is a lesser charge.
WASHINGTON – Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee passed two articles of impeachment against President Trump Friday morning, accusing the president of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The impeachment case now heads to the full House of Representatives where Democrats have vowed to officially impeach Trump before Christmas.
However, after months of investigations and weeks of debate, it seems the number of people who either support or oppose the Democrats' push to impeach hasn't changed.
Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) abruptly postponed a committee vote late Thursday night that would have sent the articles to the full House of Representatives. That surprise move came after some 14 hours of often bitter partisan debate.
""We have an ongoing crime. We have a crime in progress,"" Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA) told the committee.
But staunch Trump defender Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said, ""It's not just an attack on the presidency. It's an attack on us. It's an attack on those of us who believe in this president."" 
""This is a constitutional crime spree, that's why our courage is do badly needed right here, right now. Our national security and our democracy are depending on it,"" said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA).
 
Although earlier this year Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said impeachment should be bipartisan, it appears that opposition to impeachment is what will have bipartisan support with some House Democrats abandoning their own party.
""The impeachment is going to fail and the Democrats will pay a heavy political price for it,"" predicted Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA).
A number of Democrats serving in swing districts fear a vote for impeachment could cost them their seat.
""I made a commitment to my district from the moment that this began that I'm going to focus on all the facts,"" explained Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) who serves in a swing district.
Senior Democratic aides tell the Washington Post the number of Democrats defecting could range from two to possibly six or more.
When asked about those moderate Democrats forced to take a tough vote, Speaker Pelosi said, ""People have to form to their own conclusions.""
Even with defections, the House is all but certain to impeach the president after which the Senate is expected to move quickly through its trial in the new year. And despite the president's call to subpoena high profile witnesses like Joe and Hunter Biden, Senate Republicans may not call any witnesses.
""There's zero chance obviously the president is going to be removed from office,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said during an interview on Fox News Channel.
And that appears to be the way Americans want it. According to a new Monmouth University Poll, voters still oppose impeachment by a slim majority 50 to 45 percent. Americans in swing states oppose it even more, and independent voters are strongly against impeachment from anywhere from eight to 19 points.
Despite their efforts, this hasn't been the homerun Democrats hoped for.

0,2019-12-13T03:15:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/december/senate-backs-measure-affirming-century-old-armenian-genocide,Senate Backs Measure Affirming Century-Old Armenian Genocide,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Mass killings of more than a million Armenians by Ottoman Turks a century ago were genocide, the Senate declared Thursday in a vote that prompted angry denunciations by Turkey and accusations that the U.S. was undermining its relations with a key NATO ally.
The Senate action follows a vote by a Senate committee to impose sanctions on Turkey after its offensive in Syria and purchase of a Russian S-400 missile system.
The actions were the latest by Congress to push President Donald Trump to take a harder line against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump said last month that Erdogan was “doing a fantastic job for the people of Turkey.″
The Armenian resolution and the sanction bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee “endanger the future of our bilateral relations,” said Fahrettin Altun, a spokesman for Erdogan.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Senate vote “is a shameful example of the politicization of history. However, those who use history for political purposes will never achieve their goals.″
The Armenian resolution had been blocked three times at the request of the White House, but won unanimous approval Thursday on its fourth try.
Co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the nonbinding resolution affirms that the genocide occurred and that Turkey is responsible.
“I say to my friends and colleagues that genocide is genocide,″ Menendez said on the Senate floor. “Senators in this body should have the simple courage to say it plainly, say it clearly and say it without reservation.″
Menendez and Cruz tried three times to bring up the resolution using a procedural maneuver that would allow approval on a voice vote, a way to avoid lengthy floor debate. Each time, a Republican senator objected, citing White House disapproval.
Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who objected to the measure last week, said he agreed to do so at the White House’s request because the vote would have occurred around the time of a NATO summit where Trump, Erdogan and other leaders gathered in London.
The House passed an identical resolution overwhelmingly in October in what was widely seen as a rebuke to Turkey after its invasion of northern Syria. Turkey has lobbied for years against U.S. recognition of the killings of Ottoman Armenians as genocide. Erdogan said during a White House visit last month that the House vote had “hurt deeply the Turkish nation” and had “a potential of casting a deep shadow over our bilateral relations.″
Activist groups cheered the Senate vote as long overdue. “The president ran out of people he could turn to to enforce Erdogan’s veto,″ said Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America.
Turkey’s decadeslong opposition to the resolution was “the longest-lasting veto over U.S. foreign policy” by a foreign power in American history, Hamparian said.
Historians estimate that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed around World War I, and many scholars see it as the 20th century’s first genocide. Turkey disputes the description, saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of a civil war.
Instead of a resolution affirming the genocide, Turkey has called for a joint committee of historians to investigate the slayings.
Senate supporters got a big boost Thursday when reality TV star Kim Kardashian West took to social media to urge approval. “Please call your Senators NOW and urge them to vote YES on the #ArmenianGenocide resolution,″ she told her 153 million followers on Instagram. “Denial is the final stage of genocide,″ she added.
Kardashian West, who is of Armenian descent, also tweeted in support of the resolution.
Cruz called the vote a “moral duty,″ noting that a century ago, “the world remained silent” about the genocide, which even now is not widely known. The United States has an obligation to acknowledge the murder of “1.5 million innocent souls,″ Cruz said. “This is a moment of truth that was far too long coming.″
Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said the sanctions bill is intended to force Erdogan to “walk away from the S-400” missiles.
“As long as the S-400s are in Turkey under Turkish control, there will be no F-35s delivered to Turkey,″ Risch said, referring to a U.S.-led fighter jet program. “This is Erdogan’s choice, and he is well aware of the consequences.″
Republicans and Democrats in Congress are angry about Turkey’s S-400 purchase, which they see as a threat to NATO defenses.

A call by Republicans to strike the first article -- the abuse of power tipped off Thursday's spirited debate.

Republicans were fired up not only because they say the proposed articles of impeachment are baseless, but also because they say Democrats are running roughshod with this process.
""This is a travesty and a sham from day one. I could talk until I'm blue in the face but nobody on the majority cares,"" said Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) ""Facts be damned. They don't care.""
""Let us stay true to the facts and let's dispense of these process arguments and get to substance of why we're here today,"" reminded Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO)
Republicans call article one, the abuse of power assertion, weak and frivolous.
""Article one ignores the truth. It ignores the facts. It ignores what has been laid out to the American people over the last three weeks,"" noted Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio)
 ""It is not frivolous and without facts that we proceed...we proceed with facts,"" said Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee (D-Texas)
And Democrats say the fact is the President tried to withhold aid to Ukraine to muscle its president into opening an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden's son, who was on the board of directors for the Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings.
But Republicans say four facts refute that. One, there was no evidence of pressure during the infamous July 25 phone call between President Trump and Zelensky.  Two, they say there was no evidence of conditionality or quid pro quo.  Three, Ukraine never opened an investigation yet still received the aid. And four, Ukraine was not aware of aid being withheld.
""While the President claimed that there was no quid pro quo he made it clear that President Zelensky must publicly announce the two investigations that President Trump discussed on July 25 in the call in order for the security assistance to be lifted,"" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI). ""That's direct evidence."""

Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz detailed a failure in the FBI chain of command while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Horowitz carefully tried to have his testimony only reflect what is contained in the 400-page report about the Russia investigation dubbed ""Operation Crossfire Hurricane"".  
But he could not deny charges about FBI methods that some are calling sloppy at best, criminal at worst.
The IG's report, released Monday, essentially found just cause to initiate the Russia investigation, something Horowitz reiterated at the very beginning of his testimony. ""We found that Operation Crossfire Hurricane was opened for an authorized investigative purpose and with sufficient factual predication,"" Horowitz said.
But he quickly followed that statement with acknowledgement that investigators did not follow proper rules and procedures along the way. This included omitting or changing information on FISA applications that would allow surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page - information like the fact that the infamous Steele dossier, which was a big consideration in approving the applications, had been funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign.  Horowitz said the FISA court approved the surveillance applications multiple times based on incomplete information even though investigators knew better.
""The circumstances reflect a failure, as we outline in the report, not just by those who prepared the applications but also by the managers and supervisors in the Crossfire Hurricane chain of command including FBI senior officials who were briefed as the investigation progressed,"" Horowitz said.
The Inspector General went on to explain an overall lack of oversight within the FBI.
""Where time and again during our OIG interviews FBI managers, supervisors and senior officials displayed a lack of understanding or awareness of important information concerning many of the problems we identified,"" Horowitz said. ""It's pretty bad.""
Still, Horowitz underscored finding no political bias during his investigation, a claim Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) rebuffed.
""What has been described as a few irregularities becomes a massive criminal conspiracy over time to defraud the FISA court, to illegally surveil an American citizen and to keep an investigation open against a sitting president of the United States,"" Graham said.
Graham read aloud several text messages by some of those at the highest levels of Operation Crossfire Hurricane.
Graham quoted one message that said: ""I'm all riled up, Trump is an f-ing idiot who can't provide coherent answer.""
Another stated: ""Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart, I could smell the Trump support.""
Horowitz maintained those messages did not indicate the investigation was authorized improperly. Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) echoed that.
""I believe strongly that it's time to move on from the false claims of political bias,"" Feinstein said. ""And those who show great interest in politically motivated investigations against President Trump should show the same concern about politically motivated investigations requested by the President or his Attorney General.""
Attorney General Bill Barr has been very outspoken about his disagreement with Horowitz that the investigation was opened for proper reasons.  US Attorney John Durham has been as well.  Durham is still conducting a criminal investigation on the matter whereas the IG's report only recommends internal disciplinary action against several of those involved in making sure the Russia probe got off the ground."

Trump's latest executive order targets discrimination, specifically the growing problem of anti-Semitism on college campuses.
It's reported this order also changes the definition of Judaism to include nationality. That means certain anti-Israel movements would be considered a form of anti-Semitism. 
""Sadly BDS has also made disturbing headway on American college campuses,"" Trump said.

Schools not addressing anti-Israel movements could lose federal funding under the Civil Rights Act of 1963.
This past weekend at the Israeli American Council National Summit, President Trump invited NYU grad Adela Cojab to talk about a complaint she filed before graduating. 
""My university failed to protect its Jewish community from ongoing harassment, from attacks on social media to resolutions on student government, to boycotts, flag burning, and physical assaults,"" Cojab said. 
Trump also called out anti-Semitism among lawmakers in the nation's capital.
""You have to be very careful, make no mistake, radical lawmakers who support the BDS movement are advancing anti-Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda and Americans won't stand for it,"" Trump said. 
Trump's new order follows Tuesday's shooting in New Jersey that left 6 people dead in a targeted attack on a Jewish deli.
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop tweeted ""I'm Jewish and proud to live in a community like #jersey city.. hate and Anti-Semitism have never had a place here in jc and will never have a place in our city.""

Senate Chaplain in Awe of Senator Who's Led 13 Heads of State to Christ
""Let us pray. Eternal Father, the center of our joy. Bless our lawmakers with the peace and wisdom needed to lead in our challenging world. Give them eyes to discern and understand the intricate complexity of this turbulent season. Lord, guide our senators to the right paths, lead them beside still waters, restore their souls.""
""Let them lack nothing, for You can keep them whole. Overflow their cups with gentleness, care and understanding for the people they represent. Let them fear no evil and take courage in adversity for You continue to lead them with Your all-knowing right hand. We pray in Your everlasting name, Amen.""
Some Americans are concerned there's an ongoing effort by atheists to remove prayer from the nation's halls of power, that God is no longer welcome in these halls. But Black says to take heart.  
""There are many, many lawmakers who are modeling civility,"" Black said. ""The challenge is that the legislative process by its very nature is adversarial.""
The importance of having prayer in Congress was on display in a powerful way this past summer, as well, when House Chaplain Rev. Patrick Conroy offered a powerful prayer for ""spirits of darkness"" to be removed from the chamber.
""In Your most holy name, I now cast out all spirits of darkness from this chamber, spirits not from You. I cast out the spirit of discouragement which deadens the hope of those who are of goodwill. I cast out the spirit of petty divisiveness, which clouds the sense and desires to be of fruitful productivity in addressing the issues more appropriately before this House.""
""I cast out any sadness brought on by the frustration of dealing with matters detrimental to the honorable work each member has been called to engage in,"" Conroy added.
The duties of the Senate Chaplain include opening the Senate each day in prayer, counseling and spiritual care for the senators, their families and their staffs - which is a combined constituency of 6,000 people. 
Chaplain Black's days involve meeting with senators about spiritual and moral issues and assisting the senators' staff with research on theological and biblical questions. 
 
Also, he teaches Senate Bible study groups where there is a reflection and discussion time among the attending senators and staff.
The role of the chaplain as a spiritual advisor and counselor has changed over the years. It began as a part-time position into a full-time career as one of the officers of the Senate. 
Black reminds citizens of the power in praying for wisdom for all our leaders.
""What many Americans may not realize, not only is prayer alive and well, there are hundreds of intercessors on Capitol Hill,"" Black told CBN News a few years ago.
""I get folks dropping by all the time, sometimes groups of individuals, dropping by all the time laying hands on me, praying for me. My staff knows that when a group comes in and when they leave my bow tie is crooked, they know that I was worked over by that group,"" he said. ""And they are here to demonstrate to the forces of evil you cannot win. Greater is He who is in us than he who is in the world."""

Unless something changes, it will happen starting next year through federal retirement plans. The somewhat quiet decision will affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers including our military.
""The single most important thing we can do about the emerging and burgeoning China threat, is to stop underwriting it,"" said Frank Gaffney who leads the Committee on the Present Danger: China.
He charges Wall Street is behind this underwriting effort because Morgan Stanley includes certain Chinese companies in its retirement portfolio. 
Gaffney says trillions pour into companies that not only promote human rights violations but also literally fight against us, like Aviation Industry Corporation of China.

""Building actual weapons systems designed to kill American servicemen and women and for that matter the rest of us,"" Gaffney says.
He is speaking out now because the US government sits ready to follow private industry.  
The board overseeing the Federal Retirement Thrift Savings plan has decided to include these same companies in its portfolio. This would affect service members, Congress, and the president's cabinet. Rep. Jim Banks is behind legislation that would prevent those federal funds from being invested in Chinese companies.
""Really we're talking about millions of dollars that are invested on behalf of federal employees,"" Banks said. ""It's almost hypocritical for the federal government to allow for those individuals who have worked for the federal government…to see their money being invested in companies who are very much antithetical to the interest of the United States.""
Hank Paulson served as Treasury Secretary for President George W. Bush. 
""Decoupling China from US markets by delisting Chinese firms from US exchanges is a terrible idea,"" Paulson said.
Paulson says the US survived the 2008 financial crisis by coordinating with other key economies like China's. He disagrees with the argument that American investment in Chinese companies threatens national security.
""Even as we build a high fence around a small yard to protect national security, we must not impair our individual and shared economic security and that of the rest of the world,"" Paulson said.
Gaffney insists that outlook is a mistake.
""On the one hand you've got the financial security which pretty much doesn't care about national security, it's all about the money,"" Gaffney says.  ""On the other hand you've got the national security guys who, by and large, with some exceptions, they don't know anything about finance.""
And in between, he says, lurks a dangerous place where the Chinese Communist Party has learned to thrive.
""It's simply scandalous,"" Gaffney said.
Gaffney and others like Congressman Banks hope sounding the alarm will help stop this type of foreign investment into the Thrift Savings Plan, but it's a long shot. "

“In every generation, Jewish American patriots have strengthened, sustained, uplifted, and inspired our nation,” Trump said, according to the White House.  “In a moment, the Shalva Band will conclude this event with a song that we know very well.  Before they do, I want to tell the famous story behind it.”
While the audience waited for the performance, President Trump passionately explained the details behind the famous song written by Irving Berlin.

“In 1918, a young Jewish American soldier stationed at Camp Upton, in New York, wrote a prayer in the form of a song,” Trump explained. “His name was Irving Berlin — may be the greatest of them all.  And he held that song close to his heart for more than 20 years.  He did not release the song until 1938, as the world learned of Hitler’s evil atrocities against the Jewish people. On November 10th of that year, his song broadcast through the radio and into the homes all across the country.  Millions and millions of people were inspired.  It was the first time Americans heard Irving Berlin’s timeless hymn, “God Bless America,” he said, drawing healthy applause from the crowd.

It was a time in which America was not afraid to pray. President Franklin D. Roosevelt would often lead the nation in prayer on his radio broadcasts, especially during the war. Trump fondly recalled the way the nation reacted to the song as a song of prayer.
“These words became the prayer of our nation, the prayer that traveled to the islands of the Pacific, to the beaches of Normandy, and all the way to Nazi territory, where American soldiers open the gates of concentration camps and liberated Jewish survivors,” he said.
Trump then went on to explain that the song has been something we have turned to often in times of trouble throughout our nation’s history, even to this day.
“It’s the prayer that Americans sang as we faced down communism and as we came together as one nation after 9/11.  It’s the prayer that still unites us today and the hope that burns bright in our hearts because we are proud American patriots,” Trump said.  “We love this magnificent nation with every ounce of our strength, spirit, and soul.”
With that, Trump concluded by inviting the musicians to begin playing. It was a powerful scene to see the song performed so beautifully, after such a wonderful setup.
“So tonight, together, we ask that God bless our military.  We ask that God bless our veterans.  We ask that God bless our cherished ally, the State of Israel.  And with our flag-waving high, our people standing tall, and our faith forever strong, we say our prayer once more: God bless America, our home sweet home.”

Fired up Republicans quickly offered their rebuttal.
""It is not difficult to defend this president, but it is very difficult to defend this Congress and what they have done, and history will not be kind to them,"" noted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). 
Republicans maintain President Trump is innocent and Democrats are abusing the powers of impeachment because they dislike the president.

This is not only a win for lawmakers but also for President Trump. The commander-in-chief calls this the ""largest trade deal ever made,"" and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sees it as ""a victory for America's workers."" 
House Democrats struck the trade deal with the White House despite the intensifying impeachment drama.

""Every once in a while you get to participate in a 'it will never happen' moment,"" Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) said. 
Pelosi admitted Democrats in Congress had held up the trade deal so they could get what they wanted. ""We were in range for a while but until we could cross a certain threshold of enforcement for our workers' rights, for the environment, for prescription drug issue..."" she explained.
This move comes after President Trump criticized Pelosi and her team as ""do nothing"" Democrats. 
The US, Mexico, and Canada reached the agreement last year. President Trump's just been waiting for the House to approve it ever since. He said there's a reason the Democrats made their announcement on the same day they announced impeachment articles.
""And then an hour later she announced that she's going to do USMCA. You know why? It's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment. And our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment,"" Trump said.
""We came a long way from what he originally proposed,"" Pelosi said. ""There are some people who say why make it look like he has a victory? We are declaring victory for the American worker by what is in this agreement.""
Since President Trump signed the USMCA last year, the White House has been trying to win over House Democrats to get the deal through Congress. 
""There is no question that this trade agreement is much better than NAFTA,"" Pelosi admitted.
Even Republicans seemed to give the new deal the green light. House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy said, ""If we are going to be competing we need to be stronger. We would get a better commitment with China if we had USMCA done, we would be in a stronger position."" 
US Trade Representative Robert Lightizer, White House advisor Jared Kushner and the Canadian Deputy Prime Minister are expected to be in Mexico City on Tuesday for a signing ceremony.
 
In the meantime, President Trump is fighting back on impeachment via Twitter calling it a witch hunt, adding ""Nadler just said that I pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 election. Ridiculous, and he knows that is not true.""

House Judiciary Committee Moves Forward with Impeachment Hearing, Republicans Call It a 'Farce' 
The filing of the articles is a major step in Democrats’ efforts to make Trump the third US president to be impeached. It is only the fourth time in history that Congress has attempted to remove a sitting President from office.
The House Judiciary Committee could vote on the articles later this week, sending them to the House floor where lawmakers will need a majority vote to send them to the Senate.
If the articles pass in the House, the case will move to the Senate for a formal trial likely beginning in January, the Wall Street Journal reports.
Democratic lawmakers announced the charges against Trump at a press conference on Tuesday morning after more than 100 hours of deposition and 17 witnesses.
Notably absent from The Post’s report on the charges was a “bribery” count. Democrats have repeatedly accused Trump of bribing Ukraine with military aid to investigate political rival, Joe Biden. CNN reported that Democrats debated whether to also include another article of “obstruction of justice” related to allegations in the Mueller report.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi met with her team Monday evening after a 10-hour Judiciary Committee but declined to discuss the articles or the impending announcement.
When asked if she thinks she has enough votes in the House to move the case to the Senate, Pelosi said she has not counted the votes. 
“On an issue like this, we don’t count the votes. People will just make their voices known on it,” Pelosi said at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council. ""I haven’t counted votes, nor will I.”
Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters Monday while exiting Pelosi’s office that “a lot of us believe what happened with Ukraine especially is not something we can just close our eyes to.”
“I think there's a lot of agreement,” he said. ""You’ll hear about some of it tomorrow.”
The filing of the articles is a major step in Democrats’ efforts to make Trump the third US president to be impeached.
During Monday’s lengthy judiciary committee, Democrats argued that Trump’s push to have Ukraine investigate Biden while withholding military aid constitutes a violation of US policy and benefitted both himself and Russia.
“President Trump’s persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security,” said Dan Goldman, the director of investigations at the House Intelligence Committee.
Republicans dismissed the allegations against Trump. Rep Doug Collins (R-GA), who serves on the judiciary committee, said the impeachment process is like a criminal proceeding with no crime.
“We don’t have a crime; we don’t have anything we actually can defend,” he said.
Collins also accused Democrats of trying to force impeachment before the 2020 presidential election.
“They can't get over the fact that Donald Trump is the president of the United States, and they don’t have a candidate that can beat him,"" Collins said.
The White House is refusing to participate in the impeachment process. While Trump’s allies acknowledge that he will likely be impeached in the Democratic-controlled House. However, they expect acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate."

While those articles are expected to be released later this week, Democrats and Republicans on Monday took what could be their final opportunity to plead their cases to the public. 
For the House part of this impeachment process, the end could soon be near. Both sides hope to finish strong and win in the coveted court of public opinion as they plead their cases.

""To impeach a president who 63 million American people voted for over eight lines in a call transcript is baloney,"" countered Steve Castor, GOP counsel. 
Tensions flared between lawmakers at many points throughout the day's hearings.

Bush, announced his candidacy Monday for a congressional seat in Texas, becoming the latest member of his famous Republican family to enter politics.
But his first run for office won’t be easy. Bush joins one of the nation’s most crowded congressional races of 2020 in his bid to replace Republican Rep. Pete Olson, who is retiring from his suburban Houston district that Democrats nearly flipped last year and are aggressively targeting again.
Pierce Bush’s announcement video, rolled out on the deadline in Texas for candidates to get on the 2020 ballot, includes an image of him speaking next to a picture of his late grandfather, who died last year.
“We face a very challenging time in our nation,” Bush says, adding that the country is “on the brink of losing a generation to an idea that socialism and free stuff are the answers to their future. But we all know that socialism has failed everywhere and everyone.”
His candidacy opens a new test for the Bush name in the Trump era. Other Republican candidates in the field have expressed unwavering support for President Donald Trump, who has clashed with the Bush family that for decades defined the GOP establishment. George H.W Bush voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and President George W. Bush didn’t vote for either one of them.
The only Bush currently in public office, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, broke with his family in 2016 and supported Trump. During a visit to Texas earlier this year, Trump introduced George P. Bush, who is the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, as “the only Bush that likes me.”
Pierce Bush, whose father is Neil Bush, has spent the past three years as chief executive of the nonprofit Big Brothers Big Sisters in Texas. He made no mention of Trump in his announcement video and launched his campaign website with only a short biography and no positions on issues or policies.
Olson is one of six of House Republicans in Texas retiring next year, and he might have faced tougher re-election battled than any of them. Once a seat of GOP power — former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay held the office before Olson — the district is rapidly shifting amid demographic changes and Democrats peeling off suburban women voters.
Olson narrowly won his seat by fewer than 5 points in 2018. The district covers Fort Bend County, one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the nation. Last week, the county’s white Republican state representative, Rick Miller, abruptly dropped his re-election bid after telling the Houston Chronicle that his primary challengers were motivated to run against him because of race, accusing one of determining “that my district might need an Asian to win.”"

The committee will convene on Monday to formally receive the Intelligence Committee's report on the impeachment inquiry.
Attorneys with the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees put together their case over the weekend on at least two or more charges against President Trump.

Mark Meadows (R-NC) told CBS's Face The Nation on Sunday, ""I don't see a single Republican defecting. They've looked at the facts and know where we are on this.""
If the committee approves the articles by Friday, that would set up a full House vote before Christmas, and a Senate trial in January.
The top Republican on the panel, Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) asked to postpone the hearing, criticizing Democrats for moving too swiftly. One legal scholar testified last week it would be the quickest impeachment in modern history.

Democrat Breaks Ranks, Warns His Party on Impeachment
Earlier this year Pelosi said impeachment had to be bipartisan, but all Republicans are united against it.

That is to say, I think we'll see some Democrats vote no, and I think you'll see the Democrats that vote yes will have some serious questions to answer to their constituents.""
    
He's right. Already Democratic Congressman Jeff Van Drew says he plans to vote against all articles of impeachment and warns Democrats to ""be careful what you wish for.""
Van Drew represents a district in New Jersey that voted for the president in 2016. Other Democrats in similar situations may follow his lead.
Pelosi Snaps at Reporter
Meanwhile, in her weekly press conference, a typically poised Pelosi got riled when journalist James Rosen asked if she hates the president.
Pointing her finger Pelosi cited her Catholic Faith.
""I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president. And I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So, don't mess with me when it comes to words like that,"" she said before walking off stage.
Trump responded to Pelosi on Twitter, saying he doesn't think she's praying for him at all. ""She says she 'prays for the President.' I don't believe her, not even close.""
In a Senate impeachment trial, Republicans will likely call House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff,  who presided over the first round of impeachment hearings, as a witness.
Hunter Biden's ties to Ukraine will also be under the microscope.
Biden's Bad Day in Iowa
On the campaign trail in Iowa, Joe Biden engaged in a heated exchange with a voter who suggested he helped his son get a sweetheart gig on the board of a Ukrainian company in exchange for access to the Obama administration.
Biden responded by cursing and calling the man a liar. Then he launched into a fiery response.
""That's not true. And no one has ever said that. No one has proved that,"" he said as he walked toward the man who stood to speak at the town hall event.
After challenging his questioner to a push-up contest and an IQ test, Biden claimed, ""No one has said my son has done anything wrong, and I did not on any occasion, and no one has ever said it.""
As the heated exchange continued, Biden said, ""You said I set up my son to work in an oil company. Isn't that what you said? Get your words straight, Jack."" 
What's Next for Impeachment
Back on Capitol Hill, the House Judiciary Committee will hear a report outlining findings against the president. The full House expects to vote on impeachment - possibly right before Christmas - setting up a January trial in the Senate.
And the big question: will this public show end up hurting moderate Democrats in the long run?

More than half of Americans believe that churches and religious organizations are good for the country, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. But in a seemingly contradictory result, 63 percent say the church and other houses of worship should stay out of politics.
In other words, Americans think the church has a positive impact on society, but they also think the church should keep quiet on cultural and political issues that set the present and future course for our society. Or more directly: Churches, you make this country better, now stay out of the important matters that define our country. 
Huh?
For evangelicals such as myself, this issue has profound personal implications. As my former pastor repeatedly said, the church is not a building, it is a movement. Accordingly, a push to keep the church out of a particular part of society is effectively a push to exclude Christians.
But should any group remove itself (or be involuntarily removed) from the workings of our constitutional republic?
We live in a representative form of government, which means that we elect individuals to represent us in matters of personal, local, and national significance. The policies adopted and laws passed by those representatives impact the present and future of every citizen. They impact our families, our children's education, our businesses, our churches, our local communities, our states, and the world.
As citizens, we have a moral obligation to participate in culture, public policy, and yes…politics. 
If you are a Christian, you have a spiritual obligation to be ""salt and light"" by seeking the good of your community. This means Christians are called to live out our faith outside the four walls of our homes. We need to be involved not just in our churches, but in our communities.
Despite this reality, and consistent with the survey results mentioned above, ""I'm not political"" has become a popular refrain from people of faith. It also serves as shorthand for voluntary abstention from any public debate pertaining to ""hot button"" issues. Christians might say, ""I'm eager to share the gospel, but I don't want to address topics including same-sex marriage, abortion, gender identity, human sexuality, euthanasia, healthcare, immigration, and the welfare system. I just want to talk about the gospel.""
Wait.
Gospel means ""good news."" As you thumb through the pages of the Bible, you'll find a message of hope on any number of topics. There is good news about our inherent value as humans, from our mother's womb all the way to natural death. There is also good news about how God has uniquely made men and women. And there is good news about God's design for marriage as a reflection of Christ and the church.
This is not to suggest that every Christian will hold identical views on certain complex matters, such as the best way to structure healthcare, or how to address the immigration crisis, or what it will take to jettison the ""crazy"" from the educational system. But the Bible has plenty to say on a host of issues, and where it lacks specificity, it offers general principles that should be carefully considered. 
Lest we forget, the Bible is unlike any other book ever written. Sixty-six ancient manuscripts completed over a span of more than 1,500 years by 40 authors on three continents. It offers timeless and proven principles for life, relationships, marriage, parenting, and so much more. Should we simply cast it aside when it comes to the laws and policies we endorse? And the candidates we support? 
In any instance, Christians should take care not to abandon our role, both as citizens and as messengers for the gospel. Jesus didn't die on the cross and redeem and transform us so that we could be quarantined from the culture. He came to save us so that we could permeate the culture, serving as ambassadors to a world in need of Him.

Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford (R) says even though the government is collecting more tax revenue than at any other time in American history, the country is still drowning in debt.
The overall national debt stands at $23 trillion right now – and Lankford warns that could sink our economy.
“We're approaching a time where it would take the income of every single American for the entire year to be collected as taxes to pay off our debt,"" he says.
""These kinds of numbers can't be sustained, and everyone quietly knows it in the back of their mind, but dealing with debt and deficit seems to be one of those things we'll deal with the future, someday, someday, someday,"" he continues. ""We should be taking on the issues of debt and deficit now.""
For example, US taxpayers paid $371 billion on interest payments alone on America's national debt just last year. And this year we'll spend $423 billion on interest payments. Lankford points out that money could have been used for health care, transportation, or national defense, but instead it was spent on nothing.
Lankford’s office has put out its latest annual “Federal Fumbles” report, documenting foolish federal spending. He argues that smaller cases of wasteful spending need to be tackled to address the bigger, looming debt crisis.
Here are a few examples:
A nearly $2 million study on sea lions in Russia;
A $600,000 documentary on Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin;
Almost half a billion dollars to rent tents, instead of buying them, along the southern border.
Overall, the report lists $383 billion in wasteful and inefficient federal spending. The senator suggested just cutting out all the government’s wasteful spending could save tens of billions of dollars a year.

Lawmakers heard from four constitutional scholars on what constitutes ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Democrats called three witnesses. Republicans had one.
""If what we're talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" said Prof. Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina Law School.

House Committee Releases Trump Impeachment Inquiry Report, Republicans Submit Response
The scholars brought in by Democrats argued that the Ukraine scandal is proof President Trump abused his power for personal political gain. All three believe he should be impeached.
""President Trump's conduct as described in the testimony and evidence, clearly constitutes impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution,"" said Prof. Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School.
Republicans were allowed to call one of their own experts, who didn't defend the president but argued Democrats are moving too fast and have not proven their case.
""It's wrong because this is not how you impeach an American president,"" said Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School. ""Why would you want to set the record for the fastest impeachment? Fast is not good for impeachment.""
Turley noted that he's not a fan of Trump and didn't vote for him, adding more credibility to his non-partisan testimony.

Prof. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School testifies in House impeachment hearing.
""I get it. You are mad. The President is mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My Republican friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog is mad.... and Luna is a golden doodle and they are never mad. We are all mad and where has it taken us? Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration? That is why this is wrong,"" Turley said in his prepared remarks.
Turley argues the Democrats' case against Trump is being rushed and the evidence is flimsy at this point.
One moment that went viral came when the Democrats' third witness invoked the president's young son's name.
 
""The Constitution says there can be no titles of nobility,"" said Prof. Pamela Karan of Stanford Law School. ""So while the president can name his son Barron, he can't make him a baron.""
Barron Trump is only 13 years old, and Republican lawmakers pushed back sharply about his name being dragged into the hearing.
""Let me also suggest that when you invoke the president's son's name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump, that does not lend credibility to your argument,"" said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL). ""It makes you look mean.""
First Lady Melania Trump also shot back on Twitter saying ""a minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics.""
Karlan later apologized. ""It was wrong of me to do that,"" she admitted on the witness stand.
Overseas at NATO, President Trump called the hearing ""boring"" and criticized its fairness.
""They get three constitutional lawyers and we get one. What's that all about?"" he told reporters. ""We had no representation. We couldn't call witnesses. We couldn't do anything. It is the most unfair thing that anybody's ever seen.""
CBN's chief political analyst David Brody said Democrats ""botched"" the hearing and didn't break any new ground.
""When it's partisan like this and you want to move public opinion, you can't be more partisan,"" he said. ""You have to somehow figure out a way to get more of the public on your side. They didn't do that.""
The White House has until the end of Thursday to decide if it will participate in any of the next hearings. A full House vote is expected before Christmas."

Bloomberg, a businessman and former mayor of New York City, is worth approximately $56 billion, ranking him among the top ten richest people in America.
He is also a passionate abortion advocate. In 2014, he led a $50 million initiative to help women in Nicaragua, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Uganda “freely and safely make decisions about when to have children,” by attaining abortions.
As mayor of New York, he championed the issued by supporting a Manhattan statute that ensured public OB-GYN residents were taught how to perform abortions.
“When I was elected mayor, one of the first things we did was make sure that all city hospitals teach OB-GYN residents reproductive care, including how to safely perform abortions – something we did amid much criticism,” he said of the program, according to ChristianHeadlines.
In a recent column at Newsmax, Catholic activist Bill Donohue called Bloomberg “one of the most radical pro-abortion politicians in American history.”
“Bloomberg’s passion for abortion allowed him to appropriate $15 million from a civic facility revenue bond transaction that benefited Planned Parenthood,” Donohue added. “In 2012, the proceeds of the bond were used to finance the renovation of 104,000 square feet of space in the building that housed the abortion giant, supplying it with equipment and furnishing.”

Those on the inside, it seems, agree.
“To say he’s one of the biggest champions for women in this country and all over the world would be an understatement,” Jill Lafer, a former national chairwoman of Planned Parenthood, told The New York Times after Bloomberg made a cash donation of $250,000 to the group.
“The stakes could not be higher,” Bloomberg said after he announced his candidacy. “We must win this election.” Unfortunately for him, the polling numbers indicate that this is almost impossible.
“Mike Bloomberg is one of the richest men in the world,” wrote Jake Novak at CNBC. “But he’s about to learn a priceless lesson: You can’t buy the American presidency.”"

Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor who was called by Republicans to testify, opened his remarks by making one thing clear.
""I'm not a supporter of President Trump. I voted against him,"" Turley declared.
Turley then, however, laid out his case for why he's against impeaching Trump.
""I believe this impeachment not only fails to satisfy the standard of past impeachments but would create a dangerous precedent for future impeachments,"" Turley explained. ""To impeach a president on this record would expose every future president to the same type of inchoate impeachment.""
And he cautioned Democrats about pursuing the charge of obstruction of justice as well.
""Obstruction is a crime with meaning. It has elements. It has case authority,"" Turley continued. ""The record does not establish obstruction in this case. What my esteemed colleague said was certainly true. If you accept all of their presumptions, it would be obstruction. But impeachments have to be based on proof, not presumptions.""
But the other witnesses cautioned about a different precedent being set. 
""If what we're talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" declared UNC law professor Michael Gerhardt.
The three Democrat witnesses also expressed concern Trump might solicit foreign interference again. 
""The evidence reveals a president who used the powers of his office to demand that a foreign government participate in undermining a competing candidate for the presidency,"" said Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan.
While it is still not certain articles of impeachment will be brought to the House floor, Democrats appear ready to move forward.
""We cannot wait for the election to address the present crisis,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said.
Republicans argue Democrats have planned this since they lost the 2016 election.
""You just don't like the guy,"" said Ranking Member Doug Collins (R-GA). ""You didn't like him since November of 2016.""
The House Judiciary Committee will be tasked with officially drawing up articles of impeachment if they decide to move forward. But Democrats say there is no specific timeline yet on when the articles could be brought to the House floor."

But does that mean all holy activities must be separated from government?  One group says definitely not.  It's an assembly of Christians who, every year, just feet from the US Supreme Court, bring alive the night of Jesus Christ's birth.
 
It's not just a religious gathering but a Live lesson about Americans' religious liberty rights.  
The scene those Christians present is a live Nativity, including baby Jesus and all those, both two-legged and four-legged, that might have gathered around His manger.   That means a camel, a cow, and goats parading around Capitol Hill, much to the delight of tourists and families passing by, who stopped in droves to snap photos and selfies with the beasts.
 
Peggy Nienaber as the vice president of the religious rights group Faith & Liberty helps organize the Live Nativity every year.
 
She told CBN News, ""A lot of the people forget it between the hustle and the bustle, all the stuff that goes on – the politics on Capitol Hill – there's a reason that we do this: it's the reason for the season and it's the birth of Jesus Christ.""  
 
Some might argue that the specific location of this Nativity scene violates the separation of church and state. Lawyer Mat Staver, the founder of the Liberty Counsel, says it really doesn't.
 
""There is no separation of church and state that requires the government to censor religious viewpoints and speech,"" Staver argued. ""In fact, it's actually the opposite.  The government cannot censor religious speech. And this is clearly the essential message of the Christmas season.""
 
Nienaber added, ""Our First Amendment right gives us the right to get permits and to hold different events on Capitol Hill, and our event happens to be our outreach, which is the live Nativity.""
 
Participants prayed, worshipped, read the Nativity story from the Bible – and that was all.
 
""We're not mixing politics in with this,"" Nienaber explained.  ""We're not pushing any kind of legislation.  We're just letting you know what the true time of the year is.""
 
Staver added, ""And sharing that with not only the people here in the nation's capital but people around the world, who'll be surprised as they see a live Nativity in front of the United States Supreme Court.""

Now, the Ukrainian billionaire who hired him is under investigation and is reported to be in hiding.  
Mykola (Nikolay) Zlochevsky, one of the most powerful men in Ukraine, hired Biden as a company director and head of the legal department at Burisma Holdings, Ukraine's largest private oil and gas producer, and paid him $50,000 a month, despite the fact that Biden had little to no experience in the energy sector or Ukrainian law. Biden was used as the face of Burisma in a company promotional video.
In an ABC News interview, Biden was asked why he got the job without extensive knowledge of the natural gas industry or Ukraine. He said, ""I think I had as much knowledge as anybody else on the board, if not more.""
But during the impeachment inquiry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent said Biden's involvement with Burisma, while his father, Vice President Joe Biden, was negotiating with Ukraine, was a cause of concern. 
Kent testified, ""There was the perception of a conflict of interest.""
And now Hunter Biden finds himself tied to a businessman suspected of the theft of government funds on an especially large scale, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor who has reopened all investigations involving Zlochevsky amid allegations of embezzling state funds. 
  
While serving as Ukraine's ecology minister, Zlochevsky was suspected of providing gas production licenses and permits to his own companies. There are also allegations of tax evasion. 
But Ukrainian authorities reportedly do not know Zlochevsky's whereabouts. One report says he's hiding out in Monaco.

Legal and constitutional experts are taking the stand to discuss constitutional grounds for impeachment.
""This is the result of a president who believes that he is beyond indictment, beyond impeachment, beyond any form of accountability and indeed above the law,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) claimed in a press conference.
On Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines to release a 300-page report on its investigation into alleged misconduct by President Trump in regard to Ukraine.
The report accuses the president of putting his personal, political interests above national interests and obstructing justice by forbidding White House aides to testify.
""This is not about Ukraine. This is about our democracy. This is about our national security,"" Schiff said.
The president responded from the NATO Summit in London.
""I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being. I think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious. I think he is a very sick man,"" Trump told the media.
Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Chief of Staff Milk Mulvaney are also implicated in the report, accused of being complicit in the president's push to withhold military aid from Ukraine for political purposes.
In a press conference virtually ignored by the media, Republicans released a report of their own, pointing out that the impeachment inquiry did not meet Speaker Pelosi's criteria of compelling, overwhelming and bi-partisan. 
""They have one big problem and the problem is that the president did nothing wrong,"" said Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee. ""And they can't prove it.""
Now Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee will try to make their case that Trump's conduct constitutes grounds for impeachment. Then they'll officially draft the articles of impeachment. 
The lone GOP witness in the Judiciary Committee hearings is 
George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. Politico reports Turley believes the case is flimsy and that it would be a historic mistake for Democrats to impeach Trump with such little evidence.
 
""If the House proceeds solely on the Ukrainian allegations, this impeachment would stand out among modern impeachments as the shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president,"" Turley says.
The full House is expected to vote on the articles before Christmas. If approved, there would be a Senate trial.
President Trump said he's willing to let his closest advisers testify in a Senate trial, where he says the process will be fair, unlike what he calls the 'sham' process in the House.
Trump's approval ratings have stayed pretty locked in and voter's opinions haven't changed since the start of the hearings: 47 percent support removing Trump while 43 percent are opposed."

Trump signed the bills, which were approved by near-unanimous consent in the House and Senate, even as he expressed some concerns about complicating the effort to work out a trade deal with China’s President Xi Jinping.
“I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong,” Trump said in a statement. “They are being enacted in the hope that Leaders and Representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all.”
Congress approved the bills last week following months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. Before Wednesday’s signing announcement, Trump would only commit to giving the measures a “hard look.”
China had threatened to take unspecified, “strong countermeasures” if the bills were signed into law.
The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act mandates sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who carry out human rights abuses and requires an annual review of the favorable trade status that Washington grants Hong Kong.
Another bill prohibits export to Hong Kong police of certain nonlethal munitions, including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, water cannons, stun guns and tasers.
The munitions bill was passed unanimously, while Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the sole House member to oppose the human rights bill.
Trump acknowledged last week that he was weighing the ramifications of signing the bill.
“Look, we have to stand with Hong Kong,” Trump said in an interview on “Fox & Friends.” He continued: “But I’m also standing with President Xi. He’s a friend of mine. He’s an incredible guy.”
Democratic and Republican lawmakers applauded the signing of the bills. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said it “finally sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of Hong Kong: We are with you.”
Sen. Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican, and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said the bills are “an important step forward in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy and its repression of fundamental human rights.”

The Judiciary panel scheduled its first hearing for Dec. 4 as it decides whether to write articles of impeachment against Trump. 
The committee takes over the process handled so far by the Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Trump's alleged efforts to push Ukraine to take action against his political rivals.
Trump and his lawyers have been invited to attend the hearing and make a request to question witnesses, according to Democratic rules approved by the House last month. The committee released a letter from is chairman Jerrold Nadler, (D-NY), to the Republican president, saying he hopes Trump will participate, ""consistent with the rules of decorum and with the solemn nature of the work before us.""
The White House said Wednesday no decision had been made whether to send a representative.
""But what is obvious to every American is that this letter comes at the end of an illegitimate sham partisan process,"" press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.
The Intelligence Committee is wrapping up its investigative phase of the probe and preparing its report for the next phase of the process. 
Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has said the report could be released soon after the House returns from its Thanksgiving break.
Meanwhile, media outlets are reporting that even though Republicans and Democrats rarely agree on anything these days, there is one thing on which they do agree:  the impeachment hearings are a waste of time and money. 
""Everything they say, it's so repetitive. To me, it's like they're beating their heads against the wall,"" said Harry Rose, a 78-year-old retired factory worker and Trump supporter in Racine County, a swing county in the swing state of Wisconsin.
A Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin registered voters that were conducted during the first week of the impeachment hearings showed 47% of registered voters approve of the job Trump is doing, and more expressed opposition than support for impeachment and removal, 53% to 40%, figures largely unchanged from October."

This move by the court contradicts President Trump's order for McGahn not to testify.
But the Justice Department is telling the court not so fast. On Tuesday, they filed an appeal to the judge's order.
If you read the bulk of the appeal, it points out that it's only the second time in history a court has ruled a senior advisor to the president must testify.
A new Politico/Morning Consult poll reveals that two weeks of testimony didn't move the needle much when it comes to swaying voters.
The survey found 48% back the impeachment inquiry, which is unchanged from a previous poll. While 43% oppose, which is down by two points.
President Trump tweeted ""support for impeachment is dropping like a rock.""
White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway echoed the President Tuesday at the White House.
""I think Pelosi is stuck but she put herself thereby not doing serious things like USMCA, reducing drug prices, raising wage growth. All of this is happening without a serious democratic congress,"" Conway said.
To top that, the tide could be turning against impeachment after one Michigan Democrat lawmaker has changed sides. 
Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-MI) is now calling for a resolution to censure the President.  With the 2020 Elections so close, she sees ""no value"" in impeachment.
She does believe it's important for the House to go on record calling Trump's actions wrong.
""She is in a heavily Democratic district. I would assume she is a loyal Democratic member but she made very clear we are so close to the next election that, that gives her pause as well,"" Conway said. ""That's something we say often but here you have a Democratic member of Congress saying it as well.""
Her move could lead Democrats in swing districts to also come out against impeachment. "

A White House official says Trump has given the $100,000 he would be paid in the quarter to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, which oversees federal public health offices and programs, including the surgeon general’s office.
The White House says the funds are being earmarked “to continue the ongoing fight against the opioid crisis.”
Trump has made tackling the misuse of opioids an administration priority. More than 70,000 Americans died in 2017 from drug overdoses, the bulk of them involving opioids.
Trump is required to be paid, but he has pledged to donate his salary while in office to worthy causes. Trump donated his second-quarter salary to the surgeon general’s office.

The delay allows the justices to decide how to handle the House subpoena and a similar demand from the Manhattan district attorney at the same time.
The House’s quest for the records is not part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry, but the court’s action probably means Democrats will not have the records before an expected vote on impeachment by year’s end.
The justices are giving Trump until Dec. 5 to file a full appeal of a lower court ruling calling for his accountants to turn over the records. The president’s lawyers are certain to comply, and the court’s decision about whether to take up the case is not expected before mid-January.
The House Committee on Oversight and Reform had argued that Trump’s case was too weak to earn a delay from the court. There was no noted dissent from the court’s unsigned order.
The New York case centers on Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s subpoena for Trump’s tax returns from the same accounting firm, Mazars USA. Legal briefs have been filed by both sides in that case.
The justices now should be able to say at the same time whether they will take up the cases and decide them by late June.

CBN News takes a look at how his late entry could affect the race.
Bloomberg's campaign is already shaping up to look far different than his rivals. With an estimated worth of $53 billion, Bloomberg says he won't take a penny in campaign donations. If elected, he'll work for one dollar a year, and he'll spend whatever it takes to win the nomination.
Over the next two weeks, he hopes to introduce himself to voters courtesy of a $37 million television advertising campaign. A sum that totals more than half of the $50 million spent thus far on TV ads by the current field of Democrat presidential candidates

""We do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections,"" Sanders said. 
""You can't buy passion,"" Yang responded. ""If you have to put people against money, I will take people every day of the week.

Ahead of his campaign announcement, the 77-year-old former Republican visited an African American megachurch in Brooklyn, New York, to apologize for his controversial stop and frisk policy.
""I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong,"" he told the congregation. 
Bloomberg argues he's the antithesis of Donald Trump, who he calls a ""failed businessman whose companies went bankrupt multiple times"" while touting himself as a ""proven leader with an unmatched track record in business and government.""
""Beating Trump and rebuilding America is the most urgent and important fight of our lives, and I'm going all in,"" the former New York City mayor said. 
On Monday, he kicked his campaign off at an event in Norfolk, VA. 
 ""If President Trump wins another term in office we may never recover from the damage that he can do,"" Bloomberg told the audience. 
CBN News spoke with several people at Monday's campaign event. Their reaction was mixed on how they feel about Bloomberg jumping in the race. Some were excited while others don't quite know who he is. 
With ten weeks to go before the Iowa caucus, it's unclear if his massive war chest will be able to buy support and name recognition in those crucial first voting states where his opponents have been campaigning for months.  "

At Esper’s request, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer submitted his resignation Sunday, said the chief spokesman for the Pentagon, Jonathan Hoffman.
  
The firing was a dramatic turn in a fast-changing and politically charged controversy involving Navy Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher. On Wednesday the Navy had notified Gallagher that he would face a Navy SEAL review board to determine if he should be allowed to remain in the elite force.
  
Gallagher was acquitted of a murder charge in the stabbing death of an Islamic State militant captive, but a military jury convicted him of posing with the corpse while in Iraq in 2017. He was demoted from chief petty officer to a 1st class petty officer. Trump this month restored Gallagher’s rank.
  
In a statement issued by Hoffman, Esper said he had lost “trust and confidence” in Spencer after learning that the Navy secretary had “privately” proposed to the White House to allow Gallagher to retire in his current rank and without losing his status as a SEAL. Esper said that in previous conversations with Spencer about the Gallagher matter, Spencer had not told Esper of his proposal to the White House.
  
Esper faulted Spencer for a “lack of candor” on the matter.
  
A spokesperson for Spencer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  
Esper on Sunday directed that Gallagher be allowed to retire at the end of this month, and that the Navy review board that was scheduled to hear his case starting Dec. 2 be cancelled, Hoffman said. At Esper’s direction, Gallagher will be allowed to retire as a SEAL at his current rank, Hoffman said. He said Esper had concluded that Gallagher could not, under the circumstances, receive a fair shake from the Navy, and thus should be allowed to retire.
  
In the written statement, Esper said of Spencer: “I am deeply troubled by this conduct shown by a senior DOD official. Unfortunately, as a result I have determined that Secretary Spencer no longer has my confidence to continue in his position. I wish Richard well.""

On Friday, President Trump said bring it on, telling Fox News that ""he wants a trial,"" and that he knows the identity of the whistleblower. 
""Should the whistleblower be fired, Mr. President?"" a reporter asked. 
""What whistleblower? I don't think there is...,"" Trump replied. 
Democrats disagree crediting the whistleblower for the tip on the infamous July 25 call with Ukraine's president which sparked an impeachment inquiry. 
At the center of the allegations, the President froze aid to Ukraine to force an investigation into Joe Biden's son. 
Calling it a ""false report"", Trump told Fox News he wants the whistleblower to testify. 
""I know exactly who it is, everybody does,"" Trump said. 
""Is he still there?,"" the Fox News host asked.
""Everybody knows who the whistleblower is. You know who the whistleblower is to otherwise you're not doing your job,"" the President responded. 
Trump announced he's now pushing for a Senate trial should the House impeach him. This move would allow Republicans to call their own witnesses, including Hunter Biden.
""There is only one person I want more than Hunter Biden and that is Adam Schiff,"" Trump said. 
Schiff has brought in a wide range of witnesses including former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. 
""This ambassador that everybody says is so wonderful. She wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy. She wouldn't hang it. It took like a year and a half, or two years for her to get the picture up.

Will US-China trade talks – something the president has worked hard to negotiate with the leaders of the world's second largest economy – be jeopardized? China has threatened to take tough counter measures if Trump signs the Hong Kong measure.
Members of Congress sent a powerful signal to China Thursday by standing with the pro-democracy protestors of Hong Kong.

""If America does not speak up for human rights in China because of commercial issues, we lose all moral authority to speak about human rights anywhere in the world,"" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi insisted. 
At least 23 more protestors left Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Thursday after days of the worst anti-government violence since Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests began.  
""The protests have continued because the people of Hong Kong see what's coming. They see the steady effort to erode the autonomy and their freedoms,"" said US Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).
 
Delaware Sen. Chris Coons (D) explained why he also supported the measure saying, ""The United States has long stood as a beacon of freedom and a country that supports and calls out to those who are demonstrating to their rights. We need to be a more forceful and effective voice in Hong Kong.""
The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is more than just symbolic – government officials responsible for violating human rights in Hong Kong could be subjected to tough sanctions including visa bans and the freezing of their assets in US banks.  Another bill approved by Congress suspends the sale of munitions to Hong Kong police.
China responded angrily. Meeting with former US Defense Secretary William Cohen in Beijing Thursday, China's foreign minister said the US move is ""a stark interference in China's internal affairs.""
But protestors say police have killed some of them, like the demonstrator who was shot point blank in the chest last week. Hong Kong police have also reportedly sprayed chemical-laced water on pro-democracy protestors.

The former New York City mayor, who became a Democrat just last year, filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday to formally create a presidential campaign committee. The move legally allows him to begin raising and spending money on a 2020 campaign, although his team says he’s yet to make a final decision.
A formal announcement is expected in the coming days.
The 77-year-old Bloomberg is one of the richest people in the world. His estimated net worth exceeds $50 billion, and he’s already committed to spending more than $100 million to help defeat President Donald Trump in 2020 whether he runs or not.
Bloomberg’s enormous wealth, his ties to Wall Street, and his status as a former Republican could make it difficult for him to win support among traditional Democratic primary voters. Should he run, his advisers have charted an unconventional strategy that calls for him to bypass the first four states on the primary calendar and make an aggressive play for the so-called Super Tuesday states that vote in early March.
Before Thursday’s federal filing, he had already filed paperwork to qualify for presidential primary ballots in three states.
Bloomberg’s team says he’s stepping toward a run because of the perceived weakness at the top of the current Democratic field, particularly in establishment-favorite former Vice President Joe Biden’s candidacy.

Among a crowded stage of 10 Democrat candidates, it was President Trump who united them.

The former vice president raised eyebrows and drew some laughter with his answer to a question about domestic violence.

Impeachment Take Two: Bribery, Not Quid Pro Quo
""I think today's testimony is among the most significant evidence to date,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters. 
Schiff claimed this as a very important moment for the impeachment inquiry.
""It was the conditioning of official acts for something of great value to the president, these political investigations,"" Schiff said. ""It goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery as well as other potential high crimes and misdemeanors. But we also have heard for the first time that knowledge of this scheme was pervasive.
While Republicans flag this point made repeatedly by Sondland.
When asked if the President ever told him about any preconditions for the aid to be released, Sondland replied, ""No.""
Sondland claimed he thought a quid pro quo existed, but not in regards to holding up aid.
""As I testified previously, Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelenskiy.  Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election, DNC server and Burisma. 
Sondland then eventually presumed the hold on security assistance played a part as well.
""That was my presumption yes,"" he told the committee, while still making it clear he never got a presidential directive.
""My testimony is I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on announcement on elections,"" Sondland said. 
And he also recounted a phone call with President Trump – he asked point-blank what Trump wanted from Ukraine.
""He said nothing. 'I want no quid pro quo. I just want Zelensky to do what he ran on,'"" the ambassador testified. 
Much like Tuesday's witnesses Sondland also testified, at the time, he did not equate investigating Burisma with the Bidens.
""It was always Burisma to me and I didn't know about the connection to Burisma and Biden,"" he told the committee. 
Republicans also questioned if it was really that unusual to hold up foreign aid.
Rep. Devin Nunes, (R-CA) said, ""President Trump doesn't like foreign aid to start with."" 
""I've heard that, yes,"" Sondland replied.
""Before a president can send foreign aid, there has to be certification that there was no corruption,"" Nune said.  
""I'm aware of that now,"" the ambassador answered. 
While leaving the White House Wednesday afternoon, President Trump read directly from a transcript of the day's testimony. 
""He asks me screaming, 'What do you want from Ukraine?'"" Trump read. 
Sondland: ""It was a very short abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood.""
""I'm always in a good mood. I don't know what that is,"" the President said as he continued reading. 
Sondland: ""I keep hearing all these different ideas, theories and this and that – what do you want?""
""And now here is my response that he gave, just gave… ready, you have the cameras rolling. I want nothing, that's what I want from Ukraine. I want nothing, I said it twice,"" Trump said. 
As the President insisted again he did nothing wrong, he pushed back on Sondland's testimony.
""I don't know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. Seems like a nice guy though,"" Trump said. 
But Wednesday that nice guy threatened to crack the impeachment inquiry wide open. Trump disagreed, calling for people to ""read the transcript"" and insisting the phone call was ""perfect.""
Then he says the final word from the President of the United States. I want nothing. Thank you. folks. Have a good time,"" the President told the assembled members of the media. 
The White House also released a statement saying ""Democrats are chasing ghosts"" and that Sondland's testimony only reiterated that Trump ""wanted nothing"" from Ukraine. "

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who sponsored the bill, tweeted, ""#HongKong we hear you. We continue to stand with you.""
“The passage of this bill is an important step in holding accountable those Chinese and Hong Kong government officials responsible for Hong Kong’s eroding autonomy and human rights violations,” said Rubio.
Earlier, he also tweeted his opposition to a full-blown China takeover of Hong Kong saying, ""If govt of #HongKong passes new national security laws that allow #Beijing to prosecute critics, it would be the de facto end of ""One Country, Two Systems"", a violation of every promise made during the handover & warrants U.S. immediately treating city same as mainland #China.""
The Senate bill now goes to the House of Representatives which has already passed similar legislation.
The Senate vote came after months of protest, and it angered Beijing which has threatened to take what it calls ""strong countermeasures"" if Congress passes the bill. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang blasted the US bill saying it was designed to “bolster anti-China, extremist and violent radicals who attempt to disrupt Hong Kong (and) damage Hong Kong's prosperity and stability” as part of a plot to contain China’s development.
The measure mandates sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who carry out human rights abuses, and it requires an annual review of the favorable trade status Washington gives Hong Kong.

That places Buttigieg solidly in the front-running group with Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. He's tried to position himself as a moderate on some issues, in contrast to the far-left policies of Warren and Sanders.

Now, as Warren did, Buttigieg is likely to face tougher scrutiny from the other candidates, along with voters and the political media.
CBN News chief political analyst, David Brody, says there’s no doubt the attacks in tonight’s debate will be aimed at Buttigieg.
“He reminds me of Barack Obama back in 2007…from a cadence perspective, from a generational perspective, from an uplifting perspective and boy, he’s able to kind of weave a narrative…and he’s brought in faith, Barack Obama brought in faith as well, and he’s able to do it in this kind of progressive, compassionate Matthew 25 type of gospel that we’ve heard before,” Brody said on the CBN News Podcast ""The Daily Rundown"".

Day three of the public testimony might have been the most interesting yet with the public finally hearing from witnesses who were directly involved with the phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenksy.
One of the more notable revelations came when Republicans hinted multiple times during questioning of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, that they believe he might be a whistleblower source.

""I spoke to two individuals with regards to providing some sort of readout of the call,"" Vindman said.
Vindman testified one of them was George Kent, but when asked a question about the second person by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) about what agency the individual was from, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff (D-CA) intervened.
""If I could interject here. We don't want to use these proceedings. We need to protect the whistleblower,"" the California Democrat said. 
Democrat objections leading Republicans to this question.
""You have said you don't know who the whistleblower is, so how is this outing the whistleblower if you don't know who it is?,"" asked Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio)
Both Vindman and Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Pence, acknowledged concerns while listening to the July 25 telephone call. 
""What was your real-time reaction to hearing that call?"" Schiff asked.
""Chairman, Without hesitation, I knew I had to report this to the White House counsel,"" Vindman responded. ""It was my duty to report my concerns. It was inappropriate. It was improper for the President to demand an investigation into a political opponent.""
""I found the July 25 call unusual,"" Williams testified. 
Vindman testified, however, he didn't view moving the call to a secure server as ""anything nefarious."" 
""This is definitely not unprecedented,"" Vindman told the committee.
Both of the witnesses denied Trump's accusations they are ""never Trumpers.""
""It certainly surprised me,"" Williams said. ""I was not expected to be called out by name.""
""I'd call myself ""never partisan,"" Vindman said. 
Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) questioned Speaker Nancy Pelosi's claims that the House's investigation is about bribery.  
""The word bribery appears in these 3,500 pages one time. It appears in the description of Vice President Biden's conduct,"" the congressman said. 
""The reason we don't ask fact witnesses to make a judgment about whether a crime of bribery has been committed is, you're fact witnesses,"" Schiff responded. ""It will be our job to decide whether the impeachable act of bribery has occurred. That's why we don't ask you those questions.""
In the afternoon, Republicans finally got the chance to bring forth two witnesses of their own – Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison, both former administration officials. 
""In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating..""Burisma,"" as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different –the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable,"" Volker testified. 
Morrison and Volker both say they were never asked to bribe or extort anyone.
""I was never involved in anything I considered to be bribery at all or extortion,"" Morrison said. 
 
""Did anything concern you on the call?,"" GOP Counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison. 
Morrison simply replied, ""No.""
Meanwhile, President Trump said look the impeachment started even before he became commander-in-chief. On Tuesday, he pushed back on testimony that he did anything wrong.
Trump said he doesn't know Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a man who listened in on the infamous July 25 call.
""All these people are talking about they heard a conversation about a conversation of another conversation that was had by the president. What's going on is a disgrace and it's an embarrassment to our nation,"" Trump said. 
Trump has repeatedly called for people to ""read the transcript"" insisting the call was ""perfect.""
""If anybody reads the transcripts, I had two calls with the President of Ukraine, by the way, said that there was no pressure whatsoever,"" the President said.  
During the House's second week of public testimony, the President pushed policy form the Cabinet Room at the White House
""In the meantime, we can't get USMCA approved because Nancy Pelosi is grossly incompetent,"" he said.  
The President himself is now toying with testifying, considering accepting the speaker's invitation to submit written answers tweeting ""Even though I did nothing wrong? I like the idea & will strongly consider it!"

""The president could come right before the committee and speak all the truth that he wants if he wants to take the oath or he could do it in writing,"" Pelosi said. ""He has every opportunity to present his case.""

""If he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it,"" she said. Trump ""could come right before the committee and talk, speak all the truth that he wants if he wants.""
Trump has indicated he may be willing to testify at the impeachment hearing. On Monday, he tweeted he might offer written testimony: ""She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don't like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!""
Meanwhile, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) told Fox News the upcoming report from Inspector General Michael Horowitz on how the Russia collusion investigation got started could be bad news for many in Washington.
""The Democrats are racing to get through this impeachment as quickly as possible,"" Ratcliffe said. ""That's why we had eight witnesses in five hearings this week and we're not doing any of the work is because they know that that inspector general's report is likely to be damning about the origins of the 2016 investigation into the Trump campaign, and the role that the Obama-Biden officials played in that.""
Critics of the Russia investigation have argued it originated with a ""deep state"" attempt to undermine Trump that they believe was initiated under the Obama administration.
That report is expected to be released to the public soon.
Horowitz told Congress in a letter last month that he did not expect a lengthy review period and that he intended to make as much of the report public as possible, with minimal redactions.
""A number of people who were mentioned in the report are having an opportunity right now to comment on how they're quoted in the report,"" Attorney General William Barr said at a news conference in Memphis, Tennessee last week. ""And after that process is over, which should be very short, the report will be issued.""
Horowitz's team has reviewed over one million records and conducted more than 100 interviews, including several who were interviewed in the last few months, the inspector general has told Congress."

Buttigieg Takes Iowa Lead Amid Rumors on Bloomberg and Clinton,"There's a new front-runner among Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa, and it's just the latest sign that some in the party aren't too happy with their top candidate choices.
For months, former Vice President Joe Biden held the lead in Iowa, which is the first contest for Democrat candidates seeking their party's nomination. Now South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in first place in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll for the state.
Buttigieg has 25 percent and Elizabeth Warren is close behind at 22 percent. Biden has steadily slipped in the polls in recent weeks, even though he was once thought to be the most likely pick for the party, falling to 15 percent where he's now tied with socialist candidate Bernie Sanders.

Buttigieg's Anti-Christian Controversy
Buttigieg has been controversial for his extreme attacks on the Christian faith of Vice President Mike Pence. Earlier this year, Buttigieg, who is married to another man, compared Christians to Islamic extremists because of their biblical beliefs about sexuality.
But recently, he tried to appeal to Christian voters by claiming he'd do a better job of showing what real Christianity is like if he's sent to the White House.
Biden Aims for the Middle, Opposes Marijuana
Buttigieg may be surging in Iowa, but a new poll shows Biden holds a commanding lead in the South Carolina primary contest.
Biden has tried to position himself as the more moderate candidate. He just made headlines for explaining that he wouldn't support legalizing marijuana if he is elected president. 
""The truth of the matter is, there's not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,"" the Business Insider reports Biden saying.
""It's a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it,"" he added.
New Democrat Joins Presidential Race
Meanwhile, another Democrat just recently joined the 2020 presidential race. 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is a late-comer to the primary race but said, ""You can't know if you can break through unless you get out and try,"" CBS News reports.
Patrick, who is a close friend of former President Barack Obama, said in his announcement video, ""This won't be easy and it shouldn't be. But I'm placing my faith in the people who feel left out and left-back, who just want a fair shot at a better future. Not built by somebody better than you, not built for you, but built with you."" 
Despite saying that he ""respects the Democratic candidate,"" he appeared to condemn Biden and Warren when he said, ""We seem to be migrating on the one camp toward nostalgia...and on the other camp it's 'our big idea or no way.'""
No Breakaway Candidate - Field Open for Bloomberg?
With no breakaway candidate emerging after almost an entire year, some pundits say it's clear Democrats are unhappy with their field of candidates. That's why New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg is also rumored to be considering joining the race. 
The former New York City mayor has not formally announced his run for the presidency, but Jason Schechter, a spokesman for Bloomberg said, ""The only candidate Mike is trying to stop is Donald Trump.""
Bloomberg is already taking on Trump, pouring $100 million into an online advertising campaign attacking the president. The campaign will run in four battleground states: Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. One example of a new ad shows a picture of the president's Twitter page, with the caption ""a tweet shouldn't threaten our national security.""
Jumping into the political fray, Bloomberg apologized recently for defending NYPD's controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy. The policy allowed police to stop people on the street and frisk them if there was cause to believe a crime had been committed or was about to occur. 
Bloomberg acknowledged that the policy led to ""far too many innocent people"" being stopped - many were black and Latino. ""The erosion of that trust bothered me,"" Bloomberg said. ""And I want to earn it back. Today, I want you to know that I realize that I was wrong. And I'm sorry.
Then, There's Hillary - Will She Run?
Then there's Hillary Clinton who has said she's been strongly urged to join the race too.
According to the BBC, Clinton said that she would ""never say never,"" and that she is ""under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it.""
""I think all the time about what kind of president I would have been. Whoever wins next time is going to have a big task trying to fix everything that's been broken,"" she added. 
But there's still two and a half months until the Iowa caucuses which take place February 3."
0,2019-11-17T07:00:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/november/democrat-edwards-wins-reelection-in-conservative-louisiana,Democrat Edwards Wins Reelection in Conservative Louisiana,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Deep in the heart of the conservative South, Louisiana’s voters reelected Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards to a second term, shocking Republicans who had hoped to reclaim the seat on the strength of President Donald Trump’s popularity.
With his focus on bipartisan, state-specific issues, the moderate Edwards cobbled together enough cross-party support Saturday to defeat Republican businessman Eddie Rispone, getting about 51% of the vote.
Trump fought to return the seat to the GOP, but his intense interest in the race not only motivated conservative Republicans, but also powered a surge in anti-Trump and black voter turnout that helped boost Edwards over the finish line.
Coming after a defeat in the Kentucky governor’s race and sizable losses in Virginia’s legislative races, the Louisiana result seems certain to rattle Republicans heading into the 2020 presidential election. Trump made three trips to Louisiana to rally against Edwards, and fashioned the runoff election between Edwards and Rispone into a test of his own popularity and political prowess.
In a victory rally of his own late Saturday, Edwards thanked supporters who danced, sang and cheered in celebration, while he declared, “How sweet it is!”
He added, “And as for the president, God bless his heart” — a phrase often used by genteel Southerners to politely deprecate someone.
“Tonight the people of Louisiana have chosen to chart their own path,” Edwards said.
As he conceded the race, Rispone called on supporters to give a round of applause for Trump, saying: “That man loves America and he loves Louisiana.”
Democrats who argue that nominating a moderate presidential candidate is the best approach to beat Trump are certain to say Louisiana’s race bolsters their case.
Still, while Rispone’s loss raises questions about the strength of Trump’s coattails, its relevance to his reelection chances are less clear. Louisiana is expected to easily back Trump next year, and Edwards’ views are, in many ways, out of step with his own party.
A West Point graduate and former Army Ranger, Edwards opposes most gun restrictions, signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans and dismissed the impeachment effort as a distraction.
Meanwhile, Rispone, 70, wasn’t among the top-tier candidates Republican leaders hoped would challenge Edwards. He had ties to the unpopular former Gov. Bobby Jindal, started with little name recognition and offered few details about his agenda.
Edwards, 53, also proved to be a formidable candidate, with a record of achievements.
Working with the majority-Republican Legislature, Edwards stabilized state finances with a package of tax increases, ending the deficit-riddled years of Jindal. New money paid for investments in public colleges and the first statewide teacher raise in a decade.
Edwards expanded Louisiana’s Medicaid program, lowering the state’s uninsured rate below the national average. A bipartisan criminal sentencing law rewrite he championed ended Louisiana’s tenure as the nation’s top jailer.
Rispone, the owner of a Baton Rouge industrial contracting company, hitched his entire candidacy to Trump, introducing himself to voters in ads that focused on support for the president in a state Trump won by 20 percentage points. Rispone said he was like Trump, describing himself as a “conservative outsider” whose business acumen would help solve the state’s problems.
The president’s repeated visits appeared to drive turnout for both candidates.
Tour guide Andrea Hartman, 40, cast her ballot for Edwards in New Orleans.
“I do not agree with what Rispone advocates,” she said. “I also don’t want Trump coming here and telling me who to vote for.”
Rispone poured more than $12 million of his own money into the race. But he had trouble drawing some of the primary vote that went to Republican U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, after harshly attacking Abraham in ads as he sought to reach the runoff. He also avoided many traditional public events attended by Louisiana gubernatorial candidates and sidestepped questions about his plans. He promised tax cuts without saying where he’d shrink spending, and pledged a constitutional convention without detailing what he wanted to rewrite.
“We have nothing to be ashamed of. We had over 700,000 people in Louisiana who really want something better, something different,” Rispone said.

Case in point, Thursday night's rally in Louisiana.   
He told those attending, ""These crazed lunatics, the Democrats, the radical Left, and their media partners are pushing the deranged impeachment witch hunt…for (me) doing nothing wrong.  Doing nothing wrong.  You know, we did nothing wrong, and they're doing nothing.""
Trump predicted the process won't end well for the Democrats, saying, ""But once again, their lies will be exposed, just like the last times.""
 
The President let the crowd know all these attacks on him are hurting his family.
""Impeachment to me is a dirty word,"" he said. ""But it's been very unfair, very hard on my family.  Me…it's my whole life, it's crazy…what a life I lead!  You think this is fun, don't you?  But it's been very hard on my family.  Very, very hard.""
 
Adding to that pain, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi notched it up to a higher level, accusing the president of a crime the US Constitution calls impeachable.  
Pelosi said to reporters, ""We haven't even made a decision to impeach.  That's what the inquiry is about.   And when the committees decide that, they will decide what the articles (of impeachment) are.   But I am saying that what the president has admitted to and says it's perfect…I said it's perfectly wrong – it's bribery.""
Trump shot back at the speaker, tweeting ""Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who should be home cleaning up the dangerous & disgusting Slum she is making of her District in San Francisco, where even the filth pouring into the Pacific Ocean is rapidly becoming an environmental hazard, is getting NOTHING DONE.""  
Trump didn't let up Friday afternoon, when he expressed fury with Democrat-created rules that have limited what Republicans can do in the hearings.      
""I think it's considered a joke all over Washington and all over the world,"" he said. ""The Republicans are given no due process whatsoever.   We're not allowed to do anything. It's a disgrace what's happening.  But you know what?  The American public understands it. And that's why the poll numbers are so good.""
The President then blasted the news media's coverage of the impeachment process and his presidency, calling the press ""unbelievably dishonest.""
And he said that's why the mainstream media are seeing their lowest approval ratings in the history of the country.

While day one of public testimony was long and drawn out with little new information, there was revelation of another phone call.
US diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor and senior State Department official George Kent both testified that Trump ordered nearly $400 million in military aid withheld from Ukraine for political purposes.

Then came that revelation from Taylor. He said one of his staffers overheard EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland on the phone with Trump.
 
""The member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine,"" Taylor said in his opening statement. ""Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of the Bidens.""
Trump said he didn't remember the conversation.
""I know nothing about that. First time I've heard of it,"" he said in a news conference. ""The one thing I've seen that Sondland said is that he did speak to me for a brief moment and I said no quid pro quo under any circumstances. And that's true.""
On the Biden corruption front, Kent said he was concerned about the role of Hunter Biden, son of then Vice President Joe Biden, at a Ukrainian gas company.
""There was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,"" said Kent in an answer to a lawmaker.
In the hearing, Republicans focused on the end result, namely that the White House did release military aid to Ukraine and there was no investigation of the Bidens. They also noted that Taylor and Kent relied on secondhand information.
CBN's chief political analyst David Brody said one theme stuck out to him on Wednesday.
""One word – hearsay,"" he told CBN's Faith Nation. ""We heard it all the time. If we're going to play this game of telephone, I heard it from that person who heard it from that person, now we're into fourth hand. What in the world does that mean exactly?""
Taylor's staffer who says he heard that call will now testify privately on Friday. Marie Yavanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, will also take the stand – though publicly – that same day.

Cameras crowded the top US diplomats to Ukraine, who under oath revealed their previously disclosed testimony in public for the first time. 
Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said that ""what we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance.""
Thanking witnesses William Taylor, the US ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, Nunes said, ""I'd like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats' star chamber auditions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol.""
During the hearing, Ambassador Taylor added a new revelation to his previous testimony, adding that ""at the time I gave my first deposition on October 22 I was not aware of this information."" 
Taylor said a staffer at a restaurant with Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, heard President Trump speaking over the phone with Sondland.

Taylor said ""investigations"" was a term ""used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to investigations of Burisma and the Bidens.""
""I had come to understand well before then that investigations was a term ambassadors Kurt Volker and Sondland used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to investigations of Burisma and the Bidens,"" Taylor said.
Taylor described a visit to the frontline of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that came after President Trump's now-infamous July phone call with Zelensky.
""Russian-led forces continue to kill Ukrainians in the war one or two a week,"" said Taylor. 
An hour into the hearing the President retweeted a video from the official White House Twitter account that declared ""New hoax. Same swamp.""
""It's a witch hunt, it's a hoax,"" said President Trump in the Oval Office during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  
Dismissing the ongoing hearings, the President said, ""I'm too busy to watch it. I have not been briefed.""
On the Biden corruption front, Deputy Assistant Secretary George P. Kent said he was concerned over former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter's role at a Ukrainian gas company. 
""There was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,"" Kent said.  
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Taylor's own testimony made no linkage between US aid to Ukraine and any investigation. 
""There was discussion of the security assistance but no linkage,"" said Taylor.
For their part, Republicans pressed home their point that the testimony of the career service officers was not firsthand. 
""They could be wrong, or they could be mistaken, or they could have heard it incorrectly, right Ambassador Taylor?"" asked Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio).
""People make mistakes,"" said Taylor."

Newswatch is seen weekdays on the CBN News Channel.  For a programming schedule, click here. 
Despite the impeachment inquiry hearings going public on Wednesday, few political analysts believe the Democrats will be able to remove President Trump from office. 
Conservative radio host Todd Starnes says the effort will die in the Senate.

During an interview airing on CBN's Newswatch on Wednesday, Starnes reminded viewers the Democrats have been trying to impeach the President since the day after he got elected. 
""We document this,"" he said. ""It's all out there for public consumption. The Washington Post on the day of the inauguration actually had a column talking about how the impeachment of the President started right then and there. So this is not a big surprise here.""
""Look, it's going to get nasty between now and Election Day next November,"" Starnes noted. ""And I think the average American voter needs to understand this is all about politics. The President has done nothing wrong. If you actually read the transcripts, you understand that this guy is not a whistleblower, he is a leaker. And beyond that, this is a guy who has very close ties for the Obama administration.""
""So again, we're talking about deep state collusion to take down a duly elected President of these great United States,"" he continued. 
CBN News asked Starnes if he thought Republicans would stand with the President. 
""I have no doubt Sen. Lindsey Graham will hold the line in the Senate. No doubt about that,"" the radio host replied. ""I have no doubt the House Freedom Caucus will hold ground in the House of Representatives.""
""Do I think this President will be convicted?"" Starnes asked. ""I don't believe so. I don't see any kind of a game plan or movement where a majority of Republicans in the Senate would join the Democrats to convict the President. So this is all about embarrassing the President. This is about besmirching his good name. Every American is going to see what the Democrats are trying to do here.""
When asked about another Democrats' strategy, possible going after Trump's fitness to serve, Starnes laughed about the Democrats' new scheme.
""Here's the new scheme,"" he said chuckling. ""They want the American people to think he's looney. He's crazy. He's off his rocker. As we say back home in Tennessee, 'The front porch lights on, but nobody's home'.""  
""Look, come on. This is outrageous,"" Starnes added. ""The average American voter understands this President has all of his mental faculties about him.  Here's something for all of the viewers to consider.  Over the weekend, President Trump was at the LSU-Alabama football game. The massive applause and cheers that this president received. Now had there been boos, there would have been wall-to-wall national news coverage. But because you had more than 100,000 people cheering this president, the mainstream media ignored it, because it goes against their narrative that the American people are wary or maybe they don't like this president or his agenda or his tweets."" 
""I don't believe that's the case,"" the radio host continued. ""And I believe what we saw happen in Alabama at that football game is representative of the general feeling of the American people at large."""

She's not just any woman. She's a survivor of Romanian communism. In fact, she was almost assassinated for standing against it.
CBN News recently spoke to religious freedom advocate Virginia Prodan, author of Saving My Assassin, who narrowly escaped death after Romania's dictator Nicolae Ceausescu sent an assassin to kill her when she took his regime to court for persecuting Christians. 
With a gun pointed at her head, five-foot-tall Virginia led her would-be assassin to Christ and is now sharing her story, and warning Americans about the dangers of socialism.

Prodan explains that the Romanian government at that time wanted her dead because she defended Christian and human rights cases.
""The socialist government will establish a system where the government is your God, not Christ. It will have everything appointed to Christians to persecute them,"" she explains. ""What I did is defend Christians who had a Bible in their home or shared the Bible with others.""
Prodan says she's been shocked to hear liberal American politicians promoting socialism in recent years.
""I wonder, 'Am I dreaming, am I back in Romania?' It's impossible. It's not America. It's the same type of lies that I heard my parents were told in order to give them the vote for the socialists to be in power,"" she recalls.
Her message to millennials who favor socialism is to work hard for themselves, not expecting the government to be supportive in everything.
""They want to believe that socialists will resolve their problems. They were told that the American dream is available to everyone. I believe it's available to everyone who works hard, who does everything on their part,"" she says. 
""They got into the lies that the government can subsidize you. When the government gives you something, they will take your freedom. Read about how the government in Romania established the way you live and how I was allowed to go to law school and work, it's not like America,"" she explains.
Prodan says the younger generation wants to make a change to America, but she advises caution.
""Make sure you are not the only generation in the history of the United States that will make a very painful, worse change for America,"" Prodan concludes.

The televised testimonies of two witnesses are taking place while Republicans attempt to have their own witnesses come forward. 
The ""he said, she said"" elements central to this impeachment inquiry can be hard to follow and both sides are adding more fuel to the fire. Democrats released new transcripts from closed-door proceedings only hours before the new hearings. The president's allies' main contention remains that the evidence does not add up to impeachment. 
The new transcripts are from October 23, the day Republicans dramatically stormed into a closed-door hearing when the Pentagon official in charge of Ukraine testified the president directed aid to Ukraine be frozen while he asked the country to investigate its internal corruption.
""There was no investigation and the aid flowed as it was supposed to,"" former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley says, maintaining that even if the president tried to pursue a quid pro quo – it didn't happen. 
MY FAITH VOTES Calls for Prayer: Impeachment Process and Christians Call to Prayer Guide
Meanwhile, the impeachment hearings are now on full public display, broadcast live on networks, cable channels and the internet. 
First up – acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor who texted Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, that it would be ""crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""
Then comes diplomat George Kent who said behind closed doors that the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani ran a ""campaign of slander"" and ""lies"" to oust former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.  
Later in the week, the House hears from Fiona Hill, the former national security council official who said in her testimony that former National Security Advisor John Bolton was so distraught over a July 10th White House meeting with Ukrainian officials that he abruptly ended a meeting in his office. 
The public proceedings come after acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney admitted and then denied a ""quid pro quo,"" saying it wasn't anything unusual. ""We do that all the time with foreign policy,"" he said. 
Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) defends Trump saying, ""The president asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival."" Kennedy said Sunday President Trump's desire to withhold aid could be lawful. 
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) agrees, saying, ""Foreign aid by law can only go out to countries that are not corrupt."" 
Paul echoed that assessment, adding that Republicans should be allowed to bring witnesses of their own to the circus. 
""If you can't call Hunter Biden and if you can't call the whistleblower, that's not, that's sort of a sham, that's not even really a trial,"" Paul continued. 
A big fish for Democrats in the impeachment inquiry is Mick Mulvaney. But Tuesday he said he would not comply with a subpoena. "

When CBN News first met 24-year-old Devinn Smart outside the White House, one thing became perfectly clear. ""I believe that President Donald Trump is going to win 2020 by a landslide,"" he told us. 
His view wasn't always this way. Hardly. He grew up in a family of die-hard Democrats and attended a historically black university in Hampton, Virginia.

'Great Discussion and Celebration': Faith Leaders Pray for Trump at White House
While at college, Devinn started researching Trump for himself and a specific line resonated with him when the candidate was making his appeal to black voters. ""What the h*** do you have to lose?"" Trump exclaimed back then. Devinn was listening intently. ""I was just looking at his policies and the things that he said he was going to do and I said, 'Ok, I'm starting to like this guy'… but I was scared to say it out loud because I know I was going to get judged."" 
While he didn't vote in 2016, soon after Trump became president, Devinn ""outed"" himself on Twitter as a full-fledged Trump supporter, complete with a ""Make America Great Again"" hat. 
""The Democratic Party has been manipulating the black community for over fifty years and I was simply tired of it,"" Devinn tells CBN News. 
The insults came quickly. ""I've been called a coon, a bootlicker, an 'Uncle Tom'… all of these derogatory terms all because I support the president.""
More fallout was on the way. Twice he's been asked to preach at spiritual revival conferences in Virginia. And twice he's been disinvited. 
""The pastor called me and said, unless you go on your Twitter and say that you do not support the president, I can not invite you here,"" Smart told CBN News. ""I said, 'Tell me where in the Bible does it say that I can not preach at your church because I support the president?' He said, 'Well, there are a lot of people at my church who don't support the president and they would be very upset with me if you come so I have to take away your invitation'."" 
Devinn says that made no sense from a spiritual perspective. ""My job, when I'm standing behind that sacred desk is to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  And for you to tell me I can't come and preach at, not your church but the Lord's church, because I support the president? Now, are you living by the principles of the Bible? That was my question.""
The pastor abruptly hung up the phone, but Devinn still remains dialed in for Trump. He says he's not been disappointed: A historically low unemployment rate for African-Americans, a groundbreaking prison reform law, and allocating a record amount of federal money to historically black colleges. 
Those achievements may be paying political dividends. In 2016, Trump won eight percent of the black vote. A new poll shows him with almost double that now at 15 percent. 
Devinn came to the White House in October as part of the Black Leadership Summit. As a Christian, he experienced something pretty cool. It started when talking to a friend before the event. ""She said, 'I would love to pray at the White House.' So at the end (of the event), me and her both said, 'Hey President Trump, can we pray?' And he pointed at me and said come up and pray but she had just told me that she had a dream about praying at the White House. I looked at her and said, 'Go ahead'."" She went up on stage and prayed – a prayer that has since gone viral. 
As for Devinn's journey, he's been through a lot for publicly supporting the president. He tells me many more like him are still out there but they operate in stealth mode.  
""I had over 100 messages on my Twitter of people saying, 'Devinn, I support the president but I'm not as strong as you to come out and say it in public.' …I have a lot of people who support President Donald Trump but they won't say it. It's secret. They're going to vote for him in 2020. I'm telling you they are."" The Trump Campaign is sure hoping Devinn Smart is, ""brilliant"" in his prediction.  "

Peter King Retiring, Giving Dems New 2020 Target","WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Peter King, a moderate Republican who has represented a Long Island congressional district for nearly 30 years, announced Monday he won't seek reelection, presenting Democrats with a fresh suburban target as they defend their majority in 2020.
The decision comes days after voters flocked to Democratic candidates in state elections in Kentucky and Virginia, underscoring Republican vulnerability in a suburban revolt against President Donald Trump.
But in the latest indication that congressional Republicans are rallying behind Trump for now, King said he will oppose Democratic efforts to impeach Trump. King also opposed Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998.
""In the coming weeks and during the next year I intend to vote against President Trump's impeachment and will support the President's bid for re-election,"" King said.
The 14-term congressman, 75, said in a Facebook post that he's retiring because he wants ""flexibility to spend more time"" with his children and grandchildren ""after 28 years of spending 4 days a week in Washington, D.C.""
King, a former chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, has cultivated a reputation for bipartisanship while maintaining a hard line on immigration and crime. He is the longest-serving Republican member of New York's congressional delegation. Still, he won reelection in 2018 by just 6 percentage points.
King's keen political instincts and deserved reputation as a fighter for New York's interests gave him remarkable political resiliency; at one point, after the 2008 election that sent Barack Obama to the White House, he was the state's lone GOP member of Congress.
He teamed up with powerful Democrats such as Chuck Schumer to win a huge Superstorm Sandy aid package after the 2012 storm, despite foot-dragging by GOP leaders. On Monday, the Senate Democratic leader took to Twitter to lavish praise on King.
""Peter King stood head & shoulders above everyone else,"" Schumer wrote. ""He's fiercely loved America, Long Island, and his Irish heritage and left a lasting mark on all 3.""
His district includes once-reliably GOP territory in southwestern Suffolk County and a portion of Nassau County, about an hour's drive east of Manhattan. It went narrowly for Trump in 2016.
Democrats seem certain to target the district in 2020. Many suburban districts around the country have been moving steadily toward Democrats as moderate, well-educated voters swing away from the polarizing president.
Twenty House Republicans have announced they will not seek reelection. Three other GOP lawmakers have resigned and already left Congress.
House Democrats retook the majority in 2018, and are looking to defend their majority and grab new seats in suburban districts in what they see as a backlash against Trump.
Only a handful of the Republican-held districts being vacated by retirements are expected to be seriously competitive next year. But King's district will be one of them, underscoring GOP vulnerability in suburban areas, spotlighted last week as suburban voters in Virginia and Kentucky flocked to Democratic candidates in elections for state offices.

Haley alleges in her new memoir that two former Trump administration officials, who were ultimately pushed out by President Trump, tried to get her to join their revolt against his policies.
In her book, she writes that the two told her they weren't being insubordinate, but they claimed ""it was their decisions, not the president's that were in the best interests of the country."" Haley says then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly were following a ""dangerous path.""
She told CBS, ""Instead of saying that to me, they should have been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan. It should have been, go tell the president what your differences are and quit if you don't like what he's doing.""
Kelly responded to the book, saying that what Haley terms resistance, he saw as developing a process to give the president enough information to make an informed decision.
And, as the Democrats are taking their impeachment hearings public this week, Haley also says she doesn't believe they'll succeed.
""No, on what? You're going to impeach the president for asking for a favor that didn't happen and giving money and it wasn't withheld? I don't know what you would impeach him on,"" Haley told CBS. ""Impeachment is like the death penalty for a public official. When you look at that transcript, there's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president.""
The televised hearings begin Wednesday. Expected to appear first: William Taylor, a former diplomat to Ukraine, who testified earlier that millions in military aid would be withheld unless there was an investigation into the president's political rival.
Democrats have shut down Republican requests to hear from former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden who was hired and paid millions by a Ukrainian energy company in what some suspect was a quid pro quo with the Obama White House.

One year ago, the 47-year-old abruptly announced her resignation as US ambassador to the United Nations. She offered no reason for leaving but called her time at the UN a ""blessing.""
Haley has dismissed actions by House Democrats to impeach Trump after they claime he pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden.

""The Ukrainians never did the investigation and the president released the funds. I mean, when you look at those, there's just nothing impeachable there,"" she said. ""And more than that, I think the — the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why do we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?""
""You're going to impeach a president for asking for a favor that didn't happen and — and giving money and it wasn't withheld?"" Haley said. ""I don't know what you would impeach him on. Impeachment is, like, the death penalty for a public official.""
The White House released the transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president in an effort to provide transparency as House Democrats accused Trump of committing a crime worthy of impeachment.
""When you look at the transcript, there's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president,"" Haley adds.
Also, Haley writes in a new her book, With All Due Respect, that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly tried to sabotage Trump in order to ""save the country,"" according to CNBC.
""Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country.""
""It was their decisions, not the president's, that were in the best interests of America, they said. The president didn't know what he was doing,"" Haley wrote about the two advisers.
In her book, Haley mentioned that advisors have an obligation to carry out the president's agenda —  and if they strongly disagree then they should leave.
""To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing. And it goes against the Constitution, and it goes against what the American people want. And it was offensive,"" she added."

The surprise call came three months before the infamous July 25 conversation that sparked the impeachment inquiry.
""Now they want my first call with the president of Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""If they want it I will probably give it to them but I don't like doing it because it sets a bad precedent.""
This announcement came as Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney ignored subpoenas to appear on Capitol Hill Friday.
""I don't want to give credibility to a corrupt witch hunt,"" Trump said. ""I'd love to have Mick go up. Frankly, I think he would do great.""
As he left for a trip to Georgia, the President dismissed any significance of testimony that has been released thus far.
Regardless, Democrats are preparing for their first publicly-televised impeachment hearing.
""We are very much looking forward to these witnesses next week raising the right hands going under oath and telling the American people about this shakedown scheme,"" said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA).
Three diplomats who've already testified behind closed doors were invited to go public.
Bill Taylor, George Kent, and Marie Yovanovitch will likely be asked to discuss their understanding of events before and after that July 25 call.
Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, testified before the panel on Wednesday.  Williams was one of the people listening to the call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.  Her testimony stretched out over four hours. 
Meanwhile, Pence spoke in New Jersey and said it's clear Trump did nothing wrong. 
""You know the American people have the transcript of the President's call and they can see there was no quid pro quo and the president did nothing wrong,"" the vice president said.  ""The President's focus has been, as my focus was with my meetings with President Zelensky to support President Zelensky's efforts to deal with a historic pattern of corruption in Ukraine."""

That's the big question many prominent Democrats are asking. Former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg isn't convinced they can and he's opening the door for his own shot.
The left-leaning billionaire has had quite a political journey over the years. ""I've been a Democrat. I've been a Republican and I eventually became an independent,"" Bloomberg said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention where he spoke in support of Hillary Clinton.
For weeks, the 77-year-old has been talking with influential Democrats expressing concerns about the steadiness of Joe Biden's campaign and the rise of left-wing Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
A long-time critic of President Trump, now Bloomberg is taking steps to get his name on the Alabama primary ballot which has a deadline of today.
Howard Wolfson, a top adviser for Bloomberg says the former mayor considers the president an ""unprecedented threat to our nation"" and says, ""Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well-positioned"" to defeat Trump.
""Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice and we can't afford to make that choice,"" Bloomberg said during his 2016 DNC speech.
He has experience running the largest city in America and has dedicated his influence and some of his fortune to promoting gun control laws and climate change initiatives.

As a moderate he would pose a threat to Biden, but his deep ties to Wall Street could motivate loyal supporters of Warren and Sanders who likely wouldn't take well to a billionaire blocking their agenda. 
He would also face an uphill battle winning over the party's powerful black constituency after defending the New York City Police Department's controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy which has been criticized as unfairly targeting African Americans and Hispanics.
Still, as Biden falls in the polls, some Democratic leaders and independent analysts think Warren and Sanders are too liberal to beat the president.
Bloomberg's step towards entering the race comes as polling shows the president remains very strong in key swing states needed to win the electoral college. "

Trump and Duck Dynasty's Phil and Willie Robertson Campaign in Louisiana,"President Donald Trump hit the campaign trail again Wednesday night, traveling to Monroe, Louisiana to support Republican businessman Eddie Rispone's effort to unseat the Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards.
This Louisiana runoff election for the governorship is being seen as a chance for Republicans to score a victory against Democrats in the Deep South after this week's GOP losses in Virginia.
""You're going out to replace a radical, liberal Democrat as your governor,"" Trump said.
He also took on other subjects including Joe Biden and trade with China. And referring to constant attacks against him, like the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, he continued, ""The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, smears, slanders and scams.""
""The Democrats' shameful conduct has created an angry majority, and that's what we are, we're a majority - and we're angry - that will vote the 'do nothing Democrats' out of office in 2020, especially, we're going to take back the House. And we're going to focus on those 36 Democrats in Trump areas, areas that I won by a lot. I didn't run in 2018, you know they keep forgetting,"" Trump said.
The president also introduced two of the state's famous reality TV stars: Phil and Willie Robertson of Duck Dynasty.
Phil Robertson told the crowd, ""I got it down to this. If you're pro-God and pro-America and pro-gun and pro-duck hunting, that's all I want.""
Willie Robertson chimed in, """"Well, I don't know what else to say after following Phil and the president and Eddie, but thank you guys so much. You have been such a great community to share life with... to worship with. And I'm so tickled to be here with the president that he actually came down to our community. And let's go, Eddie!""
The president will return to Louisiana next Thursday to again campaign for the Republican governor candidate two days before the election takes place.

The hearings kick off Wednesday, and while all three witnesses have already talked to investigators, this will be the first time the American public hears from them firsthand.
Bill Taylor, the Acting US Ambassador to Ukraine, will be the first to take the stand. He told investigators that Trump withheld millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. Taylor's transcript also reveals he sent a cable to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo but got no response.
""The most important facts are largely not contested,"" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters Wednesday.
President Trump shot back later that night at a campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana. ""Democrats must be accountable for their hoaxes and for their crimes,"" he said. ""Really, do you believe what is going on in Washington with these do-nothing, somewhat evil, in some cases very evil, people?""
Also testifying next week are Marie Yovanovitch, the former Ukrainian ambassador, and George Kent, a top State Department official.
Trump's defenders say none of this rises to the level of impeachment. ""There are perfectly appropriate quid pro quos and there are inappropriate quid pro quos,"" explained Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA)
Along those lines, supporters say Trump withheld aid from Ukraine while he was working to ensure that the government receiving the aid wasn't marred by corruption. CBN Founder Pat Robertson said on Thursday's 700 Club there's clearly nothing wrong with trying to make sure US aid isn't being given to a corrupt government.
This all comes as a new book written by an ""anonymous"" White House aide is set to come out. The Huffington Post reports the book claims White House officials made a list of Cabinet secretaries who would support using the 25th Amendment to remove the President in the days after he fired former FBI Director James Comey. These officials also believed Vice President Pence would back it up, a claim Pence's office refuted, calling it ""fake news.""
The White House is dismissing the hearings. At the same time though, it's beefing up its defense by hiring two longtime Trump allies to help with strategy.
Meanwhile, a majority of Americans think President Trump will win back the White House come 2020. That's according to a new Politico-Morning Consult survey.
It finds 56 percent of voters expect the president will be re-elected next year. If you break it down by political affiliation, 85 percent of Republicans think Trump will remain in office. A slight majority of independents - 51 percent - feel the same. Even a third of Democrats - 35 percent - think the president will be re-elected.

Of the 179 positions on the circuit court, 43 are occupied by President Trump's nominees. Four seats are currently open with five more expected to become vacant soon. 
In comparison, President Obama nominated 55 circuit judges during his entire 8 years in office.
""Percentage wise you'll never beat one man and you know who that is, George Washington, 100%,"" said Trump. ""But in terms of, I would like to say quality and quantity, we are going to be just about number one by the time we finish.""
But confirming these nominees hasn't always been easy. 
Democrats and liberal groups have ramped up their opposition against conservatives, like Amy Coney Barrett who was criticized for her Catholic faith.
And most recently, Lawrence VanDyke was accused by the ABA of bias against LGBTQ people.
""He's done work for groups like Alliance for Defending Freedom and that flags him as oh you must be someone who will be unfair for example to LGBT litigants before him which he said they unfairly said that he wouldn't say he would be fair to all litigants and that's not true,"" Judicial Crisis Network Carrie Severino said. ""(VanDyke said), 'I believe everyone is made in the image and likeness of God and they need to be treated equally'.""
Severino was in the East Room during what she calls an ""exciting milestone for the president,"" pointing out that it's not just the Supreme Court that makes historic rulings.
""People don't realize more than 99% of cases end at the appellate courts, they don't get to the Supreme Court,"" said Severino.

Trump has also placed two of the nine seats on the US Supreme Court. A move Republican lawmakers say will define his time in office.
""The defining moment of your presidency for me was the Kavanaugh hearing,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). ""This room would be empty if we had failed Brett Kavanaugh.""
The Senate is close to confirming Trump's 44th Appeals Court Judge. 
President Trump said within two months he expects 182 federal judges to have been approved.

He'll return to the political stage a year to the day after resigning as Trump's first attorney general at the president's request.
The 72-year-old Sessions had been one of the president's earliest supporters back when he was a senator from Alabama, which led the president to give him a top post in his administration. But their relationship soured because Sessions recused himself from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
Sessions was a longtime Republican senator from Alabama, but his departure had left the seat open for a Democrat challenger who managed to win the seat.
Now that Sessions is returning to fight for the senator post, his entry upends the primary race. It has a crowded field of challengers hoping to take on Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. The primary will take place on March 3.
One source told The Hill that Sessions plans to forcefully support Trump's agenda and denounce Democrats' impeachment efforts.
Even though Trump had publicly attacked Sessions in the past, Sessions has stayed loyal to Trump. In a speech last month at a Republican fundraiser in Huntsville, Sessions confirmed his support for Trump.
“That’s why I supported him and why I still do support him,” Sessions told the crowd of about 500. “He is relentlessly and actually honoring the promises he made to the American people.”
If Sessions does indeed jump into the race, he will face off against former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville; Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill; former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore; and others.
“When President Trump took on Washington, only one Senator out of a hundred had the courage to stand with him: me. I was the first to support President Trump. I was his strongest advocate. I still am. We must make America great again,"" Sessions said in a statement posted to his website. "

President Trump is touting his achievements in confirming judicial nominees.
In a short ceremony held in the East Room of the White House Wednesday, Trump announced his administration and Republicans in Congress have reached the milestone of confirming more than 150 federal judges.
""We should have within a short period of time, like two months, we should have about 182 federal judges,"" the President said as the audience applauded its appreciation.  
President Trump is closing in on filling up a quarter of the benches on federal appellate courts in just under three years in office.

President Barack Obama nominated 55 circuit judges who were confirmed over eight years.
""And as I say often, percentage-wise, you'll never beat one man and we all know who that is -- George Washington, 100 percent,"" Trump joked. 
""But in terms of I'd like to say quality and quality, I think we are going to be just about number 1 by the time we finish.  Number one of any president or any administration, so I want to thank all of you for the incredible job you've,"" the President said referring to all of his Republican colleagues in the room. 
""And they (the judges) will uphold our Constitution as written,"" Trump said. ""These distinguished men and women are some of the most gifted scholars, respected jurists, and the finest legal minds ever placed on the federal bench. Together we're restoring American freedom, defending American justice, and preserving the extraordinary vision of our founding fathers."" 
While a number of Trump's nominees are filling seats previously held by judges that were appointed by Republican presidents, a number are taking the place of liberal judges appointed by Democrats.
Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network attended Wednesday's ceremony. 
""This is a historic milestone for President Trump and the country both in terms of the number of circuit court judges appointed and their exceptional qualifications and independence,"" she said in a statement. ""President Trump has kept his promise to the American people.""

It's a big deal in many ways, but partly because Virginia's Democrats pushed this year for an extreme pro-abortion bill that would allow abortion up to the moment of birth. The only thing that stopped them was the slim majority held by Republican lawmakers. More about their expected liberal agenda in a moment.
But first, national Democrats are celebrating the win after liberal billionaires pumped millions of dollars into the state in hopes of turning the vote into some sort of referendum on President Trump.

Virginia's Democrat Governor Accused of Supporting 'Infanticide', Would Let Babies Die Right After They're Born
Virginia's Elections Are a Really Big Deal: Why Liberal Billionaires Like Soros Flooded the State with Cash
Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted about the Democrats' big wins. ""Tonight, by voting in Democratic majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, Virginians sent a clear, powerful message that will resonate across this nation and shake the walls of the White House."" 
While Democrats claim Virginia's election results are bad news for President Trump, CBN News Chief Political Analyst David Brody points out Trump lost Virginia in 2016, but still won the presidency.
""Hillary Clinton won Virginia in 2016 and how did it work out for her,"" Brody said during an interview with the CBN News show Faith Nation.  ""Donald Trump is not on the ballot so as much as Democrats are making a big deal, but when he's on the ticket - it makes a big difference.""
Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway is also brushing off the blue wave talk, saying, ""It's been trending blue for quite a while now.""
Suburban voters turned out in high numbers, particularly in the Washington, DC area. 
Polling showed that gun control was a major issue after a shooter killed 12 people in Virginia Beach in May.
""We ran on a very definite message, and that was we believe in conservative values,"" said incumbent House Speaker Kirk Cox (R).  Cox defeated his Democrat challenger Sheila Bynum-Coleman.
Democrat special interest groups poured money into the state in the final days. One week before election day more than $82 million had been spent making this the most expensive election in Virginia history. 
After the election, House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R), who won his race, issued a warning.
""Make no mistake: radical liberals from out of our Commonwealth will soon demand a return on tens of millions they invested to elect a far-left Democratic majority,"" he said. ""Virginians should expect public policies that look a lot more like the train-wreck that is California than the Virginia of good fiscal management and common-sense conservative governance.""
The agenda of Virginia Democrats includes stricter gun control laws, raising the minimum wage and more liberal abortion laws.
It also includes ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the US Constitution. Virginia is the final state needed for possible passage of the gender equality measure. As CBN News reported this year, many view the ERA as a Trojan horse for enshrining taxpayer-funded abortion in the Constitution.
While Gilbert promises the GOP will fight the agenda, the Democrats have the upper hand for the first time in decades.
""The voters like the process that we as Democrats have made over the past few years and they want us to continue that progress over the next few years and beyond,"" said Virginia's Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam. But the results weren't necessarily due to any popularity from Northam who had roiled the state in a blackface controversy and had publicly endorsed what many consider to be infanticide earlier in the year.

Meanwhile, in Kentucky Democratic challenger Andy Beshear declared victory in the governor's race over Republican incumbent Matt Bevin. The GOP governor is reportedly trailing by roughly 5,000 votes and is not conceding the race. President Trump campaigned for Bevin a day before the election, in a state that he won big in 2016. But Bevin came into the race with plenty of baggage after clashing with Kentucky teachers in a controversial way, and other Republicans in the state fared better than he did in this election. It's not clear if Bevin and Beshear will face a recount.
""There have been more than a few irregularities,"" Bevin says. Left with few options, Bevin could now carry Kentucky into a drawn-out legal battle contesting the results. 
The Trump administration is positioning Beshear's slim margin as a win – not a warning sign. ""The president made that governor's race competitive,"" Conway says.
Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff told CBN News the Democrats' strategy is set to backfire. ""Democrats will focus on the governor's race and if they use that to pursue additional endless investigations and justification that what they're doing in Washington, DC is working, I think that's going to hurt them a lot in 2020,"" he says."

Voters in Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, New Jersey and Virginia are making their choices for state and local offices. Virginia has been a reliable Republican state for fifty years, but is now leaning blue.
Donald Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton by five percent in 2016. The state assembly is almost evenly split. Republicans only hold a one seat majority in both the House and the Senate.

BELOW: Big Stakes in Election Day on Tuesday, What Will It Tell Us About 2020?
One week before Election Day more than $82 million had been spent making this the most expensive election in Virginia history.
And perhaps more than a bellwether, this vote could test Democrat voter enthusiasm following a black-face scandal for Gov. Ralph Northam, and sexual assault allegations against Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax.
""I think it's a sign of enthusiasm and how much voters are fired up and ready to get out there and I think Democrats are trying to go down ballot. We saw efforts in Wisconsin in the mid-terms and they're really hoping to make some gains in the state legislatures,"" said Caitlin Conant, political director for CBS News.
Gun control and healthcare are the top issues for Virginia Democrats.
""Republicans just don't do healthcare. This has never been one of their strong suits and it's a real and decades-long problem. It's one of the reasons we got the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is because Republicans have paid insufficient attention to this issue,"" explained the Cato Institute's Michael Cannon. 
A large turnout of pro-life voters may make a difference to keep red or purple states from turning blue. 
Many Virginians were outraged when Democrat Gov. Northam appeared on the radio advocating infanticide. 
Vice President Mike Pence raised the abortion issue at get-out-the-vote rallies in Virginia and Kentucky.  
""At a time when leading Democrats advocate late-term abortion and defend infanticide, I promise you this president, this vice president and your governor will always stand for the right to life,"" Pence insisted in Kentucky where Gov. Matt Bevin describes himself as America's ""most pro-life governor"".
The vice president and president will be watching the Virginia race closely. It's a key southern state. What happens there could make a big difference not only for Virginians, but for Donald Trump's re-election chances in 2020. "

Warren has come under fire from fellow Democrats along with Republicans and many economists over her high-priced government health care plan. 
Meanwhile, it has been said, ""politics makes strange bedfellows."" That all-too-common saying during election season was at play again Sunday night as socialist candidate Sanders received Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-Minn) endorsement.
Omar appeared with Sanders at a rally at the University of Minnesota and spoke on his behalf. 
She claimed there must be a ""movement of working-class"" that must be built for Sanders to win the White House next year.
""Here's the cold truth: We can't achieve any of these goals if we don't build a movement that is representative of all of our aspirations, all of our pain, and all of our shared trauma,"" Omar said. ""That is why we must build a mass movement of the working class that transcends faith, age, gender, and background.""
Omar also said President Sanders will ""fight against western imperialism and fight for a just world.""  
""I am proud to stand with the son of a Jewish refugee who survived genocide,"" Omar said, referring to Sanders. ""The acknowledgment of pain and suffering is personal for both of us. The fight for human rights is undeniable. And when we recognize injustices of the past and present, whether it is genocide against Jewish people, Armenians or Rwandans or Bosnians or Native Americans or more,"" she continued.
Sanders didn't appear bothered by Omar's past anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements, unlike many of his colleagues in Congress. She supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel and has repeatedly criticized the government of America's top democratic-ally in the Middle East. 
Sanders has also criticized the Jewish state during his campaign. Just last week, he said he would cut US aid to Israel and give the money to Palestinians in Gaza. 
When it was his turn at the microphone, Sanders thanked Omar by name.
""Thank you, Ilhan Omar,"" he said.
""People say that Ilhan and I make an odd political couple. But in fact, there is really nothing odd about it at all,"" he continued. ""Ilhan and I share a common link as the descendants of families who fled violence and poverty, and who came to this country as immigrants. But that is not just my story or Ilhan's story -- that is the story of America.""
Sanders also said he and Omar both were working to eliminate ""all student debt in America,"" and make all public colleges ""tuition-free.""
Omar's fellow Democrat progressives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Talib have also endorsed Sanders.
The poll also found concerns among Democrat voters about Sanders' health.  More than 4 in 10 Democrats believe he's not in good enough health to serve as president, according to The Post. "
0,2019-11-01T17:45:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/november/beto-orourke-announces-hes-dropping-2020-presidential-bid,Beto O'Rourke Announces He's Dropping 2020 Presidential Bid,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman, announced Friday that he was ending his Democratic presidential campaign, which failed to recapture the enthusiasm, interest and fundraising prowess of his 2018 Senate race.
In an online post, O’Rourke said, “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.” He planned to address supporters later Friday at an event in Iowa.
O’Rourke was urged to run for president by many Democrats, including supporters of former President Barack Obama, who were energized by his narrow Senate loss last year in Texas, a reliably Republican state. He raised a record $80 million from donors across the country, visited every county in Texas and used social media and live streaming video to engage directly with voters. He ultimately lost to incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz by 3 percentage points.
But O’Rourke, 47, struggled to replicate that model in the presidential primary, and both his polling and his fundraising dwindled significantly in recent months.
“Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” he wrote on Medium. “Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country.”
O’Rourke’s decision comes as the Democratic primary enters a critical stretch. With three months until the kickoff Iowa caucuses, polls consistently show a trio of candidates leading the way: former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, showing strength in Iowa, as well. Lower polling candidates face difficult questions about whether they have the money to sustain a campaign through the first primary contests.
Earlier this week, Kamala Harris, another candidate who entered the race to much fanfare, announced she was downscaling her campaign, laying off some staffers and reorienting almost exclusively to focus on Iowa.
O’Rourke entered the race as the feel-good, dynamic candidate who had the ability to appeal to both Republicans and Democrats and work across the aisle in Washington. But he immediately faced criticism that he had a sense of entitlement, particularly after the release of a Vanity Fair interview on the eve of his campaign launch in which he appeared to say he was “born” to be in presidential politics.
After quickly pulling in $9.4 million during his first two weeks in the race, O’Rourke’s financial situation deteriorated. By the end of June, he was spending more than his campaign was taking in. By the end of September, he had just $3.2 million cash on hand while spending double that over the previous three months, campaign finance records show.
Perhaps more significantly, the small-dollar contributions that fueled his Senate bid and the early days of his presidential campaign slowed to a $1.9 million trickle.
The former congressman also struggled to articulate a consistent vision and messaging as a presidential candidate.
He spent several weeks trying to build his campaign around climate change, calling global warming the greatest existential threat the country had ever faced. But as the excitement over his candidacy began to fade, O’Rourke was forced to stage a “reintroduction” of his campaign to reinvigorate it. After a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso, killing 22 people, O’Rourke more heavily embraced gun control, saying he would take assault weapons away from existing owners.
As O’Rourke’s standing in the presidential primary plummeted, some Democrats urged him to return to Texas for another Senate run. He has repeatedly denied having any interest in that race.
O’Rourke’s decision came hours before he was supposed to join other Democratic contenders at a party dinner in Iowa. Campaign volunteers were still collecting voter information and handing out “Beto” stickers” outside the event amid a steady rain as the candidate announced he was dropping out.
O’Rourke did not endorse another Democrat for the nomination, saying the country will be well served by any of the other candidates, “and I’m going to be proud to support whoever that nominee is.”
President Donald Trump quickly weighed in on O’Rourke’s exit, saying in a tweet: “Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was “born for this.” I don’t think so!”

But most House Democrats supported the resolution, formalizing the impeachment process as both sides dig in for a brawl. 
Appearing on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) argues she's working to defend democracy.

Under the rules approved by Democrats for public impeachment hearings, the intelligence committee will release transcripts of those interviews it's been conducting behind closed doors. Republicans can issue subpoenas but only if Democrats on the hearing panel approve them.

Republicans are crying foul.
The president tweeted: ""Read the transcript"" and ""The greatest witch hunt in American history.""
""I was in an impeachment deposition but then had to leave that to come to the floor for a vote on the rules for impeachment,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) pointing out the way he and other Republicans feel the process has been mismanaged.
The House vote comes days after the president met with a group of evangelical Christian leaders at the White House.
""We basically told him, Mister President, you fight well alone, but you're not gonna have to fight well alone because we're going to be standing right there with you every step of the way because we don't actually believe this is about President Trump at all.

A senior White House Official confirmed to us that Health and Human Services would be introducing new federal rules detailing that faith-based groups only need to adhere to nondiscrimination provisions passed by Congress, not any previous agency regulations. Back in 2016, the Obama Administration added sexual orientation language to an HHS rule, forcing faith-based groups to choose between their biblical beliefs on marriage or receiving federal money to serve their communities. 
""This Administration is committed to doing rule-making right, and to removing regulatory barriers that prevent non-profits from doing what they do best—serving the needy and vulnerable in their communities,"" according to this Senior White House Official. ""The Administration is also fully committed to preserving the religious freedom rights of faith-based organizations, and we are proud to announce this proposed rule today doing just that.""
 
Since the new rule would apply to only laws passed by Congress, that means faith-based groups would have to comply with the three main federal laws on equality: the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. All of them protect citizens against religious discrimination but none of them mention sexual orientation. 
In the days before President Obama left office, HHS added the controversial regulation with language covering sexual orientation. The Trump Administration rule would make that regulation null and void. Currently, if faith-based groups want to apply for federal funds, they must request a waiver from the Obama rule. The proposal, that will be announced Friday, is the first step in the regulatory process. There will be a time for public comment before it goes into effect. It is expected to be challenged in court.
 
This move should not come as a shock to those who have followed President Trump's directives closely. The White House has moved to protect medical workers who, due to their religious beliefs, want to opt-out of procedures such as abortion and assisted suicide. They also took action to make sure religious businesses can choose to not enroll in health insurance plans that cover contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs.  
As for protecting the rights of faith-based adoption and foster care providers, Trump has been very clear. At the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this year in Washington, Trump gave a hint of things to come. ""My administration is working to ensure that faith-based adoption agencies are able to help vulnerable children find their forever families while following their deeply held beliefs,"" the president remarked. It's a controversial issue as lawmakers, think tanks, and advocacy groups grapple over whether faith-based groups should be funded by the federal government if they choose not to place children in the homes of same-sex couples. 
 
What isn't controversial is that there is a foster care crisis in America – 443,000 children are in foster care and about 100,000 are waiting to be adopted. For the last five years, the foster care crisis has continued to get worse. The Trump administration believes the new rule will make it easier for faith-based agencies to stay in business and with this crisis boiling over, that's vital to the well being of hundreds of thousands of children. In the past, the administration has pointed to certain cities that saw foster care problems increase substantially after prohibiting faith-based agencies from taking part in their efforts.

In a tweet, President Trump declared the impeachment probe, ""The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!""
Two Democrats joined every Republican in voting ""No"" on the official rules for the House impeachment inquiry, which will entail public hearings.  
Even the Speaker of the House took part in the vote, bringing the tally to 232-196 to pass the resolution formalizing ground rules for impeachment.
""The Republicans are afraid of the truth,"" said Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
Ahead of the vote, the split-screen between the parties was on full display. Next to a graphic cutout of an American flag, Pelosi said democracy is at stake, adding that ""this is something that is very solemn, but also prayerful.""
With a hammer and sickle prop of their own, Republicans are accused Democrats of unprecedented veto power over witnesses. 
""This is Soviet-style rules,"" said Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip. 
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) echoed that sentiment. ""You're trying to put a ribbon on a sham process,"" he said.
The process guides rules for the President's lawyers to cross-examine witnesses and defend President Trump in hearings and outlines Republican and Democrat participation in the inquiry on three committees. 
""We recognize the seriousness of this undertaking,"" said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, adding that the proceedings will allow for public hearings in the Intelligence and Judiciary committees.
The California Democrat said impeachment is a remedy to a president who sacrifices the national interest. 
""I make no prejudgment as to whether that remedy will be warranted when we finish these hearings, I will wait until all the facts are put forward,"" said Schiff.
Committee chairs are now preparing to release transcripts of witness depositions. 
 
To call out Democrats for piling on, Jordan said, ""I was in an impeachment deposition but then had to leave that to come to the floor for a vote on the rules for impeachment.""
The resolution comes as witness interviews continue behind closed doors with Tim Morrison, the top Russia expert on the National Security Council, testifying Thursday ahead of a reported resignation. 
Morrison's testimony comes after Bill Taylor, the top diplomat to Ukraine, said Morrison had a ""sinking feeling"" over President Trump's conversation with Ukraine's president.
That feeling sets the stage for a televised impeachment battle now set to begin."

It includes plans for public hearings after House Republicans demanded transparency for weeks.
The resolution to launch an official inquiry passed along party lines. Only two Democrats voted against it and no Republicans supported it.
 
Both House and Senate Republicans argue the rules outlined in the resolution from House Democrats rob President Trump of the basic right of due process – even as they prepare to hold public hearings and release prior witness testimonies.
 
""Legitimizing an unfair process by voting doesn't make it fair,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told CBN News.
 
The resolution gives top lawmakers on both sides more time to question witnesses. While it also allows Republicans to request witnesses, the fine print gives Democrats the power to veto those requests.
 
""Republicans can't subpoena witnesses unless Schiff agrees – so it is a joke of due process,"" continued Graham.
 
Sen. Graham has introduced his own resolution in the Senate labeling the whole process a sham.
 
""They're creating a process that will be damaging to the presidency. Forget about Trump for a moment, if the House in the future can have closed-door hearings where the President's lawyers can't participate, you selectively leak information out to the public to drive the numbers of the president down, you can literally destroy the presidency,"" warned Graham. ""The reason they're not doing it like they did before is because they don't have a case. This is all politically driven.""
 
Democrats maintain they're following tradition.
 
""They are going forward with one which is something the President and others have insisted on. Secondly, the process is going to be open,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL).
 
They're calling on their Republican counterparts to focus concerns on Colonel Vindman's testimony that the transcript of the infamous Ukraine phone call was incomplete.
 
""It certainly concerns me if the White House has released an incomplete transcript,"" commented Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT).
 
Graham tells CBN News the changes Vindman suggests don't make a difference to him.
 
""I've made my mind up, there's nothing wrong with this phone call and the changes he suggests make no difference to me,"" concluded Graham.
 
Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH), who has heard each witness testify, stands by the ""no quid pro quo"" defense and says he's not concerned with Vindman's testimony.
 
""The fundamental facts have never changed – read the call, we know what President Trump and President Zelenksy have said and the facts I just went through so no it doesn't trouble me,"" said Jordan.
 
He adds that his biggest concern is only one member of Congress knows the whistleblower's identity – House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.
 
""That's what troubles me more than anything else, particularly now that we're less than 13 months before an election,"" added Jordan.

0,2019-10-30T17:30:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/october/twitter-bans-all-political-advertisements,Twitter Bans All Political Advertisements,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Twitter is banning all political advertising from its service, saying social media companies give advertisers an unfair advantage in proliferating highly targeted, misleading messages.
“While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions,” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Wednesday in a series of tweets announcing the new policy.
Facebook has taken fire since it disclosed earlier in October that it will not fact-check ads by politicians or their campaigns, which could allow them to lie freely. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress last week that politicians have the right to free speech on Facebook. 
The issue suddenly arose in September when Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, refused to remove a misleading video ad from President Donald Trump’s campaign that targeted former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate.
In response, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another presidential hopeful, ran her own ad on Facebook taking aim at Zuckerberg. The ad falsely claimed that Zuckerberg endorsed President Donald Trump for re-election, acknowledging the deliberate falsehood as necessary to make a point.
Critics have called on Facebook to ban all political ads. These include CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who recently called the company’s policy of allowing lies “absolutely ludicrous” and advised the social media giant to sit out the 2020 election until it can figure out something better.
Google and Facebook did not have immediate comments on Twitter’s policy change.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, another Democratic 2020 contender, retweeted Dorsey’s announcement, adding the comment, “Good. Your turn, Facebook.”
Dorsey said the company is recognizing that advertising on social media offers an unfair level of targeting compared to other mediums. It is not about free expression, he asserted.
“This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle,” he tweeted. “It’s worth stepping back in order to address.”
Twitter currently only allows certified campaigns and organizations to run political ads for candidates and issues. The latter tend to advocate on broader issues such as climate change, abortion rights and immigration.
The company said it will make some exceptions, such as allowing ads that encourage voter turnout. It will describe those in a detailed policy it plans to release on Nov. 15.
Federal campaigns are expected to spend the majority of advertising dollars on broadcast and cable channels during the 2020 election, according to advertising research firm Kantar, and about 20% of the total $6 billion in spending on digital ads.
Twitter’s policy will start on Nov. 22."

The Rev. Robert Morey said in a statement, ""Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse holy communion to former Vice President Joe Biden. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of church teaching."" 
Biden told MSNBC on Tuesday that he wouldn't discuss the reports.

As 2020 Abortion Battle Escalates, Trump Doubles Down on Abortion Exceptions
This is not the first incident where Communion has been withheld from a politician who advocates abortion. 
In 2007, Providence, Rhode Island Bishop Thomas Tobin told former congressman Patrick J. Kennedy to stop taking Communion over his support for abortion rights.
Bishop Tobin said, ""He said he was a practicing Catholic, that he embraced the faith and the fact that he didn't accept all the teachings of the church didn't make him, in his words, less of a Catholic. In fact, in a way, it does.""
Tobin had said though that the move was meant to be confidential before Kennedy made it public.  
Ten years ago, Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput said politicians who won't oppose abortion should neither call themselves Catholic nor take Communion. He said the Catholic church's pro-life beliefs are more important than ""the vanity or hurt feelings of an individual Catholic governor or senator or even vice president.""
In 2004, then Roman Catholic Archbishop Raymond Burke refused Communion to former senator and presidential candidate John Kerry for his pro-choice stances. 
Lifesite News reported the response from the Kerry Campaign team was unapologetic. Kim Molstre, a Kerry campaign spokeswoman, said, ""The archbishop has the right to deny Communion to whoever he wants, but Senator Kerry respectfully disagrees with him on the issue of choice.""
""I would have to admonish him not to present himself for Communion,"" said Burke. ""I might give him a blessing or something.""
Burke didn't just single out Democrats. He also denied Communion to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2007, a Republican, for supporting abortion rights, according to Catholic News Agency.
""I'm not running for religious office,"" Giuliani said. ""I'm not going to debate the opinion of an archbishop of the Catholic Church or an official of the Protestant Church or a rabbi. That's an interpretation of religion. They're entitled to their interpretation of religion.""
Also in 2008, Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann advised former Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to refrain from receiving for her pro-abortion position.
Naumann directed Sebelius to take ""the necessary steps for amendment of her life which would include a public repudiation of her previous efforts and actions in support of laws and policies sanctioning abortion.""
Instead, Sebelius decided to work against religious rights as secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services in the Obama administration, attempting to force a group of nuns to provide healthcare coverage for abortion-causing drugs.  
The belief of the Catholic Church has historically been that ""abortion willed, either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.""   "

White House Says Second Whistleblower Doesn't Matter: Here's Why
4 Pinocchios: Washington Post Calls Out Adam Schiff's False Claim His Committee Had Not Spoken to Whistleblower
Pelosi's resolution establishing guidelines and procedures for a House impeachment investigation puts one of President Trump's biggest critics in the driver's seat.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff will have the power to call public hearings and oversee the witness list.
The resolution says Republicans can ""suggest"" subpoenas and witnesses, but Democrats have the final say.
In a statement issued Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham criticized the House resolution, arguing that it ""confirmed that House Democrats' impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start.""
""The White House is barred from participating at all,"" Grisham added. ""This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the administration.""
Speaking on Fox News Hannity program, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) had harsh words for the resolution.
""In the history of the country, we've never had the Intelligence Committee participate in an impeachment inquiry. Under the resolution they're going to pass tomorrow, the president's counsel cannot participate in the intel committee inquiry so the president is denied right to counsel and the Republicans can't call witnesses without Schiff agreeing - so this whole thing is a sham.""
One House Democrat says he's not likely to vote for the resolution.
New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew said he's skeptical there's enough evidence to impeach the president and not enough votes in the Senate to convict him.
He told The Washington Post, ""I would imagine that I'm going to vote no unless I see something really unusual. It's not that I'm friends with the president. It's not that I believe he should be protected. I don't mind if he's investigated - but what's going to happen in my mind, it's going to happen here in the House; it will go over to the Senate and then he will believe that he has been exonerated. He will still be the president, and he will still be the candidate - a candidate who has been exonerated by the Senate.""
""Everybody says, 'Be on the right side of history' - I think the right side of history is not to impeach,"" Van Drew added.
He says he's simply not sure the evidence proves Trump did anything that's deserving of impeachment. 
""It's not to protect me politically, because there's no win on this. You're gonna get hurt either way - I just think it's the right thing to do,"" he added. ""I've seen things that are distasteful and things that make you uncomfortable, and I don't like the way they're termed. I don't see it as impeachable."" 
Also, Van Drew emphasized that proof of a crime being committed ""would have been in the transcript"" and that the impeachment process is preventing Congress from tackling more important issues. 
Meanwhile, the first current White House staffer faced impeachment investigators on Tuesday.
In a closed-door deposition, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an Iraq war veteran and a top official with the National Security Council, was asked about being in the situation room listening in on the July 25 call to Ukraine.
In his opening statement, Vindman expressed concern over the call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky. 
Vindman wrote, ""I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen.""
He even feared the call would ""undermine US national security"", reporting those concerns to his superior. 
""I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,"" Vindman added.
President Trump pushed back on Vindman's comments calling him a ""Never Trumper witness"" tweeting ""Was he on the same call that I was? Can't be possible! Please ask him to read the transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!""
Vindman did make clear he's not the whistleblower.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) said legislators should consider the sources of the impeachment inquiry and how the partisan process got started.
""The one thing that is clear is this is all based on one anonymous whistleblower, and there are 435 members of Congress, and only one member, only one member knows who that whistleblower is and that individual is Adam Schiff,"" Jordan said.
""How is that fair that only Adam Schiff knows how this whole thing started?"" he added. ""This is something that we need to get to the bottom of and know how this whole thing started.""
House Democrats are considering a timeline that would include public impeachment hearings before Thanksgiving and votes on whether to impeach Trump by Christmas."

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) refused to support a historic House resolution recognizing the Ottoman Empire's genocide against the Armenian people during World War I. 
Lawmakers overwhelmingly passed the non-binding resolution 405-11 on Tuesday, but Omar was one of three legislators to vote ""present.""
Omar said in a statement explaining her decision that recognizing genocide ""should not be used as a cudgel in a political fight"" but ""should be done based on academic consensus outside the push and pull of geopolitics.""

Omar further justified her decision by claiming that the measure should have included a condemnation of the ""transatlantic slave trade"" and ""Native American Genocide.""
Omar's refusal to back the resolution drew sharp criticism. 
Political analyst Zaid Jilani pointed out that the US has already condemned the slave trade and mistreatment of Native Americans. 
""There's nothing wrong with asking that the US government acknowledge human rights abuses here before we acknowledge them overseas,"" Jilani said on Twitter. ""The issue is, the US government already did acknowledge the ones Omar is asking it to acknowledge. Didn't acknowledge the Armenian genocide at behest of Turkey.""
Congress has passed many resolutions condemning abuses against Native Americans and slavery. It has never passed a resolution condemning the Armenian genocide. That's why Ilhan Omars explanation here rings hollow https://t.co/HztWDR8zGf
— Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) October 29, 2019
Michigan state representative Mari Manoogian, who is an Armenian-American herself, said Omar's statement is ""totally unacceptable.""
""I am deeply disappointed and, frankly, disgusted by this statement issued by @IlhanMN today regarding H.Res. 296,"" Manoogian said on Twitter. ""The whataboutism is from the textbook of denial that the Turkish government has engaged in for more than a century. Totally unacceptable.""
Boston Celtics player Enes Kanter also slammed the freshman congresswoman. 
Kanter, who is Turkish, tweeted: ""What an absolute disappointment and shame that the only democrat who did NOT support the Turkish bill aiming to stop the killing of innocent people is @IlhanMN who seems like on #DictatorErdogan 's payroll working for his interests, but not for the American people and democracy!""
Reporter Jordan Schachtel claimed that Omar refused to condemn the Armenian genocide because of her ""respect"" for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
""Ilhan Omar's failure to vote for the Armenian Genocide recognition resolution has everything to do with her respect for Erdogan and his regime's close ties with her native Somalia. See my article from March to make sense of it,"" he said. 
Omar met with Erdogan in New York City in 2017, while she was a Minnesota state representative.
Omar is an avid supporter of the anti-Israel Boycotts, Sanctions, and Divestment (BDS) Movement. However, she does not support sanctions against Turkey, Iran, Venezuela, and other human rights abusers because she believes sanctions against those countries will hurt innocent people. 
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified Rep. Manoogian as a Minnesota State Representative. She is a Michigan State Representative for the Michigan 40th District."

The historic non-binding resolution is a resounding rebuke to Turkey, which denies the genocide ever happened. 
On Wednesday, Ankara summoned ambassador to Turkey David Satterfield over the vote. 
Turkey quickly rejected the measure as a ""meaningless political step"" and said it risks hurting Ankara's relationship with Washington ""at an extremely fragile time"" for international and regional security.
Congress came close to passing similar resolutions in the past but backed out after facing pressure from Turkey. Tuesday's vote is the first time the US Congress has passed a measure directly blaming Turkey for the genocide against Armenians. 
Armenian National Committee of America Executive Director Aram Hamparian told the Wall Street Journal that the resolution puts America on the right side of history. 
""This vote places America on the side of justice, which has, for far too long, been denied to the victims and surviving generations of the Armenian genocide,"" Hamparian said.
The House also passed a bipartisan bill Tuesday to sanction senior Turkish officials and Turkish forces for the country's invasion into northeastern Syria. That bill passed 403-16.
  
Both bills are a symbol of America's deteriorating relations with Turkey.

Dick Morris told the John Catsimatidis radio show, ""She feels entitled to do it. She feels compelled to do it. She feels that God put her on the Earth to do it.""
According to Morris, the only thing standing in her way is Joe Biden. If Biden drops out, the way is opened for Hillary to get in. Morris said, ""Make no mistake. She wants it...She's planning on it. She'll do everything she can to achieve it.""
As far as our research shows, Hillary herself has not said that she thinks God wants her to be president. She demurred from that idea in a forum at Messiah College in 2008 when she was running for the Democratic nomination the first time, saying with a smile, ""I guess we'll see.""
But whether God wants her to or not, some Democrats are quietly, and not-so-quietly, floating the idea of Hillary carrying their party's mantle once again.
Hillary sure hasn't avoided the spotlight. She stirred the 2020 pot recently when she claimed the Russians had planted Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) to undermine the election as a possible third party candidate.
She also fueled speculation about a Hillary run when she put forth the idea to PBS reporter Judy Woodruff, that perhaps there should be a ""rematch"" between her and Trump, saying, ""Obviously, I can beat him again.""  
Delusional, or just making a joke, it's no joke that anxiety is rising among Democrats about their current field of candidates.
""With Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on maybe pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,"" David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama told The New York Times.
He's referring to Joe Biden. Though still the front runner, there's concern about him. He's struggling with fundraising, he's not shone brightly in debates, and he's being bombarded by family ethical issues that just won't go away. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren is surging in polls, but there's fear someone who wants to eliminate private health insurance is just too far to the left to win a general election against a formidable President Trump.  
A ""who else is there?"" desperation is taking hold. Michael Bloomberg is said to be a favorite among Wall Street Democrats, and he supposedly is toying with the idea, but he reportedly won't take the plunge unless he's sure he can win.
Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown's recent opinion piece in The San Francisco Chronicle is making the rounds among some party insiders, touting Hillary as the great hope of the Democrats – and obviously NOT touting his former lover, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.
""It's time for Hillary Clinton to come out of retirement, lace up the gloves and get back in the ring with President Trump for what would be the biggest political rematch ever,"" he writes.
""Call me crazy, but from what I've seen so far, Clinton is the only candidate short of Barack Obama who has the brains, the battle-tested brawn, and the national presence to take out Trump. And Obama can't run.""
The Washington Post reports people close to Hillary say she's unlikely to do it all again. But... maybe...
""Ultimately, it's unlikely she would do it,"" said one person who has spoken with her. ""But put it this way: It ain't zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely.""
No one's expecting a Biden pull-out from the race, if it happens at all, before the first of the year. But Democrat dissatisfaction with the current line-up and qualms about any of them being able to beat Donald Trump make the speculation hot and heavy about somebody different.
""If Biden were surging, I doubt you would be hearing this,"" Harold Ickes, a longtime Democratic consultant, and Clinton confidant told the New York Times. ""This shows a restlessness among a lot of people."""

In a statement, Graham said there's no doubt in his mind that his resolution forced the Democrats to respond.
On CBN's Faith Nation program, ABC News Political Director Rick Klein said, ""I think it's them acknowledging at least tacitly that so far doing private, closed-door hearings has not worked out on a political level. There's been a lot of pressure from Republicans to say 'put it all out there,' so now we'll begin to see what that process is.""    
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) commented on the closed-door testimony regarding the impeachment inquiry of Trump. 
""This is all a ridiculous unfair partisan process and the American people see through it, so I think the speaker is going to try to dress it up a little bit, put a little lipstick on the pig, as they say, have this vote on Thursday. But it's not going to change anything and I think you're going to see every Republican vote against it,"" Jordan said.
Dr. James Dobson, president and founder of the James Dobson Family Institute, reacted to the impeachment inquiry, insisting that politicians are abusing the process in their quest for more power.
""Over the last several weeks, we have witnessed the dark side of our political process in action. It is abundantly clear that certain politicians are more concerned with using the impeachment inquiry to score political points rather than to honor our constitutional system and seek the good of this nation,"" Dobson said.

House committees are trying to determine if President Donald Trump violated his oath of office by asking a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.
The House will take a vote this week to formalize Democrats' impeachment inquiry amid President Donald Trump's criticism that the probe is ""illegitimate."" 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the step is being taken ""to eliminate any doubt"" about the process. 
In a letter to her colleagues on Monday, Pelosi said the resolution will ""affirm the ongoing, existing investigation"" and layout procedures for open hearings and the next steps going forward. It involves holding public hearings, releasing transcripts from closed-door interviews and transferring evidence to the Judiciary Committee, which will be tasked with drawing up potential articles of impeachment.
She dismissed the White House's argument that impeachment isn't happening without a formal vote, saying that ""of course, this argument has no merit.""
The Constitution doesn't require a vote to begin impeachment. But Trump and his Republican colleagues have cited the lack of one to say that the probe is not real. Trump used that argument in a lengthy letter to the House earlier this month saying that he wouldn't cooperate.
Many government officials have cooperated with the inquiry despite Trump's orders. But Pelosi's letter comes as a national security official defied a House subpoena Monday, escalating the standoff between Congress and the White House over who will testify."

Recent Pew research shows both Republicans and Democrats view each other negatively and more so since the 2016 election.
So does that mean we should avoid the issue of politics altogether in social settings and at upcoming holiday gatherings? 
The women behind the popular podcast, Pantsuit Politics, say absolutely not. In their book, I Think You're Wrong (But I'm Listening), they give advice on how to approach some of those difficult conversations.
 
Sarah Stewart Holland, a Democrat, and Beth Silvers, a Republican, make the purpose of their book clear in its tagline: ""a guide to grace-filled political conversations.""
 
""We talked a lot about whether we wanted to use the word 'grace' because it's a word that we use among ourselves all the time at Pantsuit Politics and a lot of people say, 'Why don't you just talk about civility?' And we realized, we're talking about something deeper than civility,"" explained Silvers in an interview with CBN's Faith Nation.
 
""This is not, let's just be nice and kind in these conversations. Sometimes grace requires a really firm stance. What we wanted to convey with 'grace-filled political conversations' are conversations that connect you to your values.""     
 
Stewart Holland stresses the importance of representing your values in your policy positions as well as how you engage in them. Equally important she says is how you treat the other person and speak about them.
 
""Those reflect your values as well,"" she said.   
 
When it comes to those especially sticky issues like gun control and abortion, the women's advice is to approach the conversation like a reporter.
 
""Sometimes it's best to approach the conversation like a reporter, like somebody who's just curious to learn,"" explained Stewart Holland. ""To think, where did you get that information? Is there anything I could say that would help you see this issue differently? Or sometimes what I like to do is go really, really far out. How does this play historically? Is this different than how somebody 100 years ago would have talked about it? Just giving some bigger, wider perspective to the issues and not just see it as a debate where we have to convince one another.""
 
Both women say you don't have to leave the conversation agreeing on everything. Rather, it's important to seek an understanding of why the other person sees things the way they do.
 
""The goal is not to emerge from the Thanksgiving table with draft legislation,"" said Silvers. ""We come together and connect over politics because they do offer us spaces to explore how we live in community with each other and that's relevant to our families. So we want people to have these conversations but we just want them to understand, the goal isn't to convince anyone. You don't need to walk away all agreeing on who you're going to vote for. It should be a curious exploration.""
 
So why is it not a good idea to, as the saying goes, ""agree to disagree and move on?""  
 
""I hate that statement,"" Stewart said with a slightly exasperated laugh. ""The reason I think we both have such strong reactions is because it sounds like, 'We're done here. We're not going to talk about this.' And that's the opposite of what we want."" 
""What we want people to do is say, 'Okay, I think maybe it's become too heated right now but I care about what you think and I want to continue this conversation later. I want to continue to talk about the issues in our country that matter, the values that are important to us and maybe even become better versed in why we disagree or maybe even find some agreement.'""
 
So, while America may be more divided today than it was a few years ago, it doesn't mean your holiday gatherings have to reflect that. One word to remember in all of your conversations, political or not, is ""grace."" 
 
""Even if I disagree, you're still a person I value and respect in my life. Even if I think this policy position is wrong, I want to hear it out and see what I can learn from it. Grace has that element of 'we belong',"" said Silvers."

But, heightened tensions are expected to rise again as Washington's attention shifts from the raid back to Trump's impeachment inquiry.
The president and many Republicans charge that the House impeachment process is improper. They believe the full House of Representatives should vote to approve the inquiry and the hearings should be held in public, not behind closed doors.
An attorney for Charles Kupperman, former White House national security official, said Kupperman was scheduled to testify on Monday, CNN reports.
If he refuses to take the stand, he could face ""contempt of Congress"" charges for the Ukraine scandal.
Additional witnesses summoned this week are current National Security Council staff members Tim Morrison and Alexander Vindman. 
William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, told lawmakers in his deposition last week that Morrison is essential in the inquiry due to phone calls he had with Morrison that described the Ukraine effort.
Also, committees are scheduled to hear from three other State Department and Defense Department witnesses. Legislators want to determine whether military aid to Ukraine was delayed as a condition of the investigations.
Friday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a resolution condemning the inquiry, which all but three Senate Republicans are co-sponsoring.
""The purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you're engaging in regarding the impeachment of President Trump is out of bounds, is inconsistent with due process as we know it. It's a Star Chamber-type inquiry and it's a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past regarding impeachment of other presidents,"" Graham said.
It takes 67 votes in the Senate to remove a president from office.
Democrats hold 45 Senate seats, plus two independents who caucus with them. That means they would need 20 Republicans to join them in voting to convict.
With at least 50 Senate Republicans supporting Sen. Graham's condemnation of the House impeachment inquiry, the numbers just don't add up for the Democrats to remove Trump from office. 
Amidst mounting pressure, Democrats are reportedly considering making the hearings public as soon as mid-November. "

John Conyers, one of the longest-serving members of Congress whose resolutely liberal stance on civil rights made him a political institution in Washington and back home in Detroit despite several scandals, has died. He was 90.
Conyers, among the high-profile politicians toppled by sex harassment allegations in 2017, died at his home on Sunday, said Detroit police spokesman Cpl. Dan Donakowski. The death “looks like natural causes,” Donakowski added.
Known as the dean of the Congressional Black Caucus, which he helped found, Conyers became one of only six black House members when he won his first election by just 108 votes in 1964. The race was the beginning of more than 50 years of election dominance: Conyers regularly won elections with more than 80% of the vote, even after his wife went to prison for taking a bribe.

Report: $600,000 Dollars in Tax-Payer Money Spent to Settle Senate Claims
Conyers Steps Aside from Judiciary Post Amid Sex Allegations
That voter loyalty helped Conyers freely speak his mind. He took aim at both Republicans and fellow Democrats: He said then-President George W. Bush “has been an absolute disaster for the African-American community” in 2004, and in 1979 called then-President Jimmy Carter “a hopeless, demented, honest, well-intentioned nerd who will never get past his first administration.”
Throughout his career, Conyers used his influence to push civil rights. After a 15-year fight, he won passage of legislation declaring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.‘s birthday a national holiday, first celebrated in 1986. He regularly introduced a bill starting in 1989 to study the harm caused by slavery and the possibility of reparations for slaves’ descendants. That bill never got past a House subcommittee.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Sunday that without Conyers there would be no King holiday — “no doubt about that.”
“He was one of the most consequential congressmen,” Jackson said.
His district office in Detroit employed civil rights legend Rosa Parks from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. In 2005, Conyers was among 11 people inducted to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame.
But after a nearly 53-year career, he became the first Capitol Hill politician to lose his job in the torrent of sexual misconduct allegations sweeping through the nation’s workplaces. A former staffer alleged she was fired because she rejected his sexual advances, and others said they’d witnessed Conyers inappropriately touching female staffers or requesting sexual favors.
He denied the allegations but eventually stepped down, citing health reasons.
“My legacy can’t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we’re going through now,” Conyers told a Detroit radio station from a hospital where he’d been taken after complaining of lightheadedness in December 2017. “This, too, shall pass. My legacy will continue through my children.”
Conyers was born and grew up in Detroit, where his father, John Conyers Sr., was a union organizer in the automotive industry and an international representative with the United Auto Workers union. He insisted that his son, a jazz aficionado from an early age, not become a musician.
The younger Conyers heeded the advice, but jazz remained, he said, one of his “great pleasures.” He sponsored legislation to forgive the $1.6 million tax debt of band leader Woody Herman’s estate and once kept a standup bass in his Washington office.
Before heading to Washington, Conyers served in the National Guard and with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Korean War supervising repairs of military aircraft. He earned his bachelor’s and law degrees from Wayne State University in the late 1950s.
His political aspirations were honed while working as a legislative assistant from 1958 to 1961 to U.S. Rep. John Dingell, a fellow Michigan Democrat who, when he retired in 2014 at age 88, was Congress’ longest-serving member. That mantle then was passed onto Conyers.
Dingell died in February.
Soon after being elected to Congress, Conyers’ leadership at home — in the segregated streets of Detroit — would be tested. Parts of the city were burned during riots in July 1967 that were sparked by hostilities between black residents and Detroit’s mostly white police force, and by the cramped living conditions in black neighborhoods.
Conyers climbed onto a flatbed truck and appealed to black residents to return to their homes, but he was shouted down. His district office was gutted by fire the next day. But the plight of the nation’s inner cities would remain his cause.
“In Detroit you’ve got high unemployment, a poverty rate of at least 30%, schools not in great shape, high illiteracy, poor families not safe from crime, without health insurance, problems with housing,” he told The Associated Press in 2004. “You can’t fix one problem by itself — they’re all connected.”
He was fiercely opposed to Detroit’s finances being taken over by a state-appointed emergency manager as the city declared bankruptcy in 2013. Conyers, whose district included much of Detroit, sought a federal investigation and congressional hearings, arguing it was “difficult to identify a single instance” where such an arrangement, where local officials are stripped of most of their power, succeeds.
Conyers was the only House Judiciary Committee member to have sat in on two impeachment hearings: He supported a 1972 resolution recommending President Richard Nixon’s impeachment for his conduct of the Vietnam War, but when the House clashed in 1998 over articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton, Conyers said: “Impeachment was designed to rid this nation of traitors and tyrants, not attempts to cover up an extramarital affair.”
Conyers also had scandals of his own.
In 2009, his wife Monica Conyers, a Detroit city councilwoman largely elected on the strength of her husband’s last name, pleaded guilty to bribery. The case was related to a sludge hauling contract voted on by the City Council, and she spent nearly two years in prison.
Three years earlier, the House ethics committee closed a three-year investigation of allegations that Conyers’ staff worked on political campaigns and was ordered to baby-sit for his two children and run his personal errands. He admitted to a “lack of clarity” with staffers and promised changes.
But he couldn’t survive the last scandal. An ethics committee launched a review after a former longtime staffer said Conyers’ office paid her more than $27,000 under a confidentiality agreement to settle a complaint in 2015. She alleged she was fired because she rejected his sexual advances, and other said they’d witnesses inappropriate behavior.
Conyers initially said he looked forward to vindicating himself and his family, but he announced his immediate retirement in December 2017 after fellow Democrats called for his resignation. The chorus included Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the House’s top Democrat.
Conyers became chairman of the House Judiciary Committee when Democrats regained the House majority in 2006. He oversaw 2007 hearings into the White House’s role in the firings of eight federal prosecutors and 2009 hearings on how the NFL dealt with head injuries to players.
Conyers frequently swam against the prevailing political currents during his time in Congress. He backed, for example, anti-terrorism legislation that was far less sweeping than a plan pushed by then-Attorney General John Ashcroft in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
He was also an early supporter in 2007 of then-Sen. Barack Obama, who was expected by some in the Congressional Black Caucus to push public health insurance, sharp funding increases for urban development and other initiatives long blocked by Republicans.
“We want him to stand strong,” Conyers said in 2009.
Conyers enjoyed his greatest support back home in Detroit — except when he tried to venture into local politics. Conyers took on 16-year incumbent Mayor Coleman A. Young in 1989, launching his bid with the statement: “Look out, Big Daddy, I’m home.” But a poorly organized campaign helped him finish a mere third in the primary. He ran again for mayor when Young retired in 1993, and lost again.
Along with his wife, Conyers is survived by two sons, John III and Carl.

Will the Democrats cave to the pressure and make the hearings public? House Republicans are demanding witnesses in the ongoing impeachment inquiry be allowed to testify publicly. 
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are pushing a resolution to condemn the ""closed door, illegitimate"" process.

Biggs also joined about two dozen Republicans who marched into the hearing room Wednesday.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer called the Republicans move a distraction attempt.
""When you talk about these secret hearings I laugh because 47 republicans are authorized to be in the room,"" he explained. 
Hoyer also assured, ""everybody's going to have public testimony. They'll be able to see public testimony. They'll be able to read or to hear all of the testimony that has been given or that will be given so these are going to be as we do in a due process was consistent with the Constitution.""

In fact, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) plans to introduce a resolution condemning the closed-door impeachment inquiry, which he calls ""illegitimate.""         
""We cannot allow future presidents and this president to be impeached based on an inquiry in the House that's never been voted upon, that does not allow the president to confront the witnesses against him, call witnesses on his behalf and cross-examine people who are accusing him of misdeeds,"" Graham said on Fox News' Hannity.
One of those witnesses, acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, testified Tuesday that he was told that if the president of Ukraine did not announce he was launching investigations into Joe Biden and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, Trump would not release aid to Ukraine or agree to a White House meeting.
The testimony also said Trump repeatedly told officials he wasn't after a ""quid pro quo,"" but established a trade between the US aid and the investigations.
A White House statement calls Taylor's testimony a ""triple hearsay"" and said the career diplomat is a ""radical unelected bureaucrat"".
Vice President Mike Pence insisted there was no ""quid pro quo.""
""The American people can read the transcript of the phone call the president had with President Zelensky, and they will see there was no quid pro quo,"" Pence told Fox News' The Ingraham Angle.
But Democratic Rep. Andy Levin of Michigan found Taylor's testimony troubling. ""In my ten short months in Congress – it's not even noon, right? – and this is my most disturbing day in Congress so far,"" Levin said.
Meanwhile, the president is under fire for describing the impeachment inquiry as a ""lynching"".
""How dare he compare our constitutional obligation for oversight to a hate crime,"" said Democrat Rep. Karen Bass who is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.
But on CBN News' Faith Nation, a member of the Trump Leadership Council, Dr. Bill Bennett, said it was not a problem to use that word.
""The president is visceral in his reactions – I don't know if you've noticed that – but he tends to say the first thing that comes into his head,"" Bennett said. ""Yeah, I think it's okay, as I think you pointed out, 'high-tech lynching' is what Clarence Thomas said.""
""The Clinton protestors talked about lynching; lynching has become a term much more broadly in use,"" he continued. 
Still, Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden blasted Trump for using the term, and he was then exposed in viral videos showing him using the same word in the Clinton impeachment era.

Voters in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia cast their votes November 5th. 
While President Obama was in the White House, Democrats lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats. Now Democrats are laser focused on getting them back and they're punching Republicans on health care.
In campaign attack ads, Democrats are accusing Republicans of not supporting protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Even though President Trump and Congressional Republicans have said repeatedly that they support protections, there's been no action, and Democrats smell blood.
 
""Republicans just don't do healthcare. This has never been one of their strong suits and it's a real and decades long problem. It's one of the reasons we got the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is because Republicans have paid insufficient attention to this issue,"" Michael Cannon tells CBN News. He's director of health policy studies at Cato Institute.
Tuesday a group of House Republicans working closely with the White House released a proposal they say gives Americans freedom of choice, a clear alternative to socialist policies popular on the left.
  
""Parts of that proposal are really strong. They would take the $828 billion of workers' earnings that employers get to control because of a weird quirk of the tax code - they would give that $828 billion to the workers who earned it - that's a huge change and then the workers could buy their own health insurance. It stays with them as they move from job to job rather than having their employer choose a plan for them that disappears when they move to another job,"" Cannon explains.
Also in the plan, at the president's urging, protections for pre-existing conditions.
        
""We want to protect pre-existing conditions by treating those who are self-employed the same way we treat those with insurance who get it through their job,"" says Rep. Roger Marshall (R-KS) one of the architects of the plan.
How the healthcare debate turns out could have a lot to do with those state legislative races because after the 2020 census those lawmakers will draw congressional lines that will stand through 2030.

""So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!,""  Trump wrote. 
""The fact it has been relentless. The fact is he has been relentlessly attacked by the mainstream media since before he took office that is what the President is talking about here,"" said Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley. 
2020 presidential campaign rivals aren't buying it and pushed back on social media with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) writing ""lynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation's history, as is this President.""
Julian Castro added, ""It is beyond shameful to use the word ""lynching"" to describe being held accountable for your actions.""
But Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) agreed with Trump's tweet calling the impeachment inquiry a ""sham.""
""This is a joke,"" Graham said. ""I'm going to let the whole world know that if we were doing this as a Democratic president, you would be all over me right now. This is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American.""
But even some key Republican lawmakers didn't agree with the choice of words. 
""That's not the language I would use. It's very clear what Democrats are doing here,"" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). 
The catalyst for the infamous tweet could have been due to the testimony of the President's acting ambassador to Ukraine.
It was Bill Taylor's turn in a revolving door of key witnesses.
He first sounded the Ukrainian aid alarm in a text message to the US ambassador to the EU. 
Taylor wrote. ""I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""
The recipient, Gordon Sondland replied, ""the President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quos of any kind."" 
Democrats say during closed-door testimony, Sondland said this message was dictated by the President himself. 
""Every single report starts with behind closed doors, he is not receiving due process – we all are aware of the situation in which Democrats are taking him behind closed doors releasing selective things not in context trying to attack and destroy this President,"" said Gidley.
The White House has asked for a full impeachment vote from the House
Republican lawmakers have echoed that request which would then give them the chance to be involved in the inquiry. 
“President Trump has done nothing wrong — this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution. There was no quid pro quo,"" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement released Tuesday.  ""Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats’ politically-motivated, closed-door, secretive hearings. Every day this nonsense continues more taxpayer time and money is wasted. President Trump is leading the way for the American people by delivering a safer, stronger, and more secure country - the do-nothing Democrats should consider doing the same.” "

So far, most of the investigation has been done in secret with committee members interviewing witnesses behind closed doors. 
Now the New York Times reports they're looking to hold a series of public hearings to convince the American people, and possibly more Republicans, that the president committed impeachable offenses.

White House Says Second Whistleblower Doesn't Matter: Here's Why
4 Pinocchios: Washington Post Calls Out Adam Schiff's False Claim His Committee Had Not Spoken to Whistleblower
That will likely extend the impeachment inquiry into December, longer than they originally planned.
House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) shamed Democrats for secretly pursuing the impeachment process without allowing the president's team access to the case being levied against him.
""This process is rotten to the core. You can talk about process, you can talk about facts. And the facts point out that this process is shrouded in secrecy.""
Also, Scalise tweeted that Democrats are shielding House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) for shamefully conducting impeachment hearings in private. House Democrats blocked Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) resolution, condemning Schiff.
Schiff is also accused of fabricating evidence during a congressional hearing -- dialogue that he claimed were words from Trump when they were words Schiff made up. 
 
""Shame on them for once again shielding Schiff from facing any consequences! He should be censured!"" Scalise said.
Scalise told Fox News, ""It makes you wonder, what is Adam Schiff trying to hide from public view as they are trying to impeach the President with no known high crimes or misdemeanors?""  
Politico reports that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said, ""Each member of Congress must uphold a high standard of honesty and integrity. When it comes to matters of our national security, that responsibility is even greater. Chairman Schiff has fallen short in his duty."" 
BELOW Eric Metaxas told CBN News: 'I Think Democrats Impeachment Inquiry is a Witch Hunt.'
Meanwhile, the president is calling on Republicans to be stronger in his defense. 
""They have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election. They're lousy politicians, but two things they have - They're vicious, and they stick together. They don't have Mitt Romney in their midst,"" Trump said.
GOP Sen. Mitt Romney has said he's open to impeachment if there's evidence the president held up military aid to Ukraine to fulfill a political purpose.
Democrats continue to defend their decision to hold closed-door sessions with impeachment witnesses and refused to hold a vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry.
Trump and the GOP have argued that it's a requirement since a vote to authorize an ""inquiry"" happened in both the Clinton and Nixon impeachment proceedings."

This isn't a passage out of Frankenstein. It's research happening today and unsuspecting taxpayers are funding it.
""It's abhorrent on so many levels,"" Anthony Bellotti tells CBN News. He's founder and president of White Coat Waste Project, a Washington-based group exposing experiments they consider a waste of life and tax money.
Experiments like one in which the reproductive tracts from aborted 13-week-old twin girls were stripped out and implanted into mice.

In Planned Parenthood Body Parts Trial, Abortion Doc Says Pricing Baby Parts for a Lamborghini Was 'Lighthearted'
Last year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded 200 similar studies across 50 institutions, mostly universities, in 33 states.
This year the NIH estimates it will spend $120 million of taxpayer money on research using aborted baby parts.
""This is a crisis now. This problem is growing in spite of Republicans, Democrats, pro-lifers, animal advocates – nobody wants this,"" Bellotti says.
Terrisa Bukovinac runs Pro-Life San Francisco. The bulk of the research happens in her backyard at the University of California San Francisco.
""One of the most infamous projects that was recently canceled by the Trump administration was a project that involved humanizing mice and that project required two pristine healthy fetuses between the ages of 18 and 24 weeks per month,"" she tells CBN News.
Nearly 70 members of Congress from both parties are working to expose these gruesome experiments. They've issued a letter demanding information from Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar. 
Among other things, they want to know the number of different babies used in each project and the gestational ages of each. 
""It is deeply saddening to me that our own government would be part of creating this marketplace for the buying and selling of baby parts,"" Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) tells CBN News. He's one of the members of Congress leading the charge to educate members and Americans about the research.
In June, the Trump administration took steps to end human fetal research, but loopholes allow most of it to continue.
            
In response, more than 90 research institutions wrote Secretary Azar to say ""fetal tissue remains an essential resource."" They credit it with helping in the development of vaccines against polio, chickenpox, and rabies. And they write, ""It remains critical for ongoing clinical research on potential treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, and human development.""
Opponents agree this is important research, but argue there are alternatives to human fetal tissue. Using it, they say, encourages late-term abortions which produce more developed babies that are more lucrative when sold for research.
That means abortion doctors receive incentives to use techniques that preserve babies and all their parts for science experiments.
""So, the only way they can do these abortions is through a live dismemberment or a medical induction which according to the Society of Family Planning is very likely to produce born-alive infants,"" Bukovinac explains.
Rep. Gaetz says the experiments go against American values. 
""To our core, to our founding. The recognition of the importance of life is who we are and we can never get away from that,"" he says.
Legislation has been introduced that would prohibit any Secretary of Health and Human Services from authorizing research that uses aborted baby parts. Research on stillbirth or miscarriage tissue would still be allowed."

He has 18 percent of support there while Sen. Elizabeth Warren has climbed to 17 percent and Mayor Pete Buttigieg has 13 percent.
Warren has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, moving up to the top of the Democratic presidential field with her aggressive grassroots campaign and progressive platform that includes Medicare-for-All, bold initiatives to address climate change, and breaking up big banks and big tech.
CBN News recently heard from Warren about her plans, and we also asked what she thinks of revoking the tax-exempt status of churches who don't support same-sex marriage. More about that in a moment. But first, some critics are asking Warren tough questions about how she would pay for her expensive new programs.
 
""Let me tell you where big structural change starts, it starts by tackling corruption head on,"" said Sen. Warren at a recent rally in Norfolk, VA.
 
Speaking to a crowd of about 4,000, Warren laid out plans for canceling student debt and getting rid of college tuition.
 
""We can provide tuition-free technical school, two-year college, four-year college for anyone who wants to get an education,"" continued Warren.  
 
She's promising all this and more through implementing a wealth tax on anyone with more than $50 million in assets. Warren says they would pay an additional two cents for each dollar over 50 million.
 
""Two cents and we can make an investment in an entire generation,"" added Warren.
 
But other candidates challenge her plans and the math – particularly covering Medicare-for-All.
 
""At least Bernie is being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up and I'm sorry Elizabeth but you have not said that,"" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) at last week's debate. ""And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.""
 
Many attendees at the town hall tell CBN News they're on board with universal health care.
 
""I think that the arguments against giving people a fair shot at health care are ridiculous,"" said Melissa Bowman of Norfolk, VA.
 
""I do think that health care should be something that we consider as a right and not a privilege,"" added Christopher Matthews.
 
And many trust she'll find a way to pay for it.
 
""I think she has a plan and there are much smarter people than me thinking about it,"" said Cody Jefco of Oklahoma.  
 
Even it means higher taxes for the middle class. ""We're already paying it,"" continued Bowman.
 
Other Virginia Democrats still haven't chosen a candidate to support.
 
""I think we need somebody who's able to appeal to those who are more liberal but also more middle of the road, so I don't know who that person is,"" said Monica Agudelo of Norfolk.
 
Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke (D) recently made headlines for his answer on whether or not churches and religious institutions should lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage.
 
""Yes,"" responded O'Rourke. ""There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us. So as president, we're going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.""
 
Warren told CBN News she disagrees.
 
""We have a long tradition in our country of permitting churches to make their own decisions about how they worship. I respect that tradition and I would not change it,"" said Warren.
 
With the first caucuses still a few months away, the question remains if Senator Warren can maintain her steady rise in the polls when it matters most.

The change in plans came two days after Acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney announced during a meeting on Thursday that Doral would host the summit next June.
Mulvaney said the decision to have the summit at Doral came after visiting 10 other sites across the country. He insisted that there would be no profit and that the resort was ""far and away the best physical facility.""

""I thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!""
Trump mentioned that his property could host the summit in August, praising the facilities and its proximity to Miami's international Airport.
Before Trump's announcement, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticized Doral as the site for the summit.
""Hosting the G7 at Trump's hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain,"" the former vice president said.

Taking the podium in the White House briefing room for the first time in his current role, Mick Mulvaney fiercely defended the president. 
""I have news for everybody, get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy,"" he said suggesting the president's July conversation with the president of Ukraine was standard operating procedure.

As a matter of policy, Mulvaney says the president isn't a fan of foreign aid, especially to countries known for corruption. He says while the US was withholding military aid to Ukraine as Trump grew frustrated European countries weren't paying their fair share.
""Did he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it and that's why we held up the money,"" Mulvaney told reporters.
Democrats on Capitol Hill quickly pounced, calling Mulvaney's words an admission of the president's guilt.
""Things have just gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) who serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
Later Mulvaney accused White House reporters of misconstruing his words to advance a political witch hunt writing, ""Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election."" 
As Mulvaney's words reverberated in Washington, in Dallas, some 20,000 Trump supporters chanted, ""Four more years,"" during a Make America Great Again rally.
The president told supporters House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) hands out subpoenas like they're cookies.
""I have people getting subpoenas I've never heard of. I said who are those people?"" the president asked.
One of those people who has received a subpoena is stepping down. Energy Secretary Rick Perry handed in his resignation Thursday onboard Air Force One with the president as he traveled to Perry's home state of Texas.
President Trump called him a ""terrific guy"" and said he's known for six months that Perry planned to step down at the end of the year.
However, Perry has come under scrutiny over the role he played in Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
Once a skeptic about the need for a federal Department of Energy, in an exclusive interview with CBN News this month, Perry said he's changed his mind and is proud to have played a role in America's break from dependence on foreign oil.
""We've become the number one oil and gas producing country in the world,"" he said.
Perry is one of Trump's longest-serving cabinet members.
Each week he joins Cabinet counterparts for a Bible study led by Capitol Ministries.
""To be with people who share your values. I happen to think it's one of the most consequential things that I do in this administration is to meet with then, to study the Bible, to reflect for this administration, reflect for President Trump that he is surrounded by men and women who are grounded in Judeo-Christian values,"" he tells CBN News.
Perry has been given a deadline of today to hand over documents subpoenaed from House Democrats related to his work in Ukraine."

Pence said there will be a 5-day ceasefire to allow Kurdish troops, who are US allies, to evacuate from the area. He said there's also an agreement to protect religious minorities in northern Syria. After that initial ceasefire, a more enduring ceasefire is going to kick in, based on the negotiations.
“President Erdogan and I spoke at great length about the importance of protecting religious minorities in the region...part of our agreement is to continue to work very closely to ensure that religious minorities can thrive,” Pence said.
Pence said the US and Turkey have ""mutually committed to peaceful resolution."" The agreement was reached after Erdogan was notified that massive sanctions would be implemented against Turkey, but Pence said the US and Turkey will maintain a strong relationship.
""The United States did not support Turkey's military action,"" Pence stated. ""President Trump made that clear.""
He said the United States is committed to implementing a safe zone in northern Syria.
Turkey began invading northern Syria after President Trump began withdrawing US troops from Syria. The president had doubled down to defend his move, downplaying Turkey's military invasion of the region even as his top aides were sent on an emergency mission to try and defuse that growing conflagration inflicted by Turkey's authoritarian leader. 
Now Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo have worked with Turkish leaders to convince them to back down from the bloodshed. 
The meeting in Turkey comes one week after President Trump announced the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria. The move opened the door for Turkey to invade and attack Kurdish forces who are former US allies in the fight against ISIS.
Trump has stood by his decision to withdraw US troops saying it comes down to a land dispute that doesn't involve the United States. He also says he's fulfilling a campaign promise to bring American troops home. ""Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria is not happy about it,"" he said Wednesday. ""Let them work it out.""
Meanwhile, Trump has been facing another type of battle on the home front, tweeting pictures from a heated White House meeting with Democrat leaders Wednesday.
""Do you think they like me?"" he wrote, referring to top Democrats who later walked out of the meeting, charging the president with insulting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Pelosi is not only trying to impeach him, she had also just passed a House resolution condemning him for what's happening in Syria.
""What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown,"" Pelosi told reporters. ""Sad to say.""
GOP members who were there had a different take on what happened. ""I see a pattern of behavior with Speaker Nancy Pelosi,"" Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said. ""She storms out of another meeting, trying to make it unproductive. The other Democrats stayed and actually had a very productive meeting.""
Pelosi said Trump was ""shaken"" by a vote earlier on the House floor to condemn his Syria decision.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) also announced bipartisan sanctions against Turkey. Graham, one of President Trump's closest allies, had tough words for the president on Wednesday's 700 Club.
""I am looking for President Trump to change this. I will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump's worst nightmare,"" Graham had said. ""I will not sit along the sidelines and watch a good ally, the Kurds, be slaughtered by Turkey and watch Iran move in to Syria and become another nightmare for Israel. This is a defining moment for President Trump. He needs to up his game.""
Trump fired back after he heard Graham's comments. ""Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years,"" said Trump.  
On the ground in Syria, the Kurds claim Turkish forces are using banned chemical weapons, like napalm and white phosphorous.
Meanwhile, more than 100,000 refugees need help. CBN's Operation Blessing is working with the Barzani Charity Foundation to provide relief, including thousands of boxes of food, cases of water, blankets, baby formula and hygiene kits.
Late Wednesday, Trump released a letter he sent to Erdogan last week.
""Let's work out a good deal,"" the letter said. ""You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy – and I will."""

Elijah Cummings died this morning. The US congressman from Maryland died at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges, his congressional office said. He was 68.
As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, he was central in the Democrats' efforts to impeach President Trump.
He publicly sparred with the president and led numerous investigations into the president, his family, and his financial records.    
His widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings said in a statement, ""Congressman Cummings was an honorable man who proudly served his district and the nation with dignity, integrity, compassion and humility. He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our problem.""
One of his political rivals in Congress, Trey Gowdy, honored Cummings with a powerful tribute on Twitter:
Cummings was a sharecropper's son who rose to become one of the most powerful members of the US Congress.
The Associated Press reports that when Cummings was in grade school, a counselor told him he was too slow to learn and spoke too poorly to become a lawyer which was his dream. That compelled Cummings to fight hard to achieve his goal. ""I was devastated,"" Cummings told the AP in 1996, shortly before he won his seat in Congress. ""My whole life changed. I became very determined.""
He was a fiery voice in Congress, supporters praising him for highlighting the struggles and needs of inner-city residents.
Cummings had been temporarily away from Congress after an unspecified medical procedure. In recent years he had undergone treatment for heart and knee issues.

But there has been some back-and-forth today on whether Erdogan will actually take a meeting with the Trump administration team. 
Meanwhile here in Washington, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are weighing the next steps when it comes to the situation in Syria.
 
Many, from both sides of aisles, disagree with the president and want to see more actions against Turkey as a result of the attacks. The House of Representatives has even passed a resolution condemning Trump's troop withdrawal.
Since the president's surprise announcement to remove those troops serving in Syria, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has been a vocal opponent on the issue, challenging President Trump to find a solution to the new problem that's unfolding in Syria right now.
Sen. Graham said, ""I'm going to introduce sanctions tomorrow with Democrats that are going to be sanctions from Hell. They're going to be like Iranian sanctions against Turkey, I'm going to break this thug's back, we're going to stand by the military, and to President Trump, if you're listening to this interview, if you remove all of our forces from Syria, you're throwing the Kurds over, ISIS will come back on your watch, and Iran will take over and you my friend, will be in great jeopardy of losing the election. We can't afford you to lose.""
Graham continued, ""The President's put sanctions on but I'm going to go further. My sanctions would sanction Erdogan and his family and find out how much money he's stolen from the Turkish people. My sanctions would go after their energy sector where they get most of their money. It would take the two top Turkish banks in the world and say you can't do business with those banks as long as Erdogan's in Syria.""
""They're a NATO ally, I'd like to have a good relationship, but we're not going to let Erdogan slaughter the allies that helped us defeat ISIS, the Kurds. We're not going to give Iran part of Syria to make a nightmare for Israel, and at the end of the day my friend, this is a defining moment for President Trump,"" Graham said."

At the Capitol, Pelosi is holding firm in her position that the House will not hold an official vote on the impeachment inquiry. ""They can't defend the president, so they're going to process. We're not going there,"" she said.
Republicans say Democrats are not following a fair impeachment investigation. ""House Democrats have wasted no time throwing fairness and precedent to the wind,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). 
""Already, they've denied their Republican counterparts certain minority rights like equal subpoena power that Republicans provided Democrats during the Clinton impeachment,"" he continued.
The office of Vice President Mike Pence says he won't hand over documents involving Ukraine, and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani says he doesn't plan to submit documents in compliance with a congressional subpoena.
The White House Budget Office says, it, too, will not comply with a subpoena.
Meanwhile, a New York Times report says former top Russia advisor Fiona Hill testified that former National Security Advisor John Bolton was extremely concerned about Giuliani's activities in Ukraine.
Giuliani is accused of engaging in a rogue operation to get Ukraine to investigate whether Joe Biden and his son Hunter were involved in corruption regarding Hunter's ability to gain a key position with a Ukrainian energy company.
Hunter Biden says he did not do anything unethical in taking a position with that Ukrainian company, but he told ABC News that he might not have gotten the job if his last name wasn't Biden.
""I thought he really made a big gaffe when he basically said that, 'Yeah, my last name does mean something, and Burisma did hire me because my name is Biden',"" commented CBN News chief political analyst David Brody on CBN News' Faith Nation. 
""Well, if that's the case, then what Trump and Giuliani have been saying all along, which is, 'Exactly, you were hired because your last name is Biden, so therefore, what did they expect when they hired you? What did Burisma expect?'"" Brody continued.
""And I think that's where Trump wants to go with the corruption angle here, and that is something that they want to see investigated,"" he added.
More administration officials are expected to testify in coming days, including US ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, over text messages sent between him and administration officials in Ukraine."

It became pretty clear from the start of this Democrat debate that the newly crowned front-runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was in for some friendly fire.
 
""We heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,"" said Mayor Pete Buttigieg after Warren seemed to dodge a question on whether her Medicare for All plan would increase taxes on the middle class. 
 
""Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families,"" Warren declared.  
 
Warren's declaration wouldn't get her off the hook, instead prompting a sharp retort from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). ""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,"" said Klobuchar. 
 
But there was plenty of heat to go around. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and fellow servicemember Mayor Pete Buttigieg sparred over the president's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria. 
 
""Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war,"" said Gabbard.  
 
However, South Bend, Indiana mayor Buttigieg redirected the blame to President Trump. 
 
""Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong.  The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence.  It's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,"" said Buttigieg. 
 
Buttigieg also took on former Congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) over gun control and his proposal for mandatory buybacks.
 
""We don't go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law.  I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, non-gun-owners alike to respect and follow the law,"" O'Rourke explained. 
 
""Look, Congressman, you just made it clear that you don't know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets,"" accused Buttigieg.  
 
On a night where the Ukraine controversy dominated the headlines, Vice President Joe Biden addressed the issue early on. 
 
""Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.  And that's what we should be focusing on,"" said Biden. 
 
In a break from the charged discussion, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) thanked his counterparts and the American people for their concern over his recent heart attack. 
""Let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening,"" said Sanders. 
 
With the fourth debate on the books, the candidates can breathe easier for a moment. However, it only gets harder from here. The next debate will require 3 percent in four DNC-approved polls and donations from 165,000 unique donors. So far, key candidates such as O'Rourke, Klobuchar, and Gabbard haven't made the cut.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Tuesday that she's not going to call for a formal House vote on impeachment.
Trump calls the impeachment inquiry ""illegitimate"" and says the House needs to go on the record with a vote. Republicans want to put politically vulnerable Democrats in a tight position in areas where the president remains popular.
Pelosi counters that Congress is well within its authority to investigate as part of its oversight role. The Constitution gives the House impeachment powers but provides little guidance on the process.
Trump is being investigated over his effort to have Ukraine investigate political rival Joe Biden.

Hunter Biden is denying claims by President Trump and his Republican allies who question how he gained access to foreign positions in Ukraine and China. He now says he probably overlooked the potential impact it could have on his father's political career.
During a new interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden admits that he might have made a mistake for failing to consider the effects of his foreign involvement. 
""Did I make a mistake based on some ethical lapse? Absolutely not. I don't think there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden,"" he said.
Joe Biden discussed the issue over the weekend, promising to ban family members from holding any office within the White House if he is elected. 
But Biden has yet to respond to Trump's allegations while facing a national debate audience.
Bernie Sanders will likely be asked about his health after his recent heart attack.
Also, Elizabeth Warren may face questions over whether or not her health care plan would mean higher taxes for the middle class - a question critics say she has dodged.
A new poll shows Warren with a slight lead over Biden - 30 percent to 27 percent. The Quinnipiac University survey has Sanders in third with eight percent.
The first actual voting among Democrats will be in the Iowa caucuses on February 3rd of next year.

Graham says it's indicative of a much broader moral slide by progressives in American politics.
""I think the Left, the socialists have made it very clear that they stand against the church,"" Graham tells CBN News. ""Unless we bow down and accept their agenda as it relates to the LGBTQ agenda, then they'll take our tax exempt status, and everybody in the room cheered and clapped when he said that. And of course the other candidates clapped and cheered as well. And that just shows you where their heart is and where they're going to go.""
Graham says this is not about being against a group of people. Instead, it's about sharing the true freedom and hope that come from following God's ways that are made clear in the Bible.

First, at-bat Monday is President Trump's former Russia Ambassador Fiona Hill who testified in front of lawmakers behind closed doors. 
Hill resigned as President Trump's top Russia analyst days before the now-infamous phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.
House Democrats want to know if Trump withheld $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to get them to investigate the Bidens.
""Impeachment. I never thought I'd see or hear that word with regard to me,"" Trump said.
Trump addressed an audience of enthusiastic Evangelical Christians at the Values Voter Summit Saturday night in Washington. 
It's there he denied pressuring Ukraine to investigate a 2020 political rival.
""The text message that I saw from Ambassador Sondland – who is highly respected – was, there's ""no quid pro quo,"" said Trump. ""He said that.""
Gordon Sondland is under subpoena and will be asked about those texts with the President.
The US Ambassador to the EU is expected to testify later this week over the objections of the State Department. 
""Let me say I'm delighted he is coming in,"" said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) ""I'm anticipating hearing what he has to say because he's certainly key.""
This, as Hunter Biden announced he will step down from the board of a Chinese company.
He also pledged not to work on behalf of any foreign company if his father is elected to the presidency. 
""No one, no one has indicated of any consequence that anything was done wrong or illegally by me or my son,"" Joe Biden said. 
The President renewed his call to unmask the whistleblower and have them testify publicly on Capitol Hill.
But House Intel Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) says the whistleblower's testimony may no longer be necessary given that the White House released the call record, a phone conversation the whistleblower did not hear firsthand. "

Trump said McAleenan wanted to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.
“We have worked well together with Border Crossings being Way down,” Trump tweeted.
His departure creates yet another top-level vacancy in Trump’s Cabinet — at the department responsible not only for immigration enforcement but also for helping states secure elections.
McAleenan said in a subsequent tweet that he wanted to thank the president for his support and that he’d work with the Department of Homeland Security on a smooth transition.
He took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen quit, and he was the fourth person to lead the department in two years. Trump hasn’t named anyone to the job yet — the acting deputy is David Pekoske, the head of the Transportation Security Administration.
McAleenan, a longtime U.S. Customs, and Border Protection official, was seen as a level head who could effectively manage the border crisis, but like many other former administration officials who came before, Trump eventually soured on him.
His tenure was marked by internal squabbling and jockeying by others in the department vying for top jobs, all playing out against a backdrop of outrage and horror amid reports of children being held in squalid conditions and images of those who perished trying to make the trek.
The 240,000-person department is tasked with election security and cybersecurity, disaster response and even the Secret Service. But for Trump, the Department of Homeland Security means one thing: immigration. The president’s signature issue makes the department his focus and his ire. Balancing a White House eager to push major changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge.
McAleenan, who has years of experience with border issues, was seen initially in Trump’s circle as someone who could get control over the crisis, despite his stance as a moderate who pushed for aid to be restored to Central American nations.

His speech comes as there's a growing concern in his evangelical base over his decision to pull troops out of Syria because it leaves US allies like the Kurds and Syrian Christians without protection. 
As the president shows no signs of changing his mind when it comes to pulling US troops out of Syria, his evangelical base, which played a key role in sending him to the White House in 2016, is speaking out and letting him know they do not support him in the pullout.
""It's going to probably go down as the worst decision of his presidency,"" conference attendee Noah Brandt from Missouri told CBN News.
Many at the summit fear that the US pulling support out of Syria will put religious minorities and our Kurdish allies in imminent danger. 
""I was talking with a lot of people last night and people were saying this is the first time that President Trump has done something that they really disagree with,"" said Anna Kepes from Illinois
Brandt told CBN News he also has concerns about the president's phone call with the president of Ukraine.
""I don't think that the president of the United States should be using his political power to try to hurt his political opponents. And I think that even a charitable reading of the transcript shows that's probably what President Trump was trying to do.""
And while he thinks an inquiry is alright, he doesn't think House Democrats should lead it.
""There might be some smoke for this one, but I don't know if they can be trusted based on what they've done in the past,"" he remarked. 
Other attendees condemned the inquiry.
""There's really nothing that President Trump has done that's glaringly wrong,"" one attendee told CBN News. 
""I think it's less an impeachment inquiry as it is a political movement to try and obfuscate the facts that are true,"" said Mike Oakley from Alabama
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) agrees. 
""They're not seeking the truth,"" Meadows told the summit's audience Friday. ""They're seeking a narrative. A narrative they've already written the conclusion to.""
Meadows criticized House Democrats for their lack of transparency in the process.
""Even before this president was sworn in, they were bound and determined to do it and we need to send a clear message if they do it we will send them home,"" he said.
One thing all attendees at the summit cheered for - a call to pray.
""I'm here to tell you that our nation will be healed with committed believers and people on their knees before the Heavenly Father praying for our land each and every day,"" Meadows said. 
In addition to growing concern amongst his evangelical base on his decision on Syria, Trump is also facing mounting pressure from lawmakers in his own party to change his mind. "

Also on Friday, two associates of Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani were taken into custody.
""They were about to board an international flight with one-way tickets,"" US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Jeffrey Berman said. 
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were allegedly involved in Giuliani's efforts to investigate the dealings of Joe Biden's son, Hunter.
""The defendants broke the law to gain political influence while avoiding disclosure of who was actually making the donations and where the money was coming from,"" Berman said. 
Prosecutors say the men were not only scheming to use foreign money to influence US elections, but they were also trying to get Yovanovich fired from her post. 
This news comes as House Democrats subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry's documents pertaining to his Ukraine visit.
Perry spoke exclusively to CBN News about the matter.
""I never heard, and I talked to the president about this,"" Perry said. I had a conversation with - a phone call - with Rudy Guiliani about it. I've talked to the previous ambassador. I've talked to the current ambassador. I've talked to Kurt Volker, Gordan Sondland, the EU ambassador- every name that you've seen out in the media and not once, not once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son ever mentioned.""
Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, is now set to testify next Thursday after receiving a subpoena. 
Earlier this week, the White House demanded that Sondland not talk to lawmakers. 
Meanwhile, President Trump's finances could face a lot more scrutiny soon. A federal appeals court has ruled that his financial records must be turned over to the House of Representatives."

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke shocked even some fellow liberal politicians like Pete Buttigieg last week when he said churches should lose their tax-exempt status if they don't support gay marriage. Now he's trying to backpedal those comments.
At a CNN Democratic town hall debate Thursday night,  O'Rourke was asked, ""Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, and charities should lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?""

""There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us,"" the former Texas 16th district congressman replied. ""So as president, we're going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.""
Sen. Sasse Slaps O'Rourke's 'Extreme Intolerance'
O'Rourke's comments immediately drew backlash from conservatives. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) released a statement Friday condemning O'Rourke for ""extreme intolerance.""
""This bigoted nonsense would target a lot of sincere Christians, Jews, and Muslims,"" wrote Sasse. ""Leaders from both parties have a duty to flatly condemn this attack on very basic American freedoms.""
""This extreme intolerance is un-American,"" Sasse went on. ""The whole point of the First Amendment is that…everyone is created with dignity and we don't use government power to decide which religious beliefs are legitimate and which aren't.""
Dr. Dobson and Others Call Out Democrat War on Religious Liberty
Dr. James Dobson, president of the James Dobson Family Institute, responded to the Democrats calls for a cultural war on religious liberty.
""Last night, presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke pledged that, if elected, he would seek to strip 501(c)(3) tax exemptions from religious groups that hold to biblical views on human sexuality and marriage. Unfortunately, he's not the only one,"" Dobson said in a statement released Friday.  
""Where it was once reasonably expected for all government officials to embrace the First Amendment and defend the freedoms of expression and belief, we are now witnessing the steady deterioration of such bipartisan unity in regard to our most sacredly held freedoms. Certain House Democrats are also boldly pledging their own cultural war on our religious liberties, in direct conflict to the Constitution they claim to serve,"" Dobson continued.
""This outright attack on religious freedom is disgraceful and should prompt an outcry from all advocates of true tolerance and diversity,"" he said. ""The vast majority of Americans recognize and cherish the freedoms that fortify the foundation of this nation. We should expect and demand our elected officials do the same.""
Luke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel for Becket Law, chimed in during the town hall, tweeting, ""Stripping tax-exempt status from religious groups, solely because of their religious belief in traditional marriage, would be a major attack on #ReligiousFreedom.""
""If one of these candidates has the burden of governing this whole diverse, complex country, I would hope they wouldn't be as flippant as they're being during this campaign so far when it comes to that real stake that religious freedom has in these conversations,"" Michael Wear, chief strategist for the And Campaign told Deseret.com. 
Beto Backtracks After Backlash, Even from Buttigieg
O'Rourke's reply also drew negative reactions from liberals like fellow 2020 presidential contender Pete Buttigieg who is gay himself.
""I agree that anti-discrimination law should be applied to all institutions, but the idea that you are going to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they haven't found their way to blessing same sex marriage, I am not sure he understood the implications of what he was saying. That means going to war, not only with churches, but with mosques and a lot of organizations that may not have the same view of various religious principles I do,"" Buttigieg told CNN.
The O'Rourke campaign e-mailed the online magazine Slate with a response to all the backlash saying, ""(Beto) would support revoking the tax exempt status for a religious institution that fired an employee or refused to hire someone b/c they were in a same-sex marriage. He would not, however, revoke tax-exempt status for a religious organization he simply disagree (sic) with.""
Social Media Snark
Social media users also fired away at O'Rourke for his comments intended to sway the LGBTQ vote. Some reminded him about the US Constitution that if elected as president, he would have to vow to defend, protect and uphold. 
A user identified as James Bolfik replied, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""
Another user wrote, ""@BetoORourke say hello to Fascism, what color boots will the stormtroopers wear when they kick the church doors in?""
Another user brought up the Constitution writing, ""May not play well with the constitution.  All that annoying stuff about the government telling citizens what religious beliefs they should have.  And stuff.""
The outrage was widespread with a seemingly endless amount of condemnation for Beto's attack on religious freedom.
One user also brought up basic American freedoms, writing, ""I think it would be quicker for  @BetoORourke to name the freedoms he actually believes in than to name the freedoms he wants to take away.""
A user with the name of Bringbackcommonsense wrote, ""This man needs prayer. He has no understanding of the word of God. May God have mercy on his soul and open his eyes to his sin and ignorance."" 
Still another user replied, ""I hope he's better at selling furniture."""

These 3 Democrats Lead the Field as Trump Battles Impeachment,"It's being seen as a game-changer for the Democratic Party: now three of the remaining 19 candidates have pulled away from the rest, clawing their way to the top of the 2020 presidential campaign.
The big gainer? Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. 
Joe Biden, who's been caught up in the web of President Trump's impeachment inquiry, is right there with Warren at the top. 
And even after a heart attack, self-described socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders is hot on their trail.
Biden has held a steady lead in polling but has seen a drop in third-quarter fundraising. Now Warren is topping the former vice president in some polls, and at just over $25 million, Warren pulled in the biggest pile of cash last quarter out of the nearly 20 candidates. 
Close behind, Sanders pulled in just under $25 million and is leading the 16 other candidates in most polls.
Biden's $15 million draw puts him in fourth place behind candidate Pete Buttigieg in the money game for the 2020 White House run.
Energizing her campaign, chants of ""two cents"" have become a frequent rallying cry at Warren campaign events. Warren's wealth tax of two cents on the dollar amounts to an annual two-per-cent tax on wealth over $50 million, and would require ultra-wealthy Americans to ""pitch in two cents so everybody has a chance to make it in America,"" said Warren. 
Sanders has an even more aggressive tax plan on extreme wealth, and both are favorites among liberal voters. 
But with Warren winning three out of four recent polls, moderate voters are taking Warren's two cents seriously.
""She's trying to be the tortoise in the race,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor, and publisher of ""Inside Elections.""
On CBN News' ""Faith Nation,"" Gonzalez attributed Warren's rise to a slow and steady campaign strategy.  
""It's still complicated,"" he added. ""As long as Bernie Sanders is in the race, it's complicated for her to overtake Vice President Biden, but we have a long way to go."" 
If slow and steady wins the race, Sanders could be in luck. 
Days after suffering a heart attack, the 78-year-old was planning to slow his campaign, but that didn't stop the Vermont senator's campaign from releasing a plan to ban corporate money from politics. 
""Let's break them up,"" said Warren at a recent union event in Los Angeles.
The 70-year-old Massachusetts senator wants to break up big tech giants that she says are violating anti-trust laws. 
At the same event, Warren's 76-year-old rival and former vice president took on Wall Street. 
 
""Wall Street did not build America, the middle class built America and unions built the middle class, period,"" said Biden. 
Wall Street is a familiar punching bag for all the Democrats and Biden's perch at the top of the field relies in part on his appeal to blue-collar Democrats.
The former VP may be against some far-left plans like Medicare-for-All, but has pledged to eliminate President Trump's tax cuts. 
For that and for his top-dog status, Biden has become Trump's favorite target.
""I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden,"" said President Trump recently on the White House South Lawn.
Biden's name is now mentioned almost daily because of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump for pressuring Ukraine's president to investigate the Biden family.
""This guy, like all bullies, is a coward. He does not want to run against me,"" said Biden of the 73-year-old President Trump. 
Biden calls the pay-to-play allegations in Ukraine unfounded, and said recently that ""this is not about me, this is not about my son.""
Democrats in the bottom tier of the race are taking advantage of Biden's Ukraine problem by keeping their fire trained on Trump.

The nation's largest abortion provider said Wednesday besides defeating Trump, it plans to help abortion rights candidates get elected at the state level and also in the US Senate. 
""Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations are launching their largest-ever electoral effort for the 2020 cycle. We'll fight for our rights and freedoms down the ballot in 2020,"" the organization tweeted.

'Use This Case to Overturn Roe v. Wade': Supreme Court to Hear Louisiana Case, Tackle Abortion for First Time in 3 Years
The news website The Hill reports a ""large-scale grassroots"" effort that includes all forms of media.
It also includes a massive canvassing of 5 million voters and will target key swing states including, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. These states are must-win states for Trump. 
Kelley Robinson of Planned Parenthood Vote told The Hill the stakes are higher than ever.
""We're coming out more powerfully than ever with the largest investment we've ever made,"" Robinson said. 
She also says the campaign will focus on telling people there is a ""coordinated attack"" by Republicans to overturn the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.
The announcement comes after a turbulent year for the abortion provider. 
As CBN News reported in August, Planned Parenthood left the federal family planning program rather than abide by a new Trump administration rule prohibiting participants from referring patients for abortions. This move cost Planned Parenthood $60 million a year in funding. It's clear the abortion provider rejected the Title X funding for one reason: So that it can continue to refer pregnant women for abortions.
Pro-life advocates called the funding cut a win, but they say the decision by the abortion provider exposes their true colors.
Former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson said, ""They don't really care if they don't receive Title 10 money because their primary focus is not women's health care. Their primary focus is abortion.""
In July, the abortion provider removed Dr. Leana Wen as its president, less than a year after she was chosen to lead the organization.
When she was fired Wen said it was because she wanted to shift Planned Parenthood to put women's health first, rather than abortion. 
Wen wrote at the time, ""The new board leadership has determined that the priority of Planned Parenthood moving forward is to double down on abortion rights advocacy.""
Several states also passed bans or restrictions on abortion this year. 
The abortion provider's announcement also comes right after the Supreme Court said it would hear its first abortion case in three years. Court watchers say with the two new conservative justices appointed by President Trump joining the high court, the court's final decision expected next summer could affect abortion access in the US for many years.

The July phone call embarrassed Zelenskiy because it showed him as eager to please Trump and critical of European partners whose support he needs to strengthen Ukraine's economy and to end the conflict with Russia.
Zelenskiy said it was ""wrong"" of the White House to publish a rough transcript of the call and he will not publish the Ukrainian transcript. He said he ""didn't even check"" whether the Ukrainian transcript is the same, but ""I think they match.""
Trump has said the United States has an ""absolute right"" to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases.
Ukraine's top prosecutor last week said his office would review several cases related to the owner of the gas company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden sat on the board. And Zelenskiy on Thursday invited US and Ukrainian prosecutors to cooperate but insisted he would not interfere.
Declaring in a tweet that the Ukrainian president's defense exonerated him, Trump said, ""that should end this Democrat scam, but it won't, because the Dems & media are fixed!""
This news comes as more Americans than ever before support impeachment:
51 percent of all voters in a Fox News poll want President Trump impeached and removed from office. 
40 percent oppose impeachment altogether.
43 percent think what the president said on the phone call with Zelenskiy was an impeachable offense. "

If you watch President Trump's rally there on Thursday, look for Minneapolis police officers standing behind him. They'll be very easy to spot. They'll all be wearing red t-shirts instead of their uniforms due to a brand new department policy. 
So why are the police officers not wearing their uniforms? It all started after Trump announced he would hold the Minneapolis rally, his first campaign event since House Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry against him. The North Star state is expected to be a big battleground in the 2020 presidential campaign. A day after Trump announced the event, a new policy was handed down which bars off-duty police officers from wearing their uniforms to political events.

2nd Trump Whistleblower Comes Forward After Speaking to Inspector General
The head of the local police union immediately cried foul, saying it was a political move by Democrat city officials. 
Police spokesman John Elder told USA Today the new rule was put in place to prevent the department's officers from showing political bias and for the public from becoming ""confused."" 
""The uniform gets translated back to the average person as someone being from the police department,"" he said. ""It's very confusing for people when they see someone in uniform to understand the difference between the city and the federation."" 
But Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis told USA Today it's clear to him that politics are behind the rule change. 
After Trump's rally was announced, Mayor Jacob Frey released a statement in which he called the President's actions ""reprehensible.""
""Under ordinary circumstances, it would be an honor to welcome a sitting President of the United States to Minneapolis and to showcase all our city has to offer on the national stage,"" Frey said in the statement. ""But these aren't ordinary circumstances. Since taking office President Trump's actions have been reprehensible and his rhetoric has made it clear that he does not value the perspectives or rights of Minneapolis' diverse communities.""
Both Frey and Elder said police officials have been working on the rule change for months before Trump announced the Minneapolis rally.
Kroll said the timing of the rule change announcement was ""very conspicuous.""
So police officers who support the president will now wear t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan ""Cops for Trump."" The shirt features an American flag in the shape of Minnesota. All proceeds from the sale of the shirts will go toward the police union's charity. 
President Trump, a big supporter of law enforcement professionals, likes to feature local officers behind him at events. 
Trump tweeted about the shirts and wrote he wants to bring some back to Washington with him.
""Thank you to Lt. Bob Kroll of the great Minneapolis Police Department for your kind words on @foxandfriends. The Police are fighting the Radical Left Mayor and his ridiculous Uniform Ban. Actually, I LOVE the Cops for Trump shirts. Want to bring some home. I am with you 100%!!!!,"" the president tweeted.
Minneapolis city officials also had a few words with the Trump campaign on who was going to cover the costs of the President's rally at the Target Center. 
According to The Washington Post, city officials told the Target Center that it would be responsible for a whopping $530,000 security bill the city says it needs in order to provide security for Trump's visit. 
The arena then threatened to cancel the rally unless the Trump campaign paid the bill. This angered Trump's team which accused Mayor Frey of trying to stop the rally. It was only after the campaign threatened to sue the arena's owners that the bill was rescinded. 
According to The Post, campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote in an email to supporters. ""The Target Center has backed off canceling the contract, which means President Trump's Keep America Great rally will go on as scheduled. Consistent with our original agreement with the venue, the Trump campaign has not agreed to pay any additional funds.""
Trump tweeted, ""Someone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can't price out Free Speech. Probably illegal! I stand strongly & proudly with the great Police Officers and Law Enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota! See you Thursday Night!"

Thousands of evangelicals will be on hand to hear from the Commander-in-Chief at the event run by the conservative Family Research Council. Trump spoke at the event back in 2017 and Vice President Mike Pence addressed the crowd last year.
Typically, when President Trump speaks to evangelical audiences, he receives multiple standing ovations. This Saturday will probably be more of the same because, even with the swirl of impeachment surrounding him, evangelicals have stood solidly behind the president so far. His remarks also come at a time where evangelical leaders have expressed concern about U.S. troop withdrawal from Northeastern Syria. They believe the move by Trump leaves religious minorities in the region, including many Christians, as easy targets for slaughter by the Turkish Government.  
President Trump will have an opportunity to explain his reasoning in front of this all-important voting block.

""Our interest was always and still is trying to help Ukraine become as independent as it can be from an energy standpoint. They've been held hostage by Russians, by Russian gas,"" he explains.
Now comes word from President Trump that the infamous phone call with the Ukrainian president came at Perry's urging.
In a statement to CBN News, Perry's spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes says, ""Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development.""
In our interview, Perry told CBN News he's personally discussed Ukrainian corruption with President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and several ambassadors.
We asked if former Vice President Joe Biden ever factored into his conversations.
""Not once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son - ever mentioned. Corruption was talked about in the country, but it was always a relatively vague term of, you know, the oligarchs and this and that and what have you. But I'm quite comfortable. Matter of fact, I'm extremely comfortable that not once did the president of the United States, or any of his administration or his team ever talk about with the intent there was some quid pro quo,"" he explains.
Instead, he says, the administration is intensely focused on getting Ukraine to clean up its own business culture.
""The message was clear, you clean up the corruption and the United States will be certainly willing to come in and help you. I can't go in good faith and tell a US company, go and invest here, go and be involved if the corruption is ongoing,"" Perry says.
Despite all the scrutiny, the secretary traveled to Lithuania Sunday to meet with Ukrainian and other regional leaders to discuss energy security.
""I think this is obviously the continued attempt to take this president any way they can because they don't like the way the election turned out in 2016,"" he surmises.
Regardless, Perry will likely remain under a microscope for the foreseeable future.

Rick Perry Explains 'Expansive Relationship' With Ukraine: 'God as My Witness Not Once Was Biden Mentioned',"WASHINGTON – When it comes to dealings with Ukraine, Energy Secretary Rick Perry says he probably has the most expansive relationships as any cabinet secretary but says he's never heard former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter come up in conversation. 
Secretary Perry discussed his dealings during an exclusive interview with CBN News Friday.
""This has been a very intense, a very focused push to get Ukraine to clean up the corruption. It's a very well known fact that this was historically a corrupt place and the message was clear: you clean up the corruption and the United States will be certainly willing to come in and help you,"" Perry explained.
""I can't go in good faith and tell a US company, go and invest here, go and be involved if the corruption is ongoing,"" he added.
Perry says he never heard anyone ever bring up former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter.
""I never heard, and I talked to the president about this,"" he told CBN News. ""I had a conversation with - a phone call - with Rudy Guiliani about it. I've talked to the previous ambassador. I've talked to the current ambassador. I've talked to Kurt Volker, Gordan Sondland, the EU ambassador- every name that you've seen out in the media and not once, not once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son ever mentioned. Corruption was talked about in the country but it was always a relatively vague term of, you know, the oligarchs and this and that and what have you.""
Perry said he ""got very comfortable"" that President Volodymyr Zelensky's and his team were committed to cleaning up corruption in their country and helping the county move forward economically.
""Our interest was always and still is trying to help Ukraine become as independent as it can be from an energy standpoint. They've been held hostage by Russians, by Russian gas. The Russians literally have cut the gas off to Ukraine. They have attacked their utilities with cyberattacks,"" he noted.
The House Oversight Committee wants to learn more about Perry's trip to Ukraine for President Zolensky's inauguration, along with other meetings.
The secretary says he'll cooperate fully with Congress.
On Friday, House investigators released dozens of text messages from a diplomat in Ukraine discussing President Trump's request the country launch an investigation into Biden's family. 
The texts suggest Ukraine's new president would get a high profile visit to Washington in return for launching the investigation. 
The latest revelations come as President Trump is now publicly calling on both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden.
Meanwhile, media reports indicate Perry plans to leave his post next month. During the 2016 presidential debates, then-candidate Perry famously called for the elimination of a number of federal agencies including the one he currently runs.
Now nearly three years into the job, Perry says he's grown to view the Department of Energy as an asset to the nation.
""Wisdom comes in a lot of different forms. The Bible tells us that the fear of God is a real form of wisdom and another form of wisdom, I would suggest to you, is learning when you've made a mistake and in this case doing away with the Department of Energy was one of those wise moments for me,"" he explained. ""The reason is, as I came in, as I became very educated about what the agency does, I found an amazing group of men and women, very committed to their roles.""
Perry's impressed that some 40 percent of the agency staff are veterans and now brags on the work they do, especially when it comes to innovation and security.
""There's 17 national labs working on everything from artificial intelligence that's going to have a big impact on our health care system, being able to find cures for cancer, for traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress,"" he listed. ""Just some fascinating work that's being done there because of the supercomputers that we operate. The weapons side of our program. Making sure these weapons are safe, that they're modern. That's a very important role that the department has as well,"" he said.

""Women For Trump"" – that's the motto the campaign is pushing at gatherings across the country designed to mobilize women and promote President Trump's agenda. 
The campaign held 13 of these ""Coast to Coast"" gatherings on one August evening, all of them in battleground states the campaign knows it needs to win and where Republicans lost significant ground in the 2018 midterm elections. 
Gabby Orr, White House reporter for Politico, was the first to report on the story.  
""They're doing a lot behind the scenes,"" Orr told CBN's Faith Nation. ""Their main goal is to bring females who are supportive of the president to campaign events where they can interact with spokespeople for the campaign like Kayleigh McEnany, surrogates who are very pro-Trump – Kellyanne Conway is another one of them – and encourage them to go back to their communities and talk about all of the accomplishments of this administration and communicate to their neighbors, to fellow women, why they think it's worth supporting the president for a second term."" 
Kayleigh McEnany, press secretary for the Trump Campaign says women have benefited greatly under Trump. 
""We have a president, the first Republican president in history, first president of either party, actually to put in his plan paid family leave,"" McEnany said on Faith Nation.
She also pointed to women's unemployment which is at a 65-year low under Trump. 
""The numbers and facts tell the story, so we're trying to blow past the media narrative and get the facts out there to females across the country,"" said McEnany. 
Many of the states eyed by the Trump campaign were won by Democrats in 2018, in large part due to suburban women. Exit polls from CNN found women backed Democrats over Republicans by 19 percent, the largest gap in more than three decades. 
Fast-forward to 2020, where a recent NBC News-Wall Street Journal Poll found a generic Democrat beating Trump by six points among non-college educated white women. That's a demographic he carried by 27 percent in 2016. In that same poll, Trump falls 33 percent behind with college-educated white women. 
Still, McEnany thinks there are quite a few women ""closet voters"" out there. 
""There's still that contingency of hidden Trump voters who many happen to be women, who might not talk to a pollster or talk to the media, but nevertheless, know the president's right for their family and will vote for him,"" she said. 
Closet voters or not, the Trump campaign says another purpose of these ""Coast to Coast"" events is to encourage women who might otherwise be reluctant to publicly declare their support for Trump. "

Rick Perry's Oval Office Prophecy Comes True: 'God Has a Plan, Just Be Faithful'","WASHINGTON – Energy Secretary Rick Perry is having a good day. This afternoon he witnessed the fulfillment of a prophecy in his life, one he wasn't sure would ever come true.
""Fascinating story,"" he tells CBN News during an exclusive interview in Washington Friday morning. 
""In 2011, I was in the process of deciding whether I was going to run for president, and a dear friend of mine, a great Christian brother named Dr. Charles Gordon, said, 'Hey, I had a friend who shared with me a vision of you, a prophecy about you in the White House, in the Oval Office, with your grandson'."" 
At the time Perry's son was married but didn't have any children.
""But I knew I was planning on being the next president of the United States, so shoot, I knew how to take that, right?"" Sec. Perry added with a smile.
But it didn't quite work out that way.
 
""As I tell people if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans,"" he continued.
His 2012 run for the White House fizzled.
""My son in 2013 does have a child. Well, I know it's gonna be a boy, right?"" he says. 
Wrong.
""Out came Ella Perry. And I thought well there's time to have more children. 2015, February, a second child comes. It's Piper, another little girl,"" he says.
And by September of 2015 Perry says he, ""read the tea leaves pretty well"" and realized he wasn't going to be elected president.  
Still, he never forgot that prophecy.
""It never shook my faith, but it was kinda like well, 'you know, maybe this lady was just wrong,' maybe she's not a prophet',"" he recalls.
But then on Independence Day of this year, Perry's long-awaited grandson was born, and today that prophesy from 2011 became truth.
""So, Griffin James Perry, his nickname is Finn, he will go into the White House, into the Oval Office, with the president of the United States,"" Perry says with a smile.
""Your plans often aren't God's plans, but be faithful. His plan's better,"" Perry says.
""Looking back on it, my plan was to be president of the United States. Tried twice. It didn't work out that way. God has a plan. You know, just don't be frustrated. Just be faithful,"" he continues.
And someday when Finn looks back on the photo of he and his grandfather in the Oval Office with the president... ""He'll go, my grandfather, he was a pretty cool guy,"" Perry says.

Luria took a big political risk when she recently called for an impeachment inquiry with six other freshman colleagues. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi officially announced the House would pursue an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump shortly after their op-ed was published. The former Navy commander is back in her district this week seeing how her constituents feel about her bold decision. 
 
""The people who have come up to me have said you know we support you, thank you for being strong, thank you for making a decision because it was the right decision, not because it was a political calculus,"" said Luria Thursday. 
 
Luria tells CBN News 63% of the phone calls to her office have been supportive of her decision.
 
""Whether it has future implications on my election prospects in 2020, I want to be able to look in the mirror and say that I was on the right side of history and not that this has any political ramifications,"" continued Luria. 
 
In the crowd at Thursday's town hall, support for the impeachment inquiry was mixed.

But now there are revelations the whistleblower went to a certain congressman before releasing the complaint.
""We don't call him shifty for nothing,"" President Trump said of House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) Wednesday in the Oval Office.
At the heart of the matter is a CIA officer's whistleblower complaint that Trump pressed Ukraine's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son.
Trump maintains that the transcript of the call is an exoneration.
""Here's where I fooled them,"" Trump said referring to Democrats. ""They never thought I'd release the conversation. They never thought in a million years I'd release the conversation.""
Meanwhile, Democrats say this is no joke.
""We're not fooling around here,"" said Schiff in the news conference with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) where they announced they would subpoena the White House.
There are serious questions surrounding Schiff though after it was reported the whistleblower first went to his office. Namely, what did Schiff know about the complaint and its release? And was this a coordinated effort?
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) tweeted, ""This is a carefully orchestrated plot to overthrow the duly elected President of the United States. We need answers, and we need accountability!""
And conservative radio host Bill Mitchell tweeted, ""So Schiff knew all about the whistleblower complaint despite saying he had been kept in the dark. The plot thickens.""
There are more concerns too that the investigation may now be done largely behind closed doors after Pelosi handed over the investigation to the House Intelligence Committee.
""I think the president knows the argument that can be made against him, and he's scared,"" Pelosi told ABC news in an interview that aired Thursday morning.
Former State Department Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volcker will be deposed in a closed hearing Thursday and more White House officials are being pulled into the controversy with revelations Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and an aide to Vice President Mike Pence were on the call.
At the same time, the State Department's Inspector General turned over documents to key House and Senate committees. Democratic leaders say the packet was full of debunked conspiracy theories, but one report says a Ukrainian prosecutor told Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that he was ordered to back off the investigation into Hunter Biden's involvement in that Ukrainian company.
As to the whistleblower, overnight his lawyer pushed back on the suggestion that he worked with Schiff's office to draft the complaint. In a statement the lawyer says the whistleblower wrote it entirely on his own.

However, religious freedom advocates argue the Trump administration is setting a bad example by deciding to accept fewer refugees than ever.
Just hours after the administration announced it would only accept 18,000 refugees this year, CBN News learned about families set to board planes to the US only to have their dreams dashed at the last moment.
Bethany Christian Services was working with some of those families on the verge of relief.
""They gave everything away that they had at the refugee camp - the pots that they cook with, their extra clothes because they weren't going to need it anymore, they were going to be resettled to the United States and reunified with their family. They slept outside the office that was going to bring them to the airport the next day and when the workers arrived, they had to tell them that their flights were canceled,"" says Nate Bult with Bethany Christian Services.  
Although the numbers fluctuate and have fallen drastically since the program began 40 years ago, the US has never taken in such a small number of refugees.
According to the State Department, 80 percent of the world's people live in countries where their religious freedom is threatened. It's a reality experts say translates into a global refugee crisis.
""What we're seeing is people fleeing oppressive countries and needing to resettle in a safe place,"" says NadineMaenza, a commissioner on the US Commission for International Religious Freedom.
She says Americans often confuse the chaos at the southern border with refugees.
""A refugee is somebody who can't go back. The conditions are so bad for them - if they go back it won't be safe for them,"" Maenza tells CBN News.
Advocates say refugees resettled in the US aren't living off US taxpayers. In the long run, they end up paying significantly more in taxes than the cost of assistance.
""When a refugee is resettled to the United States, they have 90 days to not only survive in the United States, but to thrive and provide for their families. After that US government assistance is cut off and they must have jobs and be contributing taxpayers back to the economy,"" Bult tells CBN News.
And while advocates say no White House has been stronger on religious freedom than that of President Trump's, United Nations data shows when the US takes fewer refugees, other countries follow its lead, and that troubles many evangelicals.
""Christ is very clear - especially in his parable about the good Samaritan - about what the obligations of his followers are, and it's to welcome the stranger, to welcome a neighbor,"" Bult says.
Some observers fear the administration's low refugee admissions will cause the dismantling of the US refugee program.
""I've been told by people in the industry that it does dismantle the infrastructure. So, I do think it will be costlier to build back up again if we decide that we're going to accept additional refugees,"" Maenza explains.
In the coming year, religious freedom advocates hope the administration realizes it can address illegal immigration while also extending a hand to refugees desperate for a safe place to live."

Some of the Democrats 2020 candidates released their third-quarter numbers on Tuesday.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) tops the list pulling in $25.3 million from about 1.4 million donors. The Vermont senator says he's now collected $61.5 million from 3.3 million individual donors since launching his White House bid in February, making his average contribution $19.
Indianapolis Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised $19.1 million, which is about $5 million less than what he raised in the second quarter.
California Sen. Kamala Harris has raised $11.6 million in the past three months, a sum that leaves her trailing several rivals in the Democratic presidential primary's money race.
Sen. Cory Booker raised more than $6 million over the last three months, with a third of that coming in the past 10 days after he warned he would have to drop out of the Democratic presidential race if he didn't take in more cash by Monday's fundraising deadline.
Republicans reportedly have raised $15 million in the wake of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.  The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign have raised $210 million since the beginning of the year.

Employees in Impeachment Inquiry,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is vowing to block efforts by Congress to 'bully' State Department officials into testifying about President Trump's Ukraine phone call.
He accuses House Democrats of trying to 'intimidate' State Department officials, saying the way Congress made the request was as ""an act of intimidation"" which violated constitutional separation of powers.
""They contacted State Department employees directly, told them not to contact legal counsel at the State Department. That's been reported to us. They said that the State Department wouldn't be able to be present,"" he said.
Pompeo is pushing back on efforts to depose former and current State Department officials by committees involved in the impeachment inquiry into his boss President Trump. 
The secretary tweeted that he's ""concerned with aspects"" of requests ""that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly distinguished professionals of the Department of State.""
He also added. 
""Let me clear: I will not tolerate such tactics. I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.""
Two of those State Department employees will meet privately with the committee. Kurt Volker, the former envoy to Ukraine, is scheduled to testify Thursday.
It's reported Pompeo listened in on that July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where Trump asked for help to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Wednesday Pompeo confirmed that he was in fact on the call.
President Trump was also on the defense Tuesday reiterating that his call with Ukraine was 'perfect,' 'nice and warm'.
The commander-in-chief's personal lawyer also faces scrutiny and a subpoena.
Democrats want Rudy Giuliani to turn over any Ukraine-related documents after he was implicated in the whistleblower complaint 30 times. It's unclear if he'll comply. 
""I don't know. I'm weighing the alternatives,"" Giuliani said. ""I'll kind of go through it. I'll get all my evidence together.  I'll get my shards.""
The president was back on Twitter Tuesday calling the entire ordeal ""just another Democrat hoax!"""

Whistleblower Report Released, Trump Team Blasts Democrats for Impeachment 'Hysteria'
Trump attorney Jay Sekulow says the intelligence community recently changed whistleblower rules before the allegations against Trump were submitted, saying up until recently the whistleblower complaint required ""first-hand"" information, but the whistleblower in this case only revealed ""second-hand"" information. In legal terms, that's called ""hearsay.""
The Federalist has confirmed what Sekulow said, explaining, ""Hearsay is generally inadmissible as evidence in U.S. federal and state courts since it violates the constitutional requirement that the accused be given the opportunity to question his accusers.""
""It's all hearsay, you can't get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay,"" Trump friend and ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said in an interview with CBS.  
The complaint against President Trump says he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter's dealings in Ukraine.
President Trump's former Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said he's troubled by the call. ""It is a bad day and a bad week for this president and for this country if he is asking for political dirt on an opponent,"" Bossert told ABC This Week.
Meanwhile, Democratic members of the House have launched a slew of subpoenas against the State Department and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
 
They also say they may need to hear from Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani who is mentioned a number of times in the complaint. He says he may talk to Congress but will not speak to Rep. Adam Schiff, saying he would rather speak to someone who isn't prejudiced. Schiff chairs the House Intel Committee and has been leading the case for impeachment.
""I have to imagine they are going to fight us tooth and nail and yet even as they do the more they fight to try to prevent the lawful functions of Congress the more they are going to make a case for impeachment on obstruction of justice,"" Schiff told NBC's Meet the Press.  
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has this message for the White House. ""Speak the truth and let us work together to have this be a unifying experience not a dividing one for our country,"" Pelosi told CBS' 60 Minutes.
Recent polling shows the country is already divided with support increasing for an impeachment inquiry, mostly among Democrats and independents. But Trump supporters aren't buying it.
Pastor Robert Jeffress told Fox News, ""The Democrats don't care if they burn down and destroy this nation in the process. I have never seen the Evangelical Christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this President from office, overturn the 2016 election, and negate the votes of millions of Evangelicals in the process."" Trump tweeted out what Jeffress said:
Meanwhile, the Biden campaign sent a letter to the major news networks calling on them to stop having Giuliani on their shows, claiming he's spreading ""debunked conspiracy theories."""

However, newly uncovered documents conflict with the story Biden tells about the pressure he put on Ukraine while he was vice president.
On the Democratic side, the agenda is clear. ""If there were any doubt about the need for impeachment proceeding, there's none now,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told reporters on Capitol Hill.
Republicans want to know more about the whistleblower and point out the complaint is only based on secondhand knowledge.
 
""When I think of whistleblower complaints, I generally think of someone with firsthand knowledge of the events in question,"" tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).
During his testimony before Congress, the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire also emphasized the complaint was ""hearsay"" and ""not corroborated by other folks.""
The president expressed a similar sentiment in audio leaked to the Los Angeles Times.
""Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call. He never saw the call,"" the president said during a private event.
Meanwhile, the Ukraine issue again raises questions about Joe Biden's push to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired while he was vice president. 
Biden insists he wanted Viktor Shokin gone because he was corrupt, not because he was investigating Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian company that happened to employ his son Hunter at the time. However, a newly uncovered sworn affidavit tells another story. 
""In that statement, Mister Shokin swears under oath he was told he was fired because he refused to drop the Burisma investigation and it made Mister Biden, the vice president, unhappy,"" The Hill Vice President John Solomon told Sean Hannity on Fox News Thursday.
Heading into an election year, the big question is what do voters think about a push for impeachment?
A new Quinnipiac University Poll shows a clear majority of Americans, 57 percent, do not think the president should be impeached and removed from office. "

Breaking Down the Whistleblower Complaint into Bite-Sized Pieces
""The president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""
While treason and bribery seem relatively clear cut, the phrase ""other high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not.
That leads to serious questions about what constitutes an impeachable offense. 
Thomas Jipping, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation explained it for CBN News. ""It is a little bit of an odd phrase, and those words might mean something to people today - they might hear the word misdemeanor and think that it's a minor, little offense. But it's a phrase that's been around in the law both here and in England for a few hundred years actually.""
""It identifies a category, a very narrow category of serious misconduct by a public official. Not necessarily criminal, but in a sense it's an offense against the public trust, it's an offense against the political system, it's kind of a betrayal of the people in such a way that that official ought to be removed now."" 
""In the case of the president, it'd be like saying he's gotta go now instead of waiting for next year's election. So it's a narrow category of very serious offenses,"" Jipping explained.
Impeachment Is a Political Process
The US Supreme Court has declared that impeachment is a political process, not a legal process. Heritage explains it this way:
""The most important point to understand about impeachment is that it is not a legal proceeding like a federal criminal prosecution. And none of the formal procedural or evidentiary rules that apply to both criminal and civil trials in the federal courts are applicable in an impeachment trial.""
In other words, the political party that's in control of the House can determine how it wants to proceed and what it considers to be treason-worthy.
Before receiving the record of the White House phone call, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated she's already made up her mind, saying the president's actions have seriously violated the Constitution. Jipping says that's a surprising conclusion at this stage in the process.
""I was a little bit confused by her press conference because, on the one hand, she's trying to explain why now she supports an impeachment inquiry when before she didn't. And so she's saying we need to investigate, we need to get the facts. And on the other hand she (reaches) an explicit conclusion about the entire matter. She can't have it both ways.""

Whistleblower Report Released, Trump Team Blasts Democrats for Impeachment 'Hysteria'
'No Quid Pro Quo' in Trump Transcript of Call with Ukraine President: Here's What It Reveals
On Wednesday, the White House released an unredacted transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky. It reveals Trump encouraged Ukraine's president to work with Attorney General William Barr and Rudy Giuliani to investigate whether Joe Biden had interfered with a Ukrainian investigation of Hunter Biden, his son.
The unnamed whistleblower then accuses the White House of attempting to conceal records of that conversation.
""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple US officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all the records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House situation room.""
The whistleblower goes on to say the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.
The whistleblower even alleges this has happened before, writing:
 
""According to White House officials I spoke with, this was 'not the first time' under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into the codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive – rather than national security sensitive – information.""
President Trump was fired up after the US intel chief fielded questions from lawmakers Thursday on the whistleblower complaint.
""My call was perfect, the president of the Ukraine said yesterday there was no pressure put on him whatsoever, none whatsoever and he said it loud and clear for the press,"" Trump said. ""What these guys are doing, Democrats, are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn't be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts.""
President Trump repeatedly tried to dismiss the significance of the phone call with Ukraine's president saying there was ""no pressure"" on their part. Yes, the President did withhold military aid from Ukraine, but not on that phone call. He insists that move was not an attempt to put pressure on Ukraine's president.

FAITHWIRE  International Christian Ministry Fights Back After Liberal Non-Profit Labels Them ‘Hate Group’
The hearing, which met on the topic of “How The Tax Code Subsidizes Hate,” was held by Democrats hoping to end the tax-exempt law for some organizations they consider hateful, as defined by the controversial Southern Poverty Law Center.
While House Republicans argued that Democrats picking and choosing which groups received tax-exempt status infringes on First Amendment rights, the Democrats contend that Americans deserve to know where their money is going, and claimed if taxpayers were to learn it has been going to these so-called “hate groups,” they will not be happy.
“It’s unacceptable that your money continues to help propagate hatred from groups like these,” the Ways and Means Committee tweeted.
The subcommittee allowed visitors to share personal stories in regards to these hate groups, each asking congress to strip various organizations of their tax-exempt status.
The list includes organizations like the Family Research Council, Federation for American Immigration Reform, American Family Association, and D. James Kennedy Ministries, just to name a few.
Each group is designated as a “hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an organization that has both an anti-Christian background and controversial leadership.
Over the past year, the SPLC leadership has faced intense scrutiny over serious sexual assault allegations, along with racial discrimination in the workplace, as the New Yorker reported.
FAITHWIRE  ‘Nothing More Than a Weapon of the Radical Left’: SPLC Given an ‘F’ by Charity Watch
Amid the allegations, the group’s co-founder Morris Dees was fired and the SPLC President, Richard Cohen, was forced to step down as well.
As previously reported by Faithwire, SPLC has a history of combative behavior towards Christian and conservative groups. In April 2019, a group of Christian and conservative leaders signed a letter asking CEOs of companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon to cut ties with SPLC.
“It is now clear that the SPLC has proven to be a hate-filled, anti-Christian, anti-conservative organization and nothing more than a weapon of the radical left, whose goal is to bully people into compliance with their ideology,” the letter stated. “Fail to comply with their demands, and you will be labeled as a hate group or an extremist.”
The SPLC defines hate groups as those which “have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics,” which appears to include supporting a traditional or Biblical view of marriage, and immigration reform that increases border and national security.
In the past, they have targeted groups like Alliance Defending Freedom, the Family Research Council, and Prager University for conservative and/or Christian ideology.
They’ve done “nothing but demean, smear, and attack its opponents,” says Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, who is individually listed on the SPLC hate-list. “They claim that they’re trying to promote tolerance when they’re completely intolerant of people with an alternative point of view,” he continued, adding that his organization is seeking out an IRS investigation of SPLC’s tax-exempt status.
According to the Center for Immigration Studies last year, the SPLC was reported to have more than half a billion dollars in assets, “putting tens of millions in tax havens.”

But the report also reveals that multiple individuals within the US government and White House revealed information to the whistleblower, and Brody says Trump supporters will point to that as clear evidence of a ""deep state"" conspiracy. Calling these numerous internal sources ""tentacles"", Brody says the White House will say ""this has deep state all over it.""

The President took the extraordinary and transparent steps of releasing the full, unredacted, and declassified transcript of his call with President Zelenskyy, which forms the heart of the complaint, as well as the complaint itself.  That is because he has nothing to hide. The White House will continue to push back on the hysteria and false narratives being peddled by Democrats and many in the main stream media, and President Trump will continue to work hard on behalf of the American people as he always does."" 
READ the Whistleblower Report Here
The case has convinced more Democrats to join in the calls for impeachment while most Republicans are coming to Trump's defense.
""I found the allegations deeply disturbing, I also found them very credible,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters after he and members of the House Intelligence Committee read the whistleblower complaint Wednesday evening.
Hours earlier, the White House released the transcript of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Democrats insist there was quid pro quo or pay to play. Most Republicans though say there's no smoking gun, pointing out that the president never threatened to withhold anything from Ukraine in that phone call.
""To impeach any president over a phone call would be insane,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters.
The transcript shows President Trump asking President Zelensky to ""look into"" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's actions as vice president that allegedly might have helped his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine. Trump also asks Zelensky to work with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and US Attorney General Bill Barr.
But Zelensky says he wasn't pressured.
""I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky said sitting next to Trump Wednesday afternoon at the United National General Assembly in New York.
The Justice Department says Trump and the attorney general never spoke about the call and Barr never contacted Ukraine.
""You take a look at that call and it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo,"" said Trump in a speech to the UN.  
Still, for the first time, the majority of the House of Representatives, which is run by the Democrats, now supports an impeachment inquiry.
William Ricciardella with the Washington Examiner told CBN News it's all political.
""Nothing came out here. Now you have Democrats in a frenzy. They're doubling down on the impeachment inquiry. They really have no choice. They can't come out and say, hey we were wrong about the transcript,"" he told CBN's Newswatch program. ""This is all political. It looks like it was political from the beginning and seems it's going to continue that way.""
Today, the acting director of national intelligence is testifying before Congress about his handling of the whistleblower complaint.

The Trump administration is trying to de-classify the report so they can hand it to Congress, hoping it will help prove the president's innocence. But how does the whistleblower process actually work?
First, a whistleblower complaint is sent to the Inspector General. In this case, the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) who reviews and investigates the complaint.
The ICIG gives a copy of the complaint and his determination about its credibility to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).
After the whistleblower complaint and the ICIG's report, the DNI has seven days to report it to Congress. 
The Whistleblower Protection Act allows whistleblowers to go directly to Congressional intelligence committees to report an ""urgent concern,"" defined as, among other things, a ""serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of law or Executive order, or deficiency"" but they're obliged to obey directions from the DNI so their complaint remains secure.
In this case, involving President Trump, once the DNI realized the complaint was about the president, he sought guidance from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which advised him the complaint about the president's communications with a foreign leader was covered by executive privilege. Within the executive branch, OLC opinions are considered to be binding.

Critics of the impeachment effort say the transcript does not show any evidence of a quid pro quo suggestion by the president. Trump opponents have accused him of withholding aid to Ukraine in order to force the new Ukrainian president to carry out some investigations, but the phone call does not confirm that accusation.
Charlie Cook, a well-known neutral political analyst, writes that the transcript provides no evidence to help the Democrats in their effort to unseat Trump:

Whistleblower Report Released, Trump Team Blasts Democrats for Impeachment 'Hysteria'
""I don’t Tweet very much but reading transcript has moved me to comment. I was totally underwhelmed by the transcript. After the build-up, it was not much more inappropriate said than we hear from him in a typical week. This will not move malleable voters.""
The transcript shows Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election, specifically asking if a Democratic server that Russia hacked may have been based in Ukraine.
He also asks the president to consider looking into reports that former Vice President Joe Biden may have stepped in to quash a Ukrainian investigation into Biden's son who was working at a Ukrainian energy company.
Here are a few of the top quotes from President Trump during the phone call, related the Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and Joe Biden's involvement with Ukraine, according to the transcript:
""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation .. I think you're surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it's very important that you do it if that's possible.
""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. … It sounds horrible to me.""

His remarks come as tensions flare in the Middle East over the recent attack on Saudi oil facilities.

Dems Drum Up More Impeachment Threats Over Trump's Conversations With Ukrainian Leader
Faith Nation Roundtable: Warren's Rising Poll Numbers, Democrats 'Whistleblower' Case, and Trump Calls Out Religious Persecution at UN
""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump tweeted. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!""
Pelosi had been demanding the administration release the whistleblower report and the private phone conversation between President Trump and the president of Ukraine. Trump's response has been clear, arguing he did nothing wrong.
""It's just a Democrat witch-hunt. Here we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with everything, and now they're bringing this up,"" Trump told reporters Monday.
A new Washington Post report alleges that Trump ordered aides to freeze millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine days before he spoke with the country's president.
The report cites an administration official who says the freeze was out of concerns of corruption in Ukraine, and Senate Republicans who said Trump was trying to determine if the new president was pro-West or pro-Russia.
Democrats think the president offered to release the aid, only if Ukraine launched a corruption investigation into Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's involvement in a Ukrainian energy company.
""I put no pressure on them. I think it probably, possibly could have been OK if I did, but I didn't put any pressure on them whatsoever,"" Trump said in response to the allegations.
""There's a difference between Donald Trump telling the Ukrainian president, 'Hey you might want to look at Joe Biden.' It's another thing to say, 'You better look at Joe Biden and if not we have a few hundreds of millions of dollars of aid,'"" CBN News Chief Political Analyst David Brody said on Faith Nation.
In an op-ed published in the Washington Post late Monday, seven freshman Democrat lawmakers who served in the military and national security said that if the allegation against Trump is true, it's impeachable. These Democrats hold sway with House leadership because many of them are from Republican-held districts where Trump has been popular, and have so far been against impeachment.
Republicans say they don't have enough information yet and point to the allegations against Joe Biden's actions as Vice President when his son worked with a Ukrainian company that was under scrutiny by a government prosecutor. 
""What's Hunter Biden doing on the board of directors of a major Ukraine natural gas company? And did his dad call off or ask to have the prosecutor call off in a way that would inure to the benefit of his company? I don't know, I just think it all looks bad, all of it,"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) said.
Speaker Pelosi set a deadline for Thursday to receive the whistleblower report, promising new investigations if it's not handed over."

The president says it's just more fake news.
Trump admits he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden with the Ukrainian president but denies any wrongdoing.
Democrats say there's only one way to find out; release the transcripts of that phone call.
""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory…was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son adding to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" said Trump.  
The Trump administration is defending the July 25th conversation in which the Wall Street Journal says Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian president about eight times to investigate political rival Biden.
President Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani accuse the former VP of working to get rid of a Ukrainian prosecutor who reportedly was looking into a company where Biden's son Hunter served as a board member.
""Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum. And he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" retorted Biden.  
The president is defending that conversation in a tweet, calling the report a media con job and saying there was no pressure.
The Ukrainian foreign minister is also coming to Trump's defense over that phone call.
The incident coincides with a whistleblower complaint that reportedly involves Trump's phone calls with a foreign leader.
An inspector general for the Director of National Intelligence called that complaint ""urgent"" but Democrats have not been able to obtain the complaint from the administration. They want to see if the two incidents are connected.
Democrats accuse the president of offering a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians and that impeachment may be the only solution.
""If the president is trying to withhold foreign aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit…then that may be the only remedy,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told CNN.  
That same Wall Street Journal story says there was no mention of money or a quid pro quo and administration officials say it's unlikely.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has always been lukewarm on that idea of impeachment but she is giving the administration until Thursday to turn over that whistleblower complaint or face more investigations."

The goal is to get Christians across America more engaged in the political process – 90 million Christians in America are eligible to vote, but as many as 40 million fail to vote in Presidential election cycles. And 15 million are not even registered to vote, according to the My Faith Votes website.  
Jason Yates, CEO of My Faith Votes, appeared on Thursday's edition of CBN News' Faith Nation to talk about the event.
Some people say churches should stay out of politics, but Yates says Christians should be involved in the political process.
""Our honorary national chairman is Mike Huckabee and I asked him that same question recently and what he said to me was, 'Do you do your dishes? Because if you don't do your dishes and you just turn your back on it the stack of dishes is only going to grow and the stench from all your dirty dishes is only going to grow, so what you've gotta do is roll up your sleeves and do the dishes.'

We have to bring the good of our faith, the values of our faith into the election process, into the civic square.""

The White House says 47 percent of America's homeless population is located in the Golden State alone. 
One issue according to the administration is a lack of affordable housing in the state.
Although it's unclear how the government would fix the issue, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson says all options are on the table.  He's calling on all levels of government to work together with advocates, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and advocacy groups.
On Monday, the same day President Trump visited Los Angeles, Carson got a first-hand look at LA's Skid Row. The latest count showed the homeless population rising to more than 36,000 and they're not only located downtown but throughout various parts of the city.
""Well, you know, I am a Christian,"" Carson told the assembled media. ""I believe in the Bible and there are a lot of verses in the Bible about our obligation to the poor.  And that coupled with my own experience and recognizing that there is a pathway out.""
One option floated by Carson is using vacant federal buildings in California as homeless shelters. 
""It's a severe crisis in L.A. and in many parts of California because it's not just a fact that people are out on the street, but you know there's feces on the street, there are all kinds of health hazards there. And this could really blow up into a major epidemic. So we need to do something,"" said Carson on Fox News @ Night Tuesday. 
Carson told the network the president wants to investigate a range of options, including policing and mental health.
""We must understand that as a nation we have failed a lot of the mentally incapable people by just throwing them out and not supporting them,"" Carson continued. ""Some people think that that's compassion. But that's not compassion at all. We have to really begin to work with the American Psychiatric Association and some others in terms of what kinds of programs are going to work for these individuals,"" he said.
Returning from California on Tuesday, President Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One about California's problem with homelessness.
""We can't let Los Angeles, San Francisco, and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what's happening,"" he said. "

Right now, he's got a different mission to fulfill.
If he ever does run, Lindell would follow in the foosteps of other non-politicians in his home state of Minnesota. Former pro-wrestler Jesse Ventura was governor and comedian Al Franken of Saturday Night Live fame served as US senator.  
""We're a mess in Minnesota,"" Lindell said jokingly.

‘I Was an...Addict’: Inside My Pillow Inventor Mike Lindell’s Amazing Transformation
From Crack Addict to CEO
Appearing on the CBN News Channel program The Global Lane, Lindell said a lot of people have asked if he would consider entering politics.
""If God had me run for something, I would do it in a heartbeat. But right now I want to keep backing the greatest president we have ever had in history,"" he insisted.
Lindell has come under fire for supporting Donald Trump. Leftwing groups like Moveon.org have launched on-line petition boycotts of My Pillow for supporting what they say are the ""racist, sexist and homophobic policies "" of President Trump.
Global Lane host Gary Lane said some people wonder how Lindell could say such a thing about Trump. ""Some Americans would say you're still smoking crack - the best president in the history of America?""
""I can say that because when I came out of crack addiction I had never voted. I didn't know a liberal from a conservative. I had a clean slate. It's like a child growing into something going, 'where are all our values and what's going on,'"" Lindell explained. ""When I came out of addiction I saw our country, a president giving away money to evil empires (Iran), I heard of a thing called ISIS, all my friends were unemployed. I was going, 'What happened here?'""
Lindell first met Donald Trump when he ran for president in 2016. He says when he talked to Trump's employees, they spoke fondly of their boss.
""Every one of them was like talking to one of my employees. They all had something very good to say about him, that he's an amazing guy, he's an amazing boss and he's so smart,"" Lindell recalled. ""I'm reading him and I'm going, 'wow, this guy has absolutely no agenda other than to help our country and he genuinely cares about individuals.'""
Lindell says it's all about results, arguing that Trump has improved the lives of Americans.
He wants to help the president remain in office so he may continue helping the country. He intends to campaign for Trump in as many Minnesota cities as he can in hopes of turning the ""Star of the North"" state red. In 2016, Trump lost Lindell's home state by only 44,600 votes.  
""I've always said everybody loves our president - some just don't know it yet...if you shut off the news I tell them look around you, are you better off? And they all say yes.""    
Lindell says he will donate proceeds from his soon to be released book, What are the Odds: From Crack Addict to CEO to help drug addicts overcome their addictions.
In the meantime, he urges people suffering from addiction to seek a faith-based treatment center and to seek out former addicts who have overcome their addictions. Lindell says it's important to give people common hope. His hope comes from faith in God.
""I have listened to God for what I am supposed to do and we just keep getting rewarded and rewarded.""
My Pillow started with only five employees in 2004. Today, the company employs 1,500 workers and has sold more than 40-million pillows.
 
The ""My Pillow Guy"" says he'll keep sharing his success story with people in Minnesota and around the world.
""My story gives people hope, but maybe not a 22-year-old opiate addict, but I might give a lot of 58-year-old crack addicts hope. People say to me, 'Mike, what's your best day ever in My Pillow?' The day we're sitting in.""

He will be hosting and speaking at the Global Call to Protect Religious Freedom event next Monday. Vice President Mike Pence will also be there. 
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham says, ""The President will call on the international community to take concrete steps to prevent attacks against people on the basis of their religion or beliefs and to ensure the sanctity of houses of worship and all public spaces for all faiths.""
Since he became president, Trump has held multiple events where he has personally highlighted the plight of religious persecution victims. Just a few months ago, he spent over an hour listening to stories from survivors in the Oval Office. 
""Each of you has suffered tremendously for your faith,"" the president said to them back in July. ""You've endured harassment, threats, attacks, trials, imprisonment, and torture.  I got to know many of you and helped you get some — get some of you out of the difficult situation that you were in.  I'm very proud of you in the way you've reacted to a different life.  It is a tremendous thing.""
President Trump has made protecting religious freedom a major priority in his administration. He said he would do so during the 2016 presidential campaign and has taken plenty of steps to make good on that promise. One of his Executive Orders relaxes IRS enforcement on churches that engage in political speech and activities. 
In addition, for the last two years, the State Department hosted the groundbreaking Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom that brought in religious leaders around the world in an attempt to look for ways to combat religious persecution and discrimination around the world.
President Trump has also focused heavily on religious freedom during the National Day of Prayer events at the White House.  Rose Garden ceremonies have been filled with individuals and groups who have been targeted in lawsuits for standing up for their faith. Some have been targets of violence because of their faith. This past May, he brought Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein up to the presidential podium. He was one of the victims of a weekend gun rampage at a synagogue in Poway, California. After his remarks, Trump made him a promise. 
""We will fight with all of our strength and everything that we have in our bodies to defeat anti-Semitism, to end the attacks on the Jewish people, and to conquer all forms of persecution, intolerance, and hate…Every citizen has the absolute right to live according to the teachings of their faith and the convictions of their heart,"" the president said. ""This is the bedrock of American life."""

She appeared on Tuesday's edition of CBN News' Faith Nation to discuss the latest allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
There's a new call to impeach Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass) introduced a House resolution on Tuesday to bring an inquiry on the issue.  
It comes in the wake of new allegations of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh's college days – allegations the alleged victim doesn't even recall.

Critics Say NY Times Built a Fake New Kavanaugh Bombshell by Omitting Key Details
It all began over the weekend after the New York Times published new allegations of sexual assault against him.
But now, the Times has seriously revised its original report. Their original story left out a major fact – that the supposed victim doesn't confirm the accusation against Kavanaugh.
According to a new book by a pair of Times reporters, a Yale classmate by the name of Max Stier – who worked to defend President Clinton during legal battles in the 1990s – approached the FBI during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to say he witnessed Kavanaugh sexually assault a fellow classmate. But the problem is – Stier has never spoken publicly about the allegation or tried to contact the Senate Judiciary Committee with his allegation.
According to Commentary Magazine, Sen. Chuck Grassley's (R-Iowa) office ""has no record of Stier reaching out with his allegation.""
Stier's NY Times accusation is similar to another made by Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that was brought up during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.
Grassley tweeted, ""despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement.""
""The committee's review found no verifiable evidence to support the claims. The @nytimes' own reporting at the time noted that it couldn't find anyone with firsthand knowledge & that Ms. Ramirez told friends she couldn't be sure Kavanaugh was involved:
Throughout the course of that emotional Fall 2018 process, Kavanaugh was accused of assault by three women, accusations he vehemently denied.
""I have never sexually assaulted anyone. Not in high school, not in college, not ever,"" Kavanaugh testified last year.
Ramirez was contacted by the FBI but according to the Times' original report, this alleged victim was not. That prompted some Democrats to demand impeachment.  
But it turns out the Times report that prompted all that Democrat outrage wasn't entirely truthful. Now, in a revised version of that report, the Times says the alleged victim declined an interview and friends say she does not recall the incident at all.  
A Hit Job That Omitted Key Facts
Perhaps the final nail in the coffin of Democrats impeachment calls against Kavanaugh will be driven home by NPR's Hanna Rosin, who notes in her review of Pogrebin's and Kelly's book: 
""In the end, they turn up no smoking gun, no secret confession, no friend who comes forth to say Kavanaugh was lying all this time."" 
Ironically, it will appear in next Sunday's New York Times Book Review.
The National Review's John McCormack writes, ""Omitting this fact from the New York Times story is one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory.""
""I think this is the New York Times being bitter-enders,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told ABC's ""This Week."" ""At some point, they just have to let the anger go and recognize that the democratic process actually moves on.""
President Trump asked if the Times had a fact-checker in place. 
""I think The New York Times made another terrible mistake. It's a shame that a thing like that could happen — I see that they're making a big correction today,"" Trump said. ""They just announced there's a correction, but to do that about a Supreme Court justice is a terrible thing. It's a false accusation. Whatever happened with The New York Times, I mean, I can tell you personally that they never check … they used to have a thing called fact-checking — they don't do fact-checking anymore.""
The president previously suggested the newspaper should be sued for libel over the accusation.
Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Senate majority leader, said this is more than just the left's obsession with one man.
""On the basis of this flimsy uncorroborated story, they're calling for Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh to be impeached,"" McConnell said. ""It would be a mistake to dismiss this as a bad case of sour grapes. This is not just a left-wing obsession with one man. It's part of a deliberate effort to attack judicial independence.""
Carrie Severino is the chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network. She co-wrote the book Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court about the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh. She told CBN News' Faith Nation on Tuesday this is just more out of the same playbook that we saw last year.
""We want people to understand. This is not just coming out of the blue,"" Severino explained. ""We knew there would be another attempt to smear a Supreme Court nominee or justice. We just didn't know it would be Justice Kavanaugh again. We thought maybe the next nominee.""

Rep. Jackie Walorski, who represents South Bend, Indiana where the abortionist had his Women's Pavilion clinic, was first to demand a federal investigation when the news of the discovery broke Saturday morning. In a statement released to the press, Walorski said, ""There could be Indiana aborted babies in those jars in this guy's house...This is sick.""
But another prominent politician in the area has thus far – at this writing – had nothing to say about the grisly revelations at the abortionist's home. According to Real Clear Politics (RCP), Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg, has been silent on the grisly discovery, and RCP has no luck getting a response from him despite repeated attempts.

Buttigieg is a strong supporter of abortion rights, even up to the birth date of the baby. He appeared to justify late-term abortion recently saying that life begins ""at breath."" 
He was the mayor of South Bend for about five years while Klopfer's Women's Pavilion Clinic did business there. The clinic closed in 2016 under state investigation, and Klopfer had his medical license suspended that year as well for several violations including not notifying authorities properly, not giving pain medication to all women, except those under age 16 and those who could pay more, and not having qualified staff to monitor those he did sedate. 
Another abortion clinic called Whole Women's Health sprang up to replace it, employing some of the same staff that had been employed at Klopfer's Women's Pavilion, prompting one doctor to say the new clinic had the ""same kind of profile as Dr. Klopfer's.""
Congressman Jim Banks of Fort Wayne, in a series of tweets, blasted Mayor Pete for his support of the local abortion industry, and targeted his veto of a zoning measure in 2018 that would have allowed Women's Care Center, a pro-life pregnancy center, to locate next door to the Women's Health abortion clinic. 
According to tweets reported by the Daily Caller, Banks said by his veto Buttigieg  ""opposed options"" that would have ""provided an alternative to the direct descendant (Whole Women's Health) of Ulrich Klopfer's house of horrors.""
""To this day,"" Banks tweeted, ""Mayor Pete seems proud he supported Whole Women's Health with ""the same kind of profile as Dr. Klopfer's."" His national press secretary recently touted it in an interview with the Chicago Tribune.""
He went on to say ""This is especially troubling now that we've learned what kind of monster Dr. Klopfer really was.""
Banks told the Daily Caller, ""I support a federal investigation into Dr. Klopfer's crimes. We need to determine how Dr. Klopfer was able to get away with this for so long, and how we only know about it now that Dr. Klopfer is deceased."" 
The horrific discovery in Klopfer's home makes the Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains signed by Governor Mike Pence in 2016 seem amazingly prescient. But if all that's come to light means more government regulation and increased scrutiny of abortion clinics, Mayor Pete opposes it. At least he has in the past.
""The mayor is deeply concerned by what he views as a new and extreme assault on Roe v. Wade in legislatures across the country,"" Buttigieg spokesman Chris Meagher told the Chicago Tribune in August and reported by Real Clear Politics. ""He believes that the truly radical idea in this debate and around abortion care is one of banning abortion outright.""
The question to Mayor Buttigieg and other abortion supporters now is – without that increased scrutiny, how can another Klopfer be prevented? "

The hearing quickly turned hostile as Lewandowski, the only witness scheduled to testify before the committee, refused to answer most of the committee's questions, saying they were ""focusing on petty and personal politics.""
He was following White House orders not to discuss confidential conversations with the president beyond what was already public in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

House Dems Pass Resolution on Impeachment Guidelines in Fiery Hearing, Republicans Say It's Misleading
Anything New or Replaying the Past? Mueller to Give Testimony Before Two House Committees Wednesday
As the hearing began, Lewandowski – a devoted friend and supporter of the Republican president – demanded that Democrats provide him a copy of the report, sending Democratic staff scrambling to find one. Lewandowski then just read directly from report, making it clear that he wouldn't say much beyond what Mueller wrote.
Republicans on the panel then forced a series of procedural votes, immediately sending the hearing into disarray.
""You're not going to stonewall me and my questioning!"" Rep. David Cicilline, (D-RI), told Lewandowski. He also suggested that the committee hold him in contempt of Congress.
""He's filibustering,"" said a frustrated House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, (D-NY), who also said he would consider the idea.
Lewandowski tweeted before the hearing: ""Excited about the opportunity to remind the American people today there was no collusion no obstruction... There were lots of angry Democrats who tried to take down a duly elected President. Tune in. #Senate2020.""
The hearings will focus on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, which Lewandowski helped to run.
The Judiciary panel accepted rules for impeachment hearings last week. This allows witnesses to be questioned at those hearings and gives the committee access to documents in executive sessions.
The Republican Senate is certain to defeat any House efforts to bring charges against Trump if Democrats should proceed with an official impeachment effort. 
CBN News previously reported that the Justice Department released a partially redacted version of the report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It says right off the top, ""The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion,"" but the Trump campaign wasn't part of that effort.
The report clearly states, ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" 
Trump insists his team cooperated fully with the investigation which found no evidence of collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. 
Two other White House aides were subpoenaed, along with Lewandowski, but they won't appear before the committee on orders from the administration.
Mueller testified before Congress this summer where Democrats focused mainly on obstruction of justice and Republicans highlighted a variety of issues on Mueller's investigation, including how it got started and if there was bias against Trump in the early days of the investigation.
Still, Democrats hope the hearings will weaken President Trump's re-election prospects, which is something that Mueller's book-length report did not seem to do."

But now, the Times has seriously revised its original report. Their original story left out a major fact – that the alleged victim doesn't confirm the accusation against Kavanaugh.
According to a new book by a pair of Times reporters, a Yale classmate by the name of Max Stier – who worked to defend President Clinton during legal battles in the 1990s – approached the FBI during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to say he witnessed Kavanaugh sexually assault a fellow classmate.

That accusation is similar to another made by Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that was brought up during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.
Throughout the course of that emotional 2018 process, Kavanaugh was accused of assault by three women, accusations he vehemently denied.
""I have never sexually assaulted anyone. Not in high school, not in college, not ever,"" Kavanaugh testified last year.
Ramirez was contacted by the FBI but according to the Times' original report, this alleged victim was not. That prompted some Democrats to demand impeachment.  
""It's more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter,"" tweeted presidential candidate Julian Castro.
Fellow candidates Senators Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris followed suit in their calls for impeachment.  
""I strongly opposed him based on his views on executive power which will continue to haunt our country as well as how he behaved including the allegation that we are hearing more about today,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) told ABC This Week.  
Former Vice President Joe Biden stopped short of an impeachment call stating, ""We need to get to the bottom of whether the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans pressured the FBI to ignore evidence or prevented them from following up on leads relating to Justice Kavanaugh's background investigation.""
But it turns out the New York Times report that prompted all that Democrat outrage wasn't entirely truthful. Now, in a revised version of that report, the Times says the alleged victim declined an interview and friends say she does not recall the incident at all.  
The National Review's John McCormack writes, ""Omitting this fact from the New York Times story is one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory.""
""I think this is the New York Times being bitter-enders,"" accused Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).

Wedged in between the two most liberal candidates, Senators Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MASS), front runner Joe Biden case himself as a practical progressive painting Medicare for all as out of touch.
""This is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Well, let's have a big idea. The tax of 2% the senator is talking about - that raises about $3 billion dollars. Guess what. that leaves you about $28 billion dollars short. The senator said before it's going to cost you. There will be a deductible in your paycheck,"" argued former Vice President Joe Biden.
""Let us be clear Joe. In the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as the Canadians or any other major country on earth,"" said Sanders waving his hands in his signature way.
""This is America,"" quipped Biden.
""Yeah but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries,"" responded Sanders.
And while Biden tossed a few arrows he took twice as many. The sharpest came from former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro.
""He wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions,"" said Castro.
""I stand with Barack Obama all eight years good, bad and indifferent,"" Biden responded.
Castro struck another blow still reverberating among Democrats when he played into speculation about Biden's mental acuity. It came as Castro worked to differentiate his health care plan from Biden's.
""My plan would do that. Your plan would not,"" Castro said.
""They do not have to buy-in. They do not have to buy-in,"" Biden responded. 
""You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in. You said they would have to buy in. Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?  Are you forgetting what you just said two minutes ago?"" Castro said to boos as Biden tried to figure out what Castro had said.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) made a name for herself by going after Biden in the first debate, but this time she kept her focus on the president.
""Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in the Wizard of Oz. You know, when you pull back the curtain it's a really small dude,"" she said with a smile as the audience laughed.
During a passionate moment on gun violence, Beto O'Rourke gave the NRA ample ammunition to fire up its base.
""Yes. We're gonna take your AR-15's, your AK-47's. We're not gonna allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore,"" said O'Rourke to applause.

The number of congressional Democrats calling for impeachment is growing.
The House Judiciary Committee started the day with a fiery hearing that ended with a party-line vote to approve a resolution that broadens the committee's investigative powers and could eventually lead to an impeachment inquiry.  But Republicans argue the move is misleading.
""At least acknowledge there's a reason why these are not formal impeachment inquiries,"" said Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA)
""Let's change the rules in the middle of the game because we've got to find something,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). ""We got to get this. We've got to find something."" 
""You want to give the allusion of impeachment without the reality of it,"" argued Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) ""You're duping that portion of your base that is clamoring for impeachment into thinking you are when you aren't.""
Thursday's resolution allows Chairman Jerry Nadler to decide if his committee hearings are part of any impeachment probe. It also allows witnesses to be questioned at those hearings and gives the committee access to documents in executive sessions, as well as giving the President due process. 
CBN News spoke with Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) who sits on the Judiciary Committee and argues Democrats are bending the rules with this resolution to try and impeach the president.
""This is wrong on so many levels,"" Biggs told CBN News. ""Let me give you a couple - number one, this is something they've wanted to do but again they're not doing it in the normal process. Normally you'd take this to the floor. You'd get your resolutions passed, they didn't. They had only one-third of their body even support it.""
""The impeachment tool was meant to really solve a real problem if you need to get someone out of office,"" he explained.  ""OK, that's fair but in this instance, two-thirds of Americans say we don't want impeachment, we want to move on, and let's get it going. So it's wrong on multiple levels.""
This week, Biggs was also named as the new chairman of the influential and conservative House Freedom Caucus. 
""I think what we want to go to now is that we want to make sure that we can work within our party to try and continue to make them more conservative and help them remember the promises we made,"" he told CBN News. 
Biggs will step into the chairman's seat on Oct. 2. "

Conservative Republican Dan Bishop won the race for an open congressional seat defeating Democratic candidate Dan McCready.
Bishop is a state senator and he tied himself tightly to President Trump who staged an election eve rally for him Monday night.
""Tonight the voters of North Carolina sent a message that shouldn't just be heard within the confines of the ninth district. It should reverberate across this country and in the halls of the Capitol. The voters said no to the radical liberal policies being pushed by today's Democratic Party,"" Bishop declared.
Some political analysts considered the race to be a referendum on President Trump as well as the upcoming 2020 congressional election.
While Bishop did win with Trump's support, it was a somewhat narrow victory in a historically strong Republican district, so pundits are saying it could be a sign the president faces a tough race in 2020.
The special election had to be held as a do-over after the 2018 congressional election result in that North Carolina district was rejected due to ballot fraud. Bishop was not involved in that 2018 race."

Watch Faith Nation weeknights on the CBN News Channel. Check local listings. 
President Trump announced Tuesday morning that he has asked his National Security Adviser John Bolton to resign.
He tweeted: ""I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.""
The president wasn't clear about what topics he specifically disagreed with Bolton about, but the move comes shortly after Trump canceled a peace summit with the Taliban at Camp David.
Trump said that he had ""disagreed strongly"" with many of Bolton's suggestions as a national security adviser, ""as did others in the administration.""
Some of those suggestions, according to Washington insiders, were over the handling of Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. 
One Republican familiar with the disagreements between Trump and Bolton told The Associated Press the adviser's opposition to a possible meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was a precipitating factor in the dismissal. French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying to broker such a meeting, possibly on the sidelines of the upcoming UN General Assembly, in the hope of salvaging the international Iran nuclear deal that Trump withdrew from.
Meanwhile, Trump just dropped plans for Taliban peace talks, citing the terrorist group's most recent bombing which killed a US service member, saying the Taliban can't kill Americans and expect a peace deal with the US. 
The White House had faced heavy criticism for even inviting the Taliban to Camp David, and Bolton reportedly was among those who disagreed with the idea of inviting the Islamic terrorist group to attend.
Bolton replied to the news of his removal with a tweet of his own, saying, ""I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow'.""
Bolton has reportedly texted multiple members of the media since Trump's tweet to insist that he resigned, disagreeing with the way the president is characterizing the encounter. 
Shortly before the news broke, Bolton had also tweeted about 9/11 saying: ""As we reflect this week on the horrific 9/11 attack, it's important to remember how far we've come in combatting radical Islamist terrorist groups but also how much work is left. We stand strong against regimes that sponsor terror & encourage violence against the US & our allies.""
Since joining the administration in the spring of last year, Bolton had been skeptical about the president's whirlwind reconciliation with North Korea and has advocated against Trump's decision last year to pull US troops out of Syria. He had tried to persuade Trump to keep US forces in Syria to counter the remnants of the Islamic State and Iranian influence in the region.
Bolton was also opposed to Trump's now-scrapped notion to bring Taliban negotiators to Camp David last weekend to try to finalize a peace deal in Afghanistan.
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, and a former Reagan administration official and defense contracting executive would fill Bolton's role on an acting basis. 
Bolton was named Trump's third national security adviser in March 2018 after the departure of Army Gen. H.R. McMaster.
Trump says he will pick a new security advisor next week."

It's a hard-fought contest viewed by some as a referendum on President Trump's job performance. 
But the president came out swinging during a visit to the state Monday night criticizing Democrats on everything from immigration to abortion.
Trump knows North Carolina is an important state to win if he is to be re-elected and so he traveled to Fayetteville in a last ditch effort to rally the troops.

It was his first Keep America Great rally in nearly a month. He urged North Carolina voters to reject what he called the failed ideas of the Democrats and elect Dan Bishop in the 9th district special election.
   
""Dan Bishop will fight with everything he has,"" the president said.
The Republican Bishop is in a tight race with Democratic challenger Dan McCready. One poll shows McCready leading Bishop by four points. The district has voted Republican since 1963, and the president appeared in North Carolina to help keep it that way.
""Tomorrow we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020,"" Trump insisted.
The president delivered a pro-America speech, detailing his accomplishments since taking over the White House in January 2017.
On immigration, he attacked Democratic policies, saying sanctuary cities and the harboring of illegal immigrant criminals is ""disloyalty to American citizens.""
""By the way, we're building that wall and it's going up very big,"" he said.
The crowd cheered and chanted, ""Build the wall, build the wall!""
The president took some time to emphasize his position on abortion saying that ""virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth. ""
And Trump mentioned Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's comments about allowing a woman and her doctor to decide if a baby should live moments after birth. Trump called it an execution.
""This is a radical Democrat idea and that's why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortions because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God,"" Trump said.
The president also talked about healthcare and promised to enact a plan that would protect patient choices. ""We're going to end up with a better plan, you watch, we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. You have my word.""
And he gave one last reminder to voters of what is at stake, not only in North Carolina's ninth congressional district, but also nationwide.
""The radical Democrats want to dismantle, demolish and destroy everything that you've gained and they will do it and it won't take that long,"" he warned.

Speaking to The Breakfast Club, the colloquially-named “Mayor Pete” admitted that abortion was a “tough issue for a lot of people to think through morally,” before insisting that there are “a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath.”
“Even that is something that we can interpret differently,” he added. “No matter what you think about the cosmic question of how life begins, most Americans can get on board with the idea of, ‘I might draw the line here. You might draw the line there.’ The most important thing is the person who should be drawing the line is the woman making the decision.”
Conservative blogger Matt Walsh countered Buttigieg’s argument with this:
A very good question to ponder, indeed.
In addition to the logical argument, science is increasingly demonstrating the contradiction to Buttigieg’s assertions. The heartbeat, a working mind, nerves, feelings and senses are just some of the things scientists are pointing to earlier and earlier with each technological advancement.
“Fertilization is a critical landmark,” wrote Dr. Fabiola Müller. and Professor O’Rahilly in the Textbook, “Human Embryology & Teratology.” “Because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.”
As for the Biblical grounding, there are a whole host of scriptures that plainly demonstrate the value God places on the unborn as little lives to be protected at all costs.
Here, Faithwire reels off some 79 Bible verses in which God specifically mentions or references the life of the unborn. A few examples are as follows:
Psalm 127:3 — “Behold, children are a gift of the Lord,
The fruit of the womb is a reward.”
Ecclesiastes 11:5 — “Just as you do not know the path of the wind and how bones are formed in the womb of the pregnant woman, so you do not know the activity of God who makes all things.”
Luke 1:44 — “For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.”

Congress also faces only three weeks to strike a deal on government funding before a possible government shutdown. The House and Senate are taking different paths to try and avoid a shutdown.
While the Senate plans to work on passing appropriations bills, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer wrote to his colleagues that he's ""disappointed that the Senate failed to introduce a single appropriations bill for the first time in more than three decades"" concluding that ""a continuing resolution will be necessary to prevent another government shutdown.""
BELOW: Economic Expert Stephen Moore Talks About the $22.5 Trillion US Debt and His 'Penny Plan' to Fix Our Fiscal Mess
Two issues that could complicate the budget deals: border wall funding and gun control.
""I think what the president is doing is the right thing to do, but I think if you take away that congressional ability to decide how money is spent, you really take away the biggest tool that Congress has in the unique balance of power our Constitution creates,"" Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) told NBC's Meet the Press.
After 53 people died from mass shootings in the US in August alone, Democrats are returning to Washington with a priority on gun control.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said, ""Enough is enough. Congress is returning to session, and our first order of business in the Senate should be to pass the House-passed bipartisan background checks act.""
Democrats on the 2020 campaign trail are echoing that call, with candidates uniting for a video calling for gun control legislation.
""Gun violence is literally life and death, it has become so numbingly common that we have kids going to school wondering if they're going to be physically safe,"" say candidates Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg in a combined campaign ad.
And with the growing deficit and debt still not under control, Trump now has another 2020 challenger from his own party – former South Carolina Governor and Congressman Mark Sanford.
""We're headed toward the most predictable financial crisis in the history of our country and we've never been as financially vulnerable, save for the start of our republic, the Civil War and World War Two.

Tuesday's do-over is the last congressional race of 2018. North Carolina's 9th District has been held by the GOP since 1963. In 2016, Trump won the district by 11 percentage points.
Now, after illegal ballot tampering canceled last November's election results, Democrats supporting Dan McCready think they have a chance to storm the stronghold in a run against Republican Dan Bishop.
At a rally in Fayetteville, NC, Trump warned, ""The radical Democrats want to dismantle and demolish and destroy everything that you've gained and they will do it and it won't take long.""
Some political analysts think the President's make or break endorsement in the state could be a test of his own chances in 2020. 
""This will tell us if Trump can carry candidates through suburban districts or not,"" said Sarah Chamberlain, president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which represents moderate Republicans. If not, she said, the GOP must ""work harder to address the concerns of suburban individuals, mainly women.""
Before leaving Washington, Trump dismissed questions of whether a poor result for the Republican candidate would serve as a warning sign in next year's elections.
""No, I don't see it as a bellwether,"" Trump said.
Marshville residents Philip and Diane Ezzell, both 70, were near the front of the line waiting to enter the Trump rally. Both attributed their support for Bishop to his backing by Trump. ""We like his values, and he supports Trump,"" Diane Ezzell said. ""And we don't want no socialist clowns.""
That was a reference to a TV spot by Bishop superimposing the faces of McCready and other prominent Democrats on swaying clown figures.

""A Republic, If You Can Keep It,"" was written because Gorsuch ""wanted to say something about the Constitution, the separation of powers and the judge's role in it,"" he told The Washington Post.
The title is taken from a comment, reportedly made by Benjamin Franklin in response to a question about what kind of government the delegates created at the Constitutional Convention.

Neil Gorsuch Confirmed: Will He Be Scalia or Souter?
Gorsuch, 52, was nominated by President Trump and confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2017.
He revealed more of his judicial ideology in a recent interview with the Associated Press.
""It's one thing to think that judges occasionally, mistakenly, wrongly decide cases based on who they like and who they dislike as parties. It's another thing to think that judges are just politicians who are supposed to do that,"" Gorsuch explained.
He mentioned that judges are not politicians, even if their decision in a case is predicable - on account of the president who appointed them.
He would not answer questions about President Trump. ""If you're asking me about politics, I'm not going to touch that,"" Gorsuch said.
All he would say regarding the president was that during the 2017 nomination process, Trump ""was very gracious to my family.""
Gorsuch addressed the 'living Constitution' and clarified that having a dynamic meaning or a sense that the Constitution changes with time is illogical.
""You know, the living Constitution is going to take your rights away and it's going to add ones that aren't there - we have a written Constitution. It's about honoring the words the people chose to adopt. What are the first three words of the Constitution? It's 'We the people,' not 'We the states,' not 'We the nine old judges,'"" he added.
He pointed out that a justice must consider whether or not a decision aligns with the authenticity of the Constitution and if other justices have questioned it.
""Originalism has regained its place at the table of constitutional interpretation, and textualism in the reading of statutes has triumphed. And neither one is going anywhere on my watch,"" Gorsuch proclaimed.
In his book, Gorsuch petitions for goodwill and kindness, recalling advice from his family, who taught him that he would never resent being kind to others. It consists of essays, speeches, past opinions, thoughts on civics and civility. It will be published Tuesday."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), one of the leading candidates for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination, sparked outrage for linking abortion to population control during a CNN town hall event in Vermont Wednesday night.
During a discussion on climate change, Sanders said he would support taxpayer-funded programs to provide abortions and birth control for women in developing countries as a measure to combat the climate crisis.
""Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth. I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it's crucial to face,"" a member of the audience asked the Vermont senator. ""Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?""

""The answer is yes,"" Sanders replied. ""And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions.""
""And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control to me is totally absurd,"" he continued. "" So I think especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, is something I very, very strongly support.""
Pro-life supporters have called Sander's response ""horrifying."" 
Constitutional law attorney Jenna Ellis told CBN's Newswatch program she agrees with other conservatives and finds Sanders comments ""absolutely horrifying.""
""This is something where the Democrats are prioritizing a political interest literally over the lives of millions of children,"" she said. ""And to think that Bernie Sanders and the Democrats could be so callous toward human life and especially in other countries that to say that simply because of climate change that we need to promote abortion and encourage young mothers to literally murder their children.  
""If this doesn't show the American people how far progressive-left the Democratic Party has gone, I don't know what will,"" Ellis added. 
""Our government has no plausible constitutional legal or moral argument to be promoting or paying for abortions in other countries,"" she noted. 
CNN host S.E. Cupp said Sanders was talking about eugenics when he made those comments. Eugenics is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as ""the practice or advocacy of controlled selective breeding of human populations (as by sterilization) to improve the population's genetic composition.""
""Let's just state for the record: talking about needing 'population control' through ABORTION for the sake of CLIMATE is talking about EUGENICS,"" Cupp tweeted. ""The fact that @BernieSanders is willing to entertain this vile idea is not only disgusting, it should be disqualifying.""
The anchor followed up in a second tweeted, ""Also, if we're going to talk about population control, we should bring up Malthusian theory, a cautionary tale against not anticipating how science and industry would solve future problems, like population growth. Let's talk, @BernieSanders.""
Other social media users also responded to Sander's comments with disdain.  
""Guys, Bernie has done it. He's declared children in the Third World problematic,"" tweeted Michael Brendan Dougherty.
Twitter follower Bennie Johnson also tweeted: 
""Democrat Voter: There are too many humans on earth.
Bernie: I agree. We need to fund abortions to poor, third world countries.

The hearings broke civil norms with senators frequently interrupting and stepping on each other verbally and a litany of outbursts from protesters. At one point, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) described the process as the ""Twilight Zone,"" referring to the popular TV series that featured a blend of fantasy, science fiction, and horror.
Carrie Severino, an attorney for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, worked with other like-minded groups to support Kavanaugh's nomination.
Her familiarity with what happened behind-the-scenes and some of the key players is the subject of her new book, Justice on Trial, co-authored by Molly Hemingway.
It includes firsthand accounts from sources in the White House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court, describing how the confirmation fight was less about Kavanaugh than the potential ideological shift in the balance of the court.
That, according to Severino, brought out a well-coordinated effort between special interest groups, public relations firms, and the media.
 
""So all of those went together went to produce, really, the worst confirmation process we've seen in American history,"" Severino told CBN News.
At the White House nomination announcement, President Donald Trump had called for a swift, bipartisan vote. However, the hearings moved slowly with a series of delays that eventually led to sordid allegations of alcohol abuse, assault, and gang rape against Trump's second high court nominee.
As heartrending as it was watching Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh's accuser, testify and Kavanaugh offer his rebuttal, Severino insists it was just as volatile behind the scenes.
The book includes one account among senators and their staff right outside the hearing room when tempers flared.
""That room was full of dozens of people: senators, their staffers. And a fist fight nearly broke out,"" Severino explained. ""There was the frustration. They felt like senators weren't playing it straight and that there was interference by the staff that was inappropriate.""
As Justice Kavanaugh returns for his second term in October, the fallout from last year's contentious hearings still linger.
Republicans who voted for his confirmation are locked in tough re-election bids in Maine and Colorado. And some 2020 White House hopefuls have suggested packing the court to counter the conservative ideological shift.
Severino warns filling the next Supreme Court vacancy could actually be worse.
""What concerns me is, of course, the next seat could be a liberal justice stepping down with Donald Trump making the replacement,"" Severino told CBN News. ""If you think Kennedy to Kavanaugh is a shift, a liberal justice – Justice Ginsberg, for example – to a Trump nominee would be a night and day change on the court. And I think we could see the incentives built to have an even more outrageous nomination process.""

Liz Cheney (R-WY) is standing firm after facing fresh criticism for her desire to keep God in Congress. The dispute centers around critics who want to drop the words ""so help you God"" from a congressional committee's oath taken by witnesses who testify before Congress.
Back in January, the House Natural Resources Committee voted to keep the oath intact after facing backlash when Fox News reported that Democrats were trying to remove ""so help me God"" from the oath. 
At the time, Cheney, who holds the third-highest position in GOP House leadership, spoke against the move, saying, ""It is incredible, but not surprising, that the Democrats would try to remove God from committee proceedings in one of their first acts in the majority.""

""They really have become the party of Karl Marx,"" she had said.
Now the story is back in the headlines. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) appeared on a television program Sunday titled ""Freethought Matters,"" produced by the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF). The show airs in 12 cities across the US. 
Host Annie Laurie Gaylor, the co-founder of the FFRF, brought up the subject of the congressional oath to Huffman who is the founder of the Congressional Freethought Caucus. In 2017, Huffman publicly declared he is a humanist. 
""Well I thought it was a really good sign that the Democrats in Congress and the House have dropped the religious oath for witnesses who are swearing-in, and they did that kind of quietly at the beginning of the year and then I know there's been some pushback, but that shows respect for the Constitution and an increasing awareness that many of us just don't believe in a God,"" Gaylor said.
""Well, unfortunately, it's been kind of a sporadic standard,"" Huffman replied. ""Some committees have dropped the oath, others have not. I sit on the Natural Resources Committee and in our original proposed rules for the committee, we proposed that we drop the oath or we allow witnesses to simply say it voluntarily if they chose to, which to me makes perfect sense. And wouldn't you know it, Liz Cheney just went ballistic. She smelled blood in the water, went on Fox News and started ranting about how Democrats were dropping God from the Congress.""
""And at our next meeting, the Republicans, one-by-one, made these pronouncements about how, you know, we shouldn't be against God and Democrats were against God, and unfortunately my Democratic colleagues backed down, and so we now nominally still have that same oath,"" he said.
A Cheney spokesperson offered a response to Huffman's statement to CBN News, saying, ""Liz Cheney will always defend God. Period. If that bothers Rep. Huffman, we'll be praying for him."" 
After failing to court the evangelical vote in recent elections, last month Democrats embraced nonreligious voters in a new resolution.
As CBN News reported, the resolution was unanimously passed on Aug. 24 at the DNC's summer meeting in San Francisco, CA. 
The DNC noted that this unaffiliated group is the ""largest religious group within the Democratic Party, growing from 19% in 2007 to one in three today."" The resolution also asserts ""the Democratic Party is an inclusive organization that recognizes that morals, values, and patriotism are not unique to any particular religion, and are not necessarily reliant on having a religious worldview.""
""Religiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values,"" the resolution states and also adds they should advocate for ""rational public policy based on sound science and universal humanistic values.""
This is the first time a major political party has attempted to embrace America's non-believers. "

Meanwhile, a recent New York Times article highlighted a conservative group that's releasing embarrassing statements and social media posts by journalists, including a New York Times editor who posted anti-Semitic tweets in college.
While the Times says the editor's remarks are a violation of standards, it also accuses the group of trying to intimidate the press by seeking to ""harass and embarrass anyone affiliated with leading news organizations that are asking tough questions.""
One writer at Politico disagrees. Jack Shafer writes, ""Journalists don't deserve a get-out-of-bigotry-jail free card just because they're journalists.""
Dan Gainor of the Media Research Center told CBN News that some journalists seem to believe the First Amendment is only for them.
""The Constitution, last time I checked, belongs to all of us,"" Gainor said. ""That means freedom of the press belongs to each one of us, freedom of speech belongs to each one of us, so if you say or do really embarrassing things don't be surprised if someone goes and looks at your Twitter feed and says, 'Hey, I saw where you did this thing'.""

Kirsten Gillibrand Ends Bid to be Democrat's Presidential Nominee,"Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the presidential race Wednesday, abruptly ending a campaign that collapsed after low polling and major fundraising struggles.
""I know this isn't the result that we wanted,"" the 52-year-old New York senator said in an online video in which she didn't endorse any other 2020 Democratic White House hopeful. ""But it's important to know when it's not your time.""
Her decision came when she failed to qualify for a debate coming next month in Houston by not hitting 2% in at least four approved public opinion polls while securing 130,000 unique donors. She spent millions on online and TV ads to garner campaign contributions from people contributing as little as $1. 
On the eve of Wednesday's qualifying deadline, Gillibrand met with her family and decided that if a pair of polls set to be released the following morning didn't help her meet the polling threshold, she'd drop out. 
Both polls showed her at zero percent. 
Even before Gillibrand's announcement, the crowded Democrat presidential field of more than two dozen candidates had already begun to narrow. U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California left the 2020 race in July, followed by former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts earlier this month."

It could add to the struggle for Republicans trying to keep control of the Senate in the 2020 election.
""After much prayer and consultation with my family and my doctors, I have made the very tough decision to leave the U.S. Senate at the end of this year,"" he announced Wednesday.
The 74-year-old senator has been dealing with Parkinson's disease since 2013, and he was injured after falling this summer.
""I am leaving a job I love because my health challenges are taking their toll on me, my family and my staff,"" Isakson said. ""My Parkinson's has been progressing, and I am continuing physical therapy to recover from a fall in July. In addition, this week I had surgery to remove a growth on my kidney.""
""With the mounting health challenges I am facing, I have concluded that I will not be able to do the job over the long term in the manner the citizens of Georgia deserve. It goes against every fiber of my being to leave in the middle of my Senate term, but I know it's the right thing to do on behalf of my state,"" Isakson said.
Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp will appoint a temporary replacement when Isakson steps down December 31.  
Right now, Georgia has two Republican senators. But in November 2020, both of Georgia's Senate seats will now be on the ballot, setting up a rare battle in a state where Republicans are facing stiff challenges.
Isakson's Senate term would have ended in 2022. So whoever wins the special election to replace him in 2020 will only hold the seat for two years before facing reelection.

Sean Duffy of Wisconsin Resigning from Congress,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Republican Rep. Sean Duffy, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump who represents northern Wisconsin in Congress, announced Monday that he is resigning next month to spend more time with his family.
Duffy, 47, posted on Facebook that he recently learned that his ninth child, who is due in October, has a heart condition and ""will need even more love, time, and attention due to complications.""
Duffy, who was on the cast of MTV's ""The Real World: Boston"" in 1997, plans to resign on Sept. 23. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers will have to call a special election to fill the vacancy.
Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District is the state's largest, geographically, covering all or parts of 20 northern and northwestern counties.
Duffy's district has grown more conservative since he took office in 2011. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney carried it with 51% of the vote, compared with 48% that went to then-President Barack Obama. In 2016, Trump won it by 57% to 37% over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Duffy has been widely mentioned as a possible candidate for U.S. Senate or governor in 2022.
In his resignation announcement, he said being away from his family for four days a week to serve in Congress is ""challenging"" and ""I have always been open to signs from God when it comes to balancing my desire to serve both my family and my country.""
""I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby, and family need right now,"" Duffy said. ""It is not an easy decision - because I truly love being your Congressman - but it is the right decision for my family, which is my first love and responsibility.""
Duffy replaced 15-term Democratic Rep. Dave Obey, who announced his retirement 10 months after Duffy entered his first race for the seat. Duffy had been a district attorney for eight years before being elected to Congress.
Duffy met his future wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, on the set of MTV's ""Road Rules: All Stars"" in 1998. Together, they have eight children and Duffy announced in May that she was pregnant with their ninth child.
State Sen. Tom Tiffany, a Republican who lives in Duffy's district, was one of the first to release a statement after the retirement was announced, thanking Duffy for his service and wishing him luck. Tiffany did not immediately return a message seeking comment on whether he plans to run for the seat."

Trump, growing more isolated in Washington, faces a tepid reception on the world stage, where a list of challenges awaits. Anxiety is growing over a global slowdown , and there are new points of tension with allies on trade, Iran and Russia.

Trump Admin Talks 'Tax Cuts 2.0', Pushes Flagging Euro Economies to Go 'Pro-Growth' at G7  
Fears of a financial downturn are spreading, meaning the need for cooperation and a collective response is essential. Yet Trump has ridiculed Germany for its economic travails at a time when he may have to turn to Chancellor Angela Merkel and others to help blunt the force of China’s newly aggressive tariffs on U.S. goods. Those trade penalties, combined with the economic slowdown, have raised political alarms for Trump’s reelection effort .
Before he left Washington, Trump declared that U.S. businesses with dealings in China are “hereby ordered” to begin moving home. There was no immediate explanation of just what he expected or what authority he had to make it happen. He also imposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports.
“Tariffs are working out very well for us,” Trump said. “People don’t understand that yet.”
Earlier, he had made light of a sharp drop in the financial markets in reaction to his latest trade actions. His tongue-in-cheek tweet speculated that the Dow’s plunge could be tied to the departure of a lower-tier candidate in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
In recent days, Trump has sent mixed signals on a number of policy fronts. At one point, he moved to simmer the trade conflict with China in order to ease the impact on American consumers during the holiday shopping season. At another, he flip-flopped on the need for tax cuts to stimulate an economy that Trump publicly insists is rocketing.
Feeding Trump’s anxiety, aides say, is his realization that the economy — the one sturdy pillar undergirding his bid for a second term — is undeniably wobbly.
Now the president who has long eschewed multilateralism hopes to use his time in Biarritz to rally global leaders around the need to do more to promote economic growth. He engineered a late change to the summit agenda, requesting a working session on global economic issues.
For the world leaders, it was the latest example of unpredictability from Trump. After two-and-a-half years of Trump’s presidency, traditional American allies have come to expect the unexpected. Increasingly they are looking elsewhere for leadership.
“They have figured out how to deal with this president,” said Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think what we’re going to see out of this summit is, on the one hand, an effort by countries and the leaders to align with the president, but also an understanding that we’ll have to do more without the U.S. president.”
Trump arrived on Air Force One after changing airplanes in Bordeaux, on account of the shorter runway in Biarritz. His motorcade passed through barricaded streets on his way to the heavily secured summit site, as some residents looked on from windows overhead.
The annual G-7 summit has historically been used to highlight common ground among the world’s leading democracies. But in a bid to work around Trump’s impulsiveness, French President Emmanuel Macron has eschewed plans for a formal joint statement from this gathering.
Last year’s summit, hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, ended in acrimony when Trump felt he had been slighted by Trudeau after the president left the meeting.
Trump tweeted insults at Trudeau from aboard Air Force One as he flew to a summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Trump withdrew his signature from the statement of principles that all seven nations had agreed to.
At his first G-7 summit in 2017, Trump’s strong feelings against climate change roiled the gathering in Italy.
Trump has made his “America first” priorities clear at every turn.
At a recent campaign rally in New Hampshire, the crowd roared with approval when Trump said: “I’m the President of the United States of America. I’m not the president of the world.”
Addressing the global slowdown isn’t the only pressing challenge that Trump has discovered requires joint action.
For more than a year, his administration has struggled with persuading European leaders to repatriate captured fighters from the Islamic State group. So far his entreaties have been met with deaf ears.
Alterman and Heather Conley, the Europe expert at CSIS, both said Macron appeared to be trying to fill the void left by Trump on the world stage, noting the French leader’s recent efforts to try to reduce tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
Many of the summit proceedings will take place behind closed doors, in intimate settings designed for the leaders to develop personal relationships with one another.
Trump, White House aides said, was looking forward to meeting with new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , the brash pro-Brexit leader whose election he’d backed. Trump has scheduled individual meetings with several of his counterparts, including Macron, Trudeau, Merkel, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Other topics on the agenda will be the clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong; Iran’s renewed nuclear enrichment and interference with shipping in the Strait of Hormuz; and the Islamic State prisoners currently imprisoned by American-backed Kurdish forces in Syria.
Increasingly fearful of an economic slowdown’s potential to diminish his 2020 electoral chances, Trump intended to press leaders about what can be done to spur growth in the U.S. and abroad, as well as to open European, Japanese and Canadian markets to American manufacturers and producers. Trump has imposed or threatened to impose tariffs on all three markets in his pursuit of free, fair and reciprocal trade.
It is unclear what substantive steps could be taken by the leaders to address the global slowdown, and much of that discussion stands to be dominated by disagreements on Trump’s trade policies.
While on French soil, Trump also intends to raise with Macron and the other leaders the issue of a digital services tax that France has imposed on major technology companies such as Google and Facebook despite Trump’s threats of retaliatory tariffs on French wine.
The Trump administration says the tax targets and discriminates against U.S. businesses.
The European Council’s president, Donald Tusk, has promised European Union action if the U.S. follows through.
