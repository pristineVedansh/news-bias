The ""incentive"" has been called impractical by tax critics.
""Canadians should not be punished every time they drive their kids to school or turn up the thermostat on a cold winter day,"" Conservative MP Dean Allison said. ""In my riding of Niagara West public transportation is almost non-existent.""
Winter heating was one of the reasons officials gave for increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
""A price on carbon pollution gives households and businesses a powerful incentive to save money by making choices like turning down the thermostat and taking transit,"" noted the memo—Carbon Pricing Impacts. ""Pricing pollution works. It is the most effective, least expensive way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve our climate goals.""
It was confirmed by the Department of Environment that in 2018—the first full year that Canada had a carbon tax—greenhouse gas emissions increased. The department blamed the findings on ""colder winter weather"" in a National Inventory Report 1990-2018.
Emissions still increased though the remaining coal-burning power plants in Ontario and Manitoba were shuttered and billions were spent by the Department of Environment.
""Between 2014 and 2019 the Government of Canada invested $60 billion to drive down greenhouse gas emissions, generate clean technologies, help Canadians and communities adapt to a changing climate, and protect the environment,"" the National Inventory Report said.
Under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act the price of diesel is set to raise by 14¢, aviation fuel 13¢, gasoline 12¢, natural gas 10¢ (cubic metre), and fuel tax 8¢.
Research found that vehicle emission went up ""largely due to more driving""—confirming earlier studies that claimed a large number of Canadians could not shorten commutes despite the fuel tax.
""Few recognized how charging businesses or consumers a tax would result in effective change,"" noted a report called Public Opinion Research On Energy Issues from 2015.
""A few did recognize the cost implications of global warming and did think that taxing greenhouse gas emissions could be a way to spur behavioural change and the development of cleaner technology, but these participants were outnumbered by those who expressed cynicism about how the money from a greenhouse gas emissions tax would be spent by the government collecting it,"" wrote researchers from the Department of Natural Resources."

In Ontario, federal voting intentions calculated by 338Canada from July 27 to 29 show that the Liberals are just one percentage point ahead of the Conservatives.
The data shows the Liberals at 36 percent (down five percentage points), the Conservatives are at 35 percent (up one percentage point), and the NDP is trailing behind at 19 percent followed by the Green Party is at six percent.
""Of course regional numbers mean smaller sample and higher uncertainty, so use with caution. But still these are really bad numbers in Ontario for the federal Liberals,"" said  P.J. Fournier of 338Canada.
""Such numbers would swing at least 20-25 seats in the province alone.""

Trump posted a tweet on Thursday morning claiming that if the country uses universal mail-in voting due to coronavirus restrictions, ""2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history.""
With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA.

""It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???""
Trump has been denouncing the use of mail-in voting for months as the idea has been brought forward by health officials and government officials to avoid further spread of the virus.
If the election date is delayed as Trump is suggesting, it would require changing federal law which would have to be put through the Republican-controlled Senate but also the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives."
0,2020-07-22 11:47:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/tpc-syndication-how-much-mortgage-can-i-afford,How much mortgage can I actually afford?,"Buying your own home is thrilling — the freedom, the space, the white picket fence — but it’s also the biggest financial undertaking of your life.
Record-low mortgage rates are inspiring buyers to flock to the housing market during the pandemic, but an uncertain economy and strict new mortgage rules mean Canadians still need to manage their money wisely.
And let’s not forget about the car insurance, utility bills, student loans and other expenses that are too easy to push to the back of your mind.
Here’s how to determine whether you’ve really got the cash for your dream digs.
How much money do you have?
GaudiLab / Shutterstock
The first factor in the calculation is your down payment. In Canada, homebuyers must be able to provide at least 5% of a home’s purchase price upfront if the place costs $500,000 or less. If the place costs more than $500,000, tack on another 10% of the excess. If the place costs more than $1 million, you need to put down 20%.
Regardless of the price of the home, if you don’t have enough savings to put 20% down, you’re labelled a risky “high-ratio” buyer. That means your lender is forced to buy mortgage default insurance that will protect them in case you go broke and stop paying. The cost of that insurance will be passed on to you in the form of larger mortgage payments.
If you were thinking of using a loan or credit card to make a down payment, you’re out of luck. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) rules that came into effect July 1, 2020 say “non-traditional sources of down payment that increase indebtedness” are no longer OK.
First-time buyers can lean on the federal Home Buyers’ Plan, which allows you to borrow up to $35,000 (or $70,000 for couples) from a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) to purchase your first home.
Once you’ve got your down payment ready, don’t forget to budget for closing costs. A lot goes into finalizing a deal on the house market, including lawyer fees, land transfer taxes and title insurance. The total could land anywhere between 1.5% to 4% of your home’s price. On a $500,000 home, that means you might need an extra $20,000 in the bank.
And after all that, you still need money to eat and enough cash in your emergency fund to weather an unexpected expense or job loss. Even if you’re making good money, you may need to save up for quite a while.
How much money do you earn?

The second factor is your monthly mortgage payments.
You’ll face firm restrictions here if you need your mortgage insured by the CMHC, but you probably want to stick within these limits regardless. If you’re “house poor” and up to your ears in debt, you can forget about saving for retirement, paying for your car or going on a vacation.
The two numbers to know are your Gross Debt Service (GDS) ratio and Total Debt Service (TDS) ratio.
Your GDS is the percentage of your gross income that you spend on housing, including mortgage payments but also utilities, condo fees and property taxes. The CMHC caps your GDS at 35%, meaning your housing expenses shouldn’t drain much more than a third of your income.
Your TDS includes your housing expenses but also all of your other debt, like credit card payments and car payments. The CMHC will refuse to insure your mortgage if your TDS exceeds 42% of your annual income.
Even if you’re not bound by CMHC rules, keep these limits in mind when deciding for yourself whether a home is affordable.
How do lenders decide what to give me?
Rawpixel.com / Shutterstock
Mortgage lenders look at your financial status and history when deciding how much money to lend you and at what interest rate. Can you be trusted to pay off your debts? That’s the million-dollar question.
Expect lenders to look at your credit score and maybe your credit report, too. The CMHC asks for a minimum credit score of 680 from those in need of default insurance, but lenders want to be impressed. The higher your score, the more reliable you appear, so check your score for free online and take steps to improve it.
They’ll also look at your annual income and debts (that is, your GDS and TDS) to see whether you’re taking on more than you can financially handle. Lenders also prize stability; in their eyes, an ideal borrower isn't a self-employed freelancer but an employee who has worked for the same company for more than two years.
A good rule of thumb is that you can expect a lender who likes you to offer a mortgage up to four times your gross annual income. So if you make $50,000 a year, you might get a loan of up to $200,000. You’ll also get a better mortgage rate than your competition.
Just remember, there’s a difference between “How big of a mortgage can I get?” and “How big of a mortgage can I afford?” Just because a lender will give you a big sack of money doesn’t mean you can afford to take the whole thing.
How to make a mortgage more affordable

No matter how good you look as a borrower, your mortgage will be a serious drain on your finances. You’ll want to explore every avenue to keep costs down:
Provide a larger down payment, if you have the cash. When you pay more now, you have a smaller mortgage to pay off and thus lower monthly payments. And if you put down 20%, you won’t have to worry about mortgage default insurance or CMHC restrictions.
Consider the First-Time Home Buyer Incentive. This program gives the federal government a cut of your home in exchange for cash to put toward the down payment. Not everyone considers it a good deal, however.
Extend your amortization period. By giving yourself more time to pay off your mortgage, you won’t have to pay nearly as much each month. You will end up paying a lot more in interest in the long run, but your payments will be more manageable while you deal with other expenses.
Go a-hunting for a better deal. Don’t just go to your local bank and accept whatever interest rate they offer you. Shop around and get quotes from many different lenders, because even a fraction of a percentage point can save you buckets of money month after month.
Take some time to compare mortgage rates from more than 30 federally insured lenders and see what’s available."

The Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) announced plans in early June to reduce borrowing limits, demand higher credit scores and restrict down payments for anyone who needs default insurance from the agency. That kind of insurance is mandatory for “high-ratio” buyers putting less than 20% down on a home.
While the change is scary, buyers still have ways to shape up in the eyes of the CMHC — or dodge the agency entirely.
Why did this happen?
DOERS / Shutterstock
Evan Siddall, president and CEO of the CMHC, explains the changes are meant to steady the economy in the age of the coronavirus by controlling debt and protecting lenders from people who pose a high risk of defaulting.
While the rules will sting for some people trying to crack their way into the real estate market, they could be a boon for others. By reducing the number of buyers, the crown corporation hopes to quell demand and balance out home prices.
“COVID-19 has exposed long-standing vulnerabilities in our financial markets, and we must act now to protect the economic futures of Canadians,” Siddall explained in a statement.
“These actions will protect homebuyers, reduce government and taxpayer risk and support the stability of housing markets while curtailing excessive demand and unsustainable house price growth.”
What are the new rules?

First, homebuyers seeking a high-ratio mortgage are no longer able to submit a down payment with money borrowed from credit cards, unsecured personal loans or lines of credit. Only “traditional sources” of cash, such as savings, equity from the sale of a house or financial support from relatives, will fly.
Second, the minimum credit score to qualify has jumped from 600 to 680. If you don’t know your credit score, you can check it for free online. If it’s too low, you’ll have to take steps to improve it.
Third, borrowers are now capped at spending 35% of their gross income on housing. That includes the mortgage itself, property taxes and utilities. They're also only able to borrow up to 42% of their gross income, taking into account all of their other loans and credit.
Before, buyers could spend up to 39% of their gross income and borrow up to 44%. That means potential buyers saw their purchasing power cut by up to 12%.
For example, someone with a $100,000 income buying a single-family home could have qualified for a $490,000 mortgage with 5% down before July 1. Now, their limit has dropped to $435,000.
What should homebuyers do?

It’s important to recognize that, if you’re not a risky borrower in the eyes of the CMHC, these changes may not affect you at all.
“They are impacting a subset of borrowers who need mortgage insurance,” says Toronto-based broker Sean Cooper, author of the book Burn Your Mortgage. Even those homebuyers, he says, “still have options.”
You see, the government doesn't care whether it insures your mortgage. It just needs to know your mortgage is insured.
Homebuyers excluded by these changes should look around for a lender that also works with Genworth or Canada Guaranty, the country’s two private-sector providers of mortgage default insurance. Those companies have decided not to tighten their restrictions.
“They are usually lockstep with the CMHC, so this is definitely out of the ordinary,” says Cooper.
So even if the CMHC thinks you’re a bad bet, you'll still find a range of lenders that want your business.
Is anyone else affected?

The other good news is that the new lending rules don’t impact homeowners who want to take advantage of today’s historically low rates.
“As of right now, the rules haven’t changed for refinancing,” says Cooper. “The fact that Genworth and Canada Guaranty didn’t match the CMHC’s changes makes me think that there’s less likelihood of more changes in the future.”
Today’s rock-bottom rates are predicted to last for at least 12 to 18 months, until the economy starts to stabilize from COVID-19 crisis.
That means there’s no better time to see how much you can save on interest and your monthly mortgage payments. The opportunity to hold on to more cash is especially welcome while the country’s financial outlook remains uncertain.
Whether you’re buying or refinancing, it pays to shop around and get the best deal. Compare rates from more than 30 lenders — including many that don’t need to use the CMHC."

For a long time, it was hard to get companies to share your score without paying.
If you've haven't checked your score in a while because you didn't want to pay upward of $20 for this simple service, we have good news.
Nowadays it's easier than ever to obtain a free credit score and you can get one in a few different ways.
1. Use a free online service

You can receive free credit scores from online providers like Borrowell within minutes — and get access to free credit monitoring, too.
These online services provide immediate access to a credit score from at least one of the two major credit bureaus — TransUnion and Equifax — giving you an accurate picture of your credit status. Just be wary of any provider that asks for your credit card information.
Remember, looking into your credit score does not count as a hard inquiry into your credit and is not one of the factors that will affect your score.
2. Check your bank's website or app

If you bank with Scotiabank, RBC or CIBC, you're in luck.
CIBC allows its customers to check their credit score free of charge using its mobile app, but it's important to know you'll only get a fresh look at your score every three months.
Meanwhile, you can get a credit score and report for free through the Scotiabank or RBC banking portals online or on their respective apps. Both update your credit information once per month, giving you a more accurate picture.
If you're thinking about switching banks, Scotia is worth taking a look at right now. It's offering a $300 welcome gift for a couple of different account types.
3. Get one when taking out a loan

If you're one of the many Canadians rushing to apply for a mortgage (as rates fall towards all-time lows), you'll receive your credit score as part of the application process.
Applying for personal loans will also net you access to a credit score. If you apply for a loan and your application is denied, the lender is required by law to show you your credit score.
They'll also let you know which of the major credit bureaus provided your credit report. If you're not satisfied with the result, you can get a copy of your credit report at no extra charge.
You can also get a credit report for free from either credit bureau, you just have to request the report by mail.
Unlike Equifax, TransUnion also allows you to request a free online credit report once per month. Remember, your credit report won't include your credit score, even though it's used to calculate the number.
Why you need to know your credit score
It's important to have access to your credit score and your credit history so you can ensure you get the best deal from lenders.
Monitoring your credit situation lets you know when you're off track — or if a company has made a mistake on your report. Then you can start fixing your credit score fast.
Since lenders rely on credit scores to decide whether to do business with you, keeping tabs on your score will give you a good idea of your chances of getting a new credit card or loan application approved, and with a decent interest rate.
If you don't know your current credit score, make sure to get your free credit score from Borrowell today."

The government’s own council’s take on the law has been preciously guarded from public scrutiny.
Bill 32, titled “Restoring Balance in Alberta’s Workplace Act,” puts restrictions on the spending of labour unions, limits their picketing practices, and allows union certification to be delayed. For all workers, it will permit reductions in overtime pay.
The United Conservative Party (UCP) positions the bill as a fulfillment of their election-time guarantee to “bring balance back to Alberta’s labour laws” and to “restore workplace democracy.” Bill 32 had its second reading adjourned July 20.
Under the UCP, unions in Alberta have been waging active public campaigns, research initiatives, and lawsuits against spending cuts or freezes, mass layoffs and changes to the labour code. Colin Feasby, a Managing Partner at a Calgary law firm, affiliated with neither party nor union, writes, in his constitutional study of Bill 32, that it is a “paradigmatic example” of legislative power being used to “silence or impair the efficacy of political opponents.”
The bill coincides with plans by the UCP to remove limits on third party election spending. Associations of large corporate donors that slant towards the UCP spent twice as much in advertising during Alberta’s 2019 election as big NDP leaning, largely union, groups. The limits on union spending and formation that this legislation introduces may add further imbalance.
Consulting for Bill 32
Consultations with unions for this string of reforms to the Labour Relations Code were carried out with the government in December. According to Unifor, unions were given short notice and had an hour to make their case. The UFCW attended but expressed similar concerns over a process that “looked like anything but real consultation.”
Employers and employer associations were also consulted. Their general responses were publicly logged by the UCP. Their opinions on picketing rights and union certification expressly diverged from those of unions and bear a close resemblance to provisions within Bill 32.  
The Post Millennial contacted the office of the Minister of Labour and Immigration and was informed that they could not provide the names of the companies that participated in the consultation.
In the bill’s drafting, the UCP received legal opinions from its lawyers. The government has refused to release these opinions. Emails on the matter secured through an access to information request were found to be heavily and unusually redacted.
The professional legal analyses that have emerged strongly suggest that the bill will be found to be in violation of the constitution’s section two protections of freedom of expression and assembly.
Letting employers “respond”
Bill 32 would remove timelines for union certification votes. Typically, once the Labour Relations Board approves a vote for unionization in a workplace, ballots must start rolling out within five business days. Bill 32 replaces this mandatory timeline for a vote that is held “as soon as possible.”
Submissions from businesses consulted for the law complain that they “have less time to respond to certification applications than unions have to prepare the applications” creating “hardship for employers.”
According to Philippe—a Unifor labour organizer who agreed to speak under the condition of anonymity—the bill could indeed lead to a lengthier process; endangering a successful vote for unionization.
Philippe’s job is to assist union drives in Alberta. He says that the time between workers’ application for certification and the vote itself (which happens afterwards) can already reach three to six weeks – all after several months of workers organizing support and signing membership cards for a union within their workplace.
“If employers have not already started, they kick into a high gear at this point. There’s mandatory meetings. HR comes down, starts talking with employees. They put forward their position to convince employees not to unionize.”
In Philippe's experience, workers often begin unionization efforts in response to poor or uneven working conditions, mistreatment, or bad hours. Although the benefits of unionizing for workers are well-studied in Canada, Philippe reports that bosses will often misrepresent what unionizing will entail to protect their bottom line.
Canadian research suggests that 60 percent of employers overtly oppose union drives. 20 percent resort to illegal action.
“A lot of people… they’re weary,” adds Philippe. “There are protections in the labour code and in a perfect world they would work. But, I always tell people, in a perfect world everything would be fine and you wouldn’t be calling me.”
Although the Labour Relations Board takes complaints of threats and intimidation by employers seriously, evidential burdens can require workers to testify, a choice many are unwilling to make.
Bill 32 builds upon earlier UCP legislation. It used to be sufficient that 65 percent of workers sign a membership card or petition to unionize. The party brought in a mandatory accompanying vote that significantly extended the process for certification.
Similar legislation passed in Manitoba in 2016 tripled the number of failed union drives.
Crossing the picket line
Other provisions in Bill 32 restrict striking workers from “obstructing or impeding” a person from crossing a picket line. Picket lines are often erected outside the workplace following a bargaining impasse to prevent a company's normal flow of business. Picket lines are typically crossed by replacement workers, informally known as “scabs,” and employers who want to maintain revenues without having to reach an agreement with striking employees.
“To break a bargaining impasse, the norm all across Canada is strike for a union, lockout for an employer,” explains Bob Barnetson, a professor of labour relations at Athabasca University. “The strategy of workers is, during a strike, to picket an employer, or allies of that employer to exert pressure such that an employer says it's better to come to an agreement.”
The UCP passed legislation in 2019 to allow companies to hire replacement workers during strikes. This practice was illegal in Alberta, and continues to be in BC and Quebec, because of the upper hand it gives to employers in negotiations by severing their reliance on their workforce.  
“An employer has their own way of getting workers to come to an agreement,"" notes Barnetson. ""They stop paying them, they lock them out.”
Barnetson adds that bargaining impasses are rare in Alberta. Striking is usually a tool of last resort.
At the moment, electrical workers in BC are some of the only workers currently on strike in Canada. They are protesting increasingly dangerous working conditions and significant layoffs in 2019. In Alberta, grocery store workers at a subsidiary of Empire Co., voted yes to strike in late June after their $2 an hour wage increase was cut.
Other grocery workers are currently voting to strike in Newfoundland after Loblaw cut their pandemic pay. These cuts at Empire Co. and Loblaws were widely condemned. The industry’s profits were on the rise both before and during the pandemic.
In consultations with the government over Bill 32, businesses and business groups advocated for “stronger protections against picketing” and were of “opposing opinion on the issue” with unions.
The bill also prohibits secondary picketing unless permission is granted from the Labour Relations Board. Secondary picketing is the act of exerting pressure on employers by targeting “allies” such as popular suppliers of their products.
Managing union money
Bill 32 will require members of a labour union to opt-in to their union’s funding of “political activities and other causes.”  
The exact nature of “political activities and other causes” is left broad in the bill, but would include union funding for “general social causes or issues.”
An opt-in option would mean less money for unions to spend on these “political” activities. Workers looking to support a campaign would have to accept giving extra money to the union.  
At the moment, the money unions spend on public campaigns is collected with all other mandatory dues. In large Alberta unions like UFCW Local 401, the process for deciding what political causes to support is passed on to the rank and file members at meetings where votes and discussions are held on policy.
“It’s a democratic union,” comments Matthew Gilks, an oilsands worker in Kearl lakes and a leading member of Local 401. “So I have a meeting next week about Bill 1 and 32. We discuss what issues we find with it. Do we do letter writing campaigns, emails, do we get memes together? We pick the strategies we want to use, vote on it, and go from there.”
Alberta’s teachers union, the ATA, is a case study in the public campaigns unions engage in. In 2019, the UCP froze the budget for kindergarten to grade 12 education despite a substantial net increase in students. $428 million in grants were cut as well. These grants were only partially replaced by a one time grant of $128 million. On a smaller budget, the Calgary Board of Education (CBE) cut 300 teachers.
Recent cuts unique to Alberta during Canada’s COVID-19 response, meant the lay off of roughly 26,000 workers in education. At the CBE, between 600 and 800 support staff are not expected to return.
The ATA, which had a total membership of 51,390 in 2019, has been active in the media and has worked on disseminating public information about the effects of these cuts. They helped secure increased funding to reduce class sizes under the previous NDP government—funding that led to 2,900 additional teachers.
“Somebody needs to be a voice for the students, the teachers, and the community. If you limit this voice and what we can and cannot say, it becomes problematic,” Jason Schilling, president of the ATA remarked on Bill 32.  
Other unions like the AUPE, the UNA, the CUPE, and Alberta’s union coalition, the AFL, have joined the ATA in campaigning against budget cuts. In 2019, the UCP legislated spending freezes in the health and social service sector, continued wage freezes with plans to reduce wages between two and five percent, and gave notice that up to 6,000 public sector employees would be laid off. Union organizing helped lead to large protests in 2019 and 2020.
All of the unions listed above have released statements condemning Bill 32."
0,2020-07-14T13:32:01.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/ontarios-political-advertising-laws-need-an-overhaul,Ontario’s political advertising laws need an overhaul,"Political advertising laws in Ontario need an overhaul before big-headed bureaucrats at Elections Ontario do further damage to free speech in the province.
The most recent and troubling interpretation of the legislation that purports to govern political speech, the Ontario Election Finances Act, involves a so-called violation by a small and relatively new grassroots organization called Vaughan Working Families (not to be confused with Working Families, a union backed advocacy group).
The GTA based organization ran ads in February in print newspapers in Toronto. The ads slammed teachers unions for treating students as pawns in the province wide strikes.
Policy advocacy groups are an important part of our democracy, and this type of advertising is an important part of public discourse. Unions certainly advertised in favour of the strike, so grassroots groups ought to be able to advertise against the strike.
But not according to Elections Ontario.
The fatal mistake apparently made by Vaughan Working Families, a GTA group that ran paper based ads exclusively in Toronto, is that they ran the ads in Toronto while there were two by-elections taking place nearly 400 kilometers away in Ottawa.
If this seems confusing, that’s because it is. And it isn’t even a correct interpretation of the law.
The first problem is that what Vaughan Working Families did should not even constitute a ""political advertisement."" The ads were about a public policy issue that has existed in Ontario for decades – the compensation and performance of public school teachers. The teachers unions are not a candidate in any election, the ads didn’t talk about any elections or any politicians. The ads had absolutely nothing to do with Ottawa or the by-elections taking place there.
To make matters more suspicious, the teachers unions ran ads throughout the election, but their advertising was not considered ""political advertising"" under the Act. We know this, because this Elections Ontario said so to Vaughan Working Families. Their lawyer, Stephen Thiele, asked Elections Ontario about the ETFO anti-Ford ads.
""Elections Ontario did not view the ETFO advertising that was directed against the government as political advertising because it was consistent with previous advertising they had conducted, and was within the normal parameters of promoting their activity,"" Thiele said.
Essentially, this interpretation of the legislation by Elections Ontario is grandfathering the speech of established union organizations like ETFO, while restricting the speech of new grassroots organizations.
The second issue is that even under the Act, Vaughan Working Families should not have been required to register. Elections Ontario claims that the Vaughan Working Families ads were a violation because the group failed to register with them. Section 37.5 of the Ontario Election Finances Act requires a third party group to register with elections Ontario when they have spent more than $500 in a by-election or general election. But the provision goes on to clarify that the spending must be within the ""electoral district"" (see s. 37.10.1 and s. 38(1))
We know that Vaughan Working Families did not spend any money in the electoral district where the by-election was taking place. The ads only ran in the Toronto copies of the papers. There was no advertising in Ottawa, and therefore, there should be no violation.
To accept Elections Ontario’s absurd interpretation of the law would mean that running an ad about a local issue in Sarnia would contravene the Act because there was a by-election taking place in Thunder Bay. It could also mean that a government intent on limiting any third party adverting during the year could stagger by-elections, creating a de facto permanent publication ban.
This legislation needs to be drastically modified. The types of restrictions being contemplated by the bureaucrats running Elections Ontario are resulting in violations of the Charter protected right to free expression. The interpretation allows for preferential treatment of established groups, and the subjectivity in how the law is being applied is resulting in apparent political preferences in prosecution.
Speech on important public policy issues, like our education system, should be encouraged. It is good for democracy for the public to be exposed to competing points of view, and this type of speech should not be shut down because there is an unrelated by-election taking place hundreds of kilometers away.
Without an overhaul, these laws will not withstand scrutiny by the courts. And there is no doubt that such a challenge to these laws is on the horizon.

""Dr. Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public but he has been wrong about everything I have ever interacted with him on,"" said Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser.
""Now Fauci is saying that a falling mortality rate doesn't matter, when it is the single most important statistic to help guide the pace of our economic reopening. So when you ask me if I listen to Dr. Fauci's advice, my answer is only with caution.""
White House officials suggested that Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been giving faulty advice since the beginning of the pandemic and has made the wrong choice on a number of occasions, according to CBS News.
Polling shows that despite the uncertainty about Fauci in the White House, he is still trusted by the majority of Americans.
In the US, cases are spiking in over 30 states which has resulted in some governors halting phased economic reopenings and reimposing restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Fauci was told not to join a press briefing on Wednesday with other White House members of the coronavirus task force which took place at the Department of Education. He did however, make an appearance at Friday’s task force briefing.
President Trump has attributed the sudden rise in cases to increased testing throughout the country and is continuing to push for the country to reopen. He also disagreed with Fauci’s belief that the US is ""knee deep"" in the pandemic’s first wave and has to make serious changes right away.
""I think we are in a good place,"" said President Trump at the time. ""I disagree with him. You know, Dr. Fauci said 'don't wear masks,' and now he says 'wear them.' And you know, he's said numerous things. 'Don't close off China. Don't ban China.' And I did it anyway. I sort of didn't listen to my experts and I banned China.""
In another interview, Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity that Fauci ""is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes.""
In an interview with FiveThirtyEight’s podcast, Fauci said, ""when you compare us to other countries, I don't think you can say we're doing great. I mean, we're just not.""
He also disagreed with President Trump’s view that the lowering mortality rate means the virus is coming under control. Fauci said that it’s ""a false narrative to take comfort in a lower death rate.""
""There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus,"" Fauci said. ""Don't get yourself into false complacency.""
When speaking with the Financial Times, Fauci said he has not briefed the President in over two months.
According to Worldometers, the US has seen almost 3.5 million cases. Of those there are currently 1,782,928 active cases, and more than 1.5 million recoveries. Deaths have reached nearly 140,000. Of the active cases, 15,823 are critical."
0,2020-07-13T14:52:16.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/exclusive-into-the-party-line-of-2020s-conservative-leadership-race,EXCLUSIVE: Into the party line of 2020’s Conservative leadership race,"Come August, Peter MacKay and Erin O’Toole are expected to be at the top of Conservatives' ballots.
MacKay was a prominent cabinet minister in both terms of the Harper administration. O’Toole was a military retiree elected in a 2012 by-election, entering cabinet only in the administration's final year.
The two front runners have released platforms that deviate little from the project of Canada’s previous and existing Conservative administrations. In the wake of COVID-19, they are calling for tax cuts, slashing the debt, cutting regulations, expanding free trade, and growing the oil and gas sector.  
Tax Cuts
Disdain for “big government” is the bedrock of the platforms of O'Toole and MacKay. In the words of O'Toole, it is only once the government is “out of the way” can a Conservative administration “unleash the private sector.”
To do so, MacKay promises a “comprehensive review of our tax system” that would make us “competitive with the United States.” He envisions a reduction in the Capital Gains tax—the tax on money accrued through investment and real estate.
Although spicing his proposals with condemnations of the wealthy, O’Toole similarly suggests cutting taxes “for all businesses” so as to “reduce, flatten, and considerably simplify taxes.”
“The trouble with tax cuts is a company can use them for anything,” says Robert Chernomas, an economist at the University of Manitoba. “When the government spends, the money then gets directly injected into the economy. There’s no money that’s going to stock buybacks or invested in China or Mexico.”
When MacKay was in cabinet, his administration saw the lowering of the corporate income tax from 22.1 percent in 2007 to 15 percent by 2012. By 2013, the world’s leading financial institutions determined that business tax rates in Canada were some of the lowest in the world.
Yet, as taxes fell, private investment in the Canadian economy fell equally as rapidly. Meanwhile, corporate tax reserves (referred to by the Bank of Canada as “dead money”) increased substantially. Finance Canada estimated that strategic public investment could have resulted in five times the number of jobs—and economic stimulus—as the equivalent given in tax cuts.
Still, O’Toole and MacKay highlight that lower taxes will help small and medium sized businesses, an assurance to the sector that they pack in with other policy proposals.
Chernomas says that while tax cuts for smaller businesses are an option, money may be better invested by opening government contracts through infrastructure investment, by ensuring consumers have money to spend, and by publicly funding health services otherwise provided by employers through benefits.
Slashing Debt
But an emphasis on government spending is out of step with the philosophy of the MacKay and O’Toole project. Both stress a need to “return to balanced budgets,” after the epidemic. O’Toole even suggests a “Pay-as-You-Go rule” that would require a government to find one dollar in savings for each new dollar spent.
Projections for Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio after COVID-19 hover around 50 percent. This is considerably smaller than past deficits that went as high as 109 percent in 1946.
“What did we do in 1946?” asks Chernomas by way of providing a model. “Did we start cutting taxes to bring those deficits down? The answer is that the government did the opposite. We began to spend in Canada. And what happened to our big debt? The economy grew much faster than our debt and it gradually disappeared.”
MacKay and O’Toole both point to a more recent history in the way of a counter-example on dealing with deficits: Harper’s handling of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
The debt-reduction strategy pursued by Harper (focused on reducing spending) saw 25,000 public sector positions liquidated between 2011 and 2015. The public was assured that these were “backroom” positions.
Staff at Veterans Affairs were cut by 24 percent (mainly in those departments handling health, rehabilitation, and pensions,) the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was set to lose 1,407 full-time positions between 2012 and 2016 (leading to a reduction in food inspections), and the staff of Environment Canada was cut by 21 percent with 338 people forced to leave the climate-change division alone.
O’Toole’s only and brief experience in cabinet was as Minister of Veterans Affairs, repairing relationships with Afghanistan veterans who had launched a class action after an overhaul of their benefits.
Cutting Red Tape
Following the philosophy of small government, the Conservative front runners adamantly push a “red tape” reduction program. MacKay attributes the failure of several industrial sectors, namely Canada’s tech and manufacturing industry, to abundant “red tape.” O’Toole wants to task a minister with tabling at least one “Red Tape Reduction Act” every year.
Neither are clear on precise policies that would be associated with reducing regulations.
Nonetheless, the Harper government had a similar strategy of red tape reduction. The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) had its budget cut by 43 percent in 2012. The committee set up to review the CEAA issued a report that lifted language “verbatim” from the recommendations of industry lobbyists.
Today’s $260 billion cost to clean up the oil sands is largely believed to be the consequence of a “flawed system” of industrial oversight.
The 2013 Lac-Megantic rail disaster which killed 47 people is cited as another notable consequence of the weak regulatory structure maintained under the Conservatives. It had meant fewer inspections, increasing rail shipments, and deferred maintenance for crumbling infrastructure.
Expanding Free Trade
Along with reducing red-tape, O’Toole and MacKay plan on increasing free trade. They diverge somewhat on specifics.
O’Toole looks to make big corporations compete by exposing Canadian companies like our “airline and wireless services to foreign competition.” O’Toole plans to “aggressively pursue” export markets, particularly through trade agreements with Latin America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK.
MacKay wants unfair trade practices to be squashed, an end to outsourcing to “places like China,” and trade missions to regain “lost” export markets.  
Following the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the EU (negotiated by the Harper administration, signed by the Liberals,) Canadian exports to the region remained essentially flat. However, imports from countries in the EU increased by over a third, leading Canada’s trade deficit with the EU to double in two years from $1.5 billion to $3.43 billion.
Canada cannot compete domestically with the EU’s sophisticated manufacturing sector. With CETA in place, Bombardier famously lost a billion dollar contract in Canada to Germany’s Siemens.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the largest trade deals in world history, saw Canada sign on to an agreement with Pacific Rim countries like Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. This was championed by the government of O’Toole and MacKay as decreasing tariffs on key Canadian exports.
96.8 percent of Canada’s exports already faced no trade barriers in the region. By signing on with manufacturing giants like Japan, Canada lowered its tariffs for countries it imports from twice as much as it exports to.
Canada's high imports of manufactured products are attributed by some for accounting for the loss of roughly 500,000 manufacturing jobs in Canada between 2001 and 2014.
Through Harper’s Americas Strategy, free trade agreements were signed throughout Latin America, increasing Canadian trade by 33 percent between 2006 and 2012. The Canadian mining industry now accounts for 41 percent of mining in the region (although returns for Canadians are extremely minimal from these operations).
These agreements created Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanisms that allow multinationals to sue signatories to a trade deal in a private tribunal.
The ISDS mechanism was cancelled in NAFTA after Canada became the most-sued country under the treaty. Nonetheless, Canadian companies remain highly litigious in Latin America where the ISDS continues to exist, with governments currently facing billions in fines for having diminished corporations’ profitability—typically in ecologically sensitive agricultural communities whose livelihoods are threatened by mining.
Shelving Emissions Targets
Outside of their plans for oil and gas, both MacKay and O’Toole have few substantial proposals for lowering carbon emissions.
MacKay proposes investments in carbon sequestration, conservation efforts, and “clean” technologies. O’Toole offers the same, while further proposing to build nuclear energy and to retrofit buildings for extreme weather.
Neither outline an exact strategy for Canada to meet its international commitments.
Despite a small population, Canada is frequently ranked as the tenth largest emitter of greenhouse gas in the world. It is the third largest in per capita terms. Of major polluters, it is one of the wealthiest and most industrialized.
Under the Paris Climate Accord, Canada pledged to keep temperature increases under 2C by getting emissions 30 percent below 2005 levels (conservative estimates now suggest that this target would only keep temperatures below 3C). MacKay is forthright: “these targets are aspirational,” those who claim that Canada will be a net-zero emitter in the coming decades “make empty and meaningless pledges.”
Both candidates suggest dismantling current environmental legislation like Bill C-48, C-69 (governing environmental assessments), and Trudeau’s carbon pricing regime. MacKay sums up the common sentiment underlying their approach: “There is perhaps no single more important initiative that Canada could undertake to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions than to export our liquefied natural gas.”
China is the focus of this export strategy.
Ian Hussey, research manager at the Parkland Institute, considers the expectation that Canada would fill Chinese oil and gas demand, to be based largely on misconceptions of Canada’s export capacity and international demand.
“China has access to many other sources of oil. There are direct pipelines from Russia into China,” said Hussey. “China also imports oil from North Africa and the Middle East. These are cheaper on a cost and transportation basis.”
Despite being able to send shipments to Asia, virtually no oil is being shipped to markets other than the West Coast of the US from Vancouver ports.
As for whether Canadian oil will be key in transitioning to a low-carbon future: “It’s just a scientific fact that Alberta oil is among the most GHG intensive in the world,” notes Hussey.
Alberta bitumen is the fourth most carbon-intensive oil on earth, releasing 70 percent more GHG emissions than the average crude oil produced elsewhere.
Unconventional gas, on the other hand, the majority of Canada’s remaining gas supply, leaks substantial amounts of methane in its extraction and combustion. If exported to China, Canadian LNG would mean at least 18.5 percent more emissions in the next two decades compared to the alternatives China is currently employing in their transition from old low-efficiency coal power plants.
With oil and gas heavy in GHG emissions, existing pipelines and rail capacity are sufficient, according to analysts, to meet forecast production under Alberta’s emissions caps.
Pushing Oil and Gas
However, both O’Toole and MacKay see potential for economic growth and satisfying domestic demand through expanding infrastructure projects. Mentions of Indigenous communities are virtually confined to the partnerships they offer through these projects.
O’Toole ambitiously suggests that he will “propose” a strategy in North America to end imports of oil from outside the continent. He plans to grow the transportation of natural gas by pipeline, to scrap the Northern drilling ban, while supporting an act to expedite “nationally strategic” pipelines. MacKay draws out these policies in more general strokes while offering tax cuts for exploration projects and an end to imports of foreign oil.
“The reality is, in Canada, the oil industry is run by private businesses, it’s not run by the government,” says Hussey. “It’s a company's decision whether they want to buy foreign oil or to use Alberta bitumen.”
Hussey added that there is uncertainty in how demand for oil will rebound after COVID-19. He notes that most reputable analysts, save the International Energy Agency, believe the price per barrel will not soar back to previous heights.
Investing in infrastructure for oil and gas entails multi-billion dollar projects and is often seen as “locking-in” energy consumption. This helps dissuade investments in renewable energy and an economy compatible with shifts in energy use.
Hussey’s own research notes that the job opportunities in the oil and gas sector have fallen with innovation. Though production has grown in the past decade, increasing labor productivity suggests the thousands of jobs lost between 2014 and 2016 will not be coming back.
Moreover, more than half of those currently employed are in temporary construction projects.
Canada’s share of the profits from the sector has also fallen. The effective royalty rate in Alberta fell from 19.5 percent in 2000 to 5.1 percent in 2017, meaning a loss of billions. Corporate taxes paid by the sector are half what they were in 2006 and were less than $4 billion in 2015. Recent tax cuts announced in Alberta will further reduce these revenues.
Nonetheless, the industry still receives significant subsidies from the federal government. In 2018 alone it received at least $3.3 billion in government funding. The number is likely much higher with limited public information. O’Toole initially proposed ending subsidies but removed this from his platform.
In advocating for increased public spending, Chernomas suggests that government money is better placed phasing into a “labour intensive Green economy.” Some of Canada’s most detailed research into the matter suggests substantial investments are required in constructing transit lines, retrofitting buildings, research, green manufacturing and waste management.
Canada’s renewable energy sector currently accounts for roughly 300,000 jobs and is growing at a rate faster than the economy.
These approaches claim to reduce the heavy price tag associated with cleaning up orphan wells, oil spills, toxic tailings ponds, and dealing with the economic impacts of climate change."

The sanctions were imposed because of alleged human rights abuses aimed at religious and ethnic minorities detained in China, according to Global News.
The three Chinese officials targeted were Chen Quanguo, Politburo member and Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous party secretary; Zhu Hailun, legal committee and Xinjiang political party secretary; and Wang Mingshan, Xinjiang public security bureau party secretary.
The members and their immediate family cannot enter the United States.
The administration announced visa bans only a day earlier against officials who barred foreigners from accessing Tibet. Thursday's move is a big one and will likely receive a tough response from Beijing.
This decision is among other recent measures taken by the Trump administration against China. Relations have begun to deteriorate between the two countries over the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the appearing CCP annexation of Hong Kong, human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority, and trade.
The measures also come as President Donald Trump continues to place blame on China for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
""The United States will not stand idly by as the Chinese Communist Party carries out human rights abuses targeting Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang, to include forced labour, arbitrary mass detention, and forced population control, and attempts to erase their culture and Muslim faith,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo noted in a statement.
Pompeo’s statement also touched on additional visa restrictions on Chinese Communist Party officials responsible or partly responsible for unjust abuse or detention of ethic Kazakhs, Uyghurs and other minority group members.
The Chinese government, in recent years, has detained approximately 1 million or more ethnic Turkic minorities. They have held the minorities in internment prisons and camps where they face ideological discipline, have to denounce their language and religion and are physically abused.
The Communist Chinese government denied that the internment camps existed at first but has now rebranded them as vocational training facilities that are intended to counter separatist tendencies and Muslim radicalism.
Congress largely supported Trump-signed legislation last month, mandating that individuals responsible for oppressing Uyghurs face sanctions. The law also makes it mandatory for US individuals and businesses that operate in or sell products to Xinjiang make sure they are not contributing to any human rights violations, including forced labour."

The rule will have a large impact on companies providing the US government with goods and services as they will have to verify that they aren’t using products from these companies—though some of them are among the world's top sellers in cameras and surveillance equipment. The rule will take effect on August 13.
The news follows rising tensions between China and the US over China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a trade war lasting nearly two years, as well as China’s actions in Hong Kong.
Companies using services or equipment from the five Chinese companies will require a government waiver to sell to the US government.
The White House says that the rule won’t be delayed in being enacted and it could be difficult to get waivers. A national security analysis will have to be conducted by agencies before a waiver is granted by the administration.
Over $500 billion in contracts are awarded by the US government every year, according to the Government Accountability Office.
""The danger our nation faces from foreign adversaries like China looking to infiltrate our systems is great,"" noted acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought.
""The Trump Administration is keeping our government strong against nefarious networks like Huawei by fully implementing the ban on Federal procurement.""
It is still unclear as to whether the rule will be enforced on current contracts. For example, in April, Amazon.com Inc used 1,500 cameras from Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. Ltd. to take worker's temperatures.
Amazon has been working against Microsoft to land the Pentagon’s cloud computing deal worth as much as $10 million.
An official familiar with the rule said it intends to limit the influence of these Chinese firms and will allow companies to choose whether they want to continue doing business with the Chinese companies or the US government.
Huawei and Hikvision were among some of the companies placed on the US government’s economic blacklist which requires them to gain the government’s approval before purchasing components from US companies."

Woo recently asked the Parliamentary Budget Office to calculate how much universal basis income would cost to implement for six months, to all Canadians. The PBO estimates the project could cost anywhere between $47.5 billion to $98 billion. Ultimately, that number would depend on how much the government would take back from Canadians who earned other income.
The PBO made their analysis based on the universal basic income pilot project that was launched in Ontario under the Liberal government. Under that project, individuals would receive a total of $16,989 a year and couples would receive $24,027. The program was later shut down by Doug Ford's administration after he came into power.
The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) which was ushered in to help Canadians deal with the economic hardships brought on by the pandemic is set to expire in October, however Canada's economic future is still very uncertain. This is why, in part, Woo thinks its a good time to test out universal basic income.
""We already have a number of basic income-type measures, you know, wage supplement, guaranteed income supplement, childcare benefit and so on. So this is not, in principle, different from those, but it would have a wider coverage. But the underlying principle here is that all Canadians are vulnerable to shocks in the economy, shocks in their personal lives that may put them in a situation where they are, all of a sudden, vulnerable. And we saw that very starkly in the COVID-19 crisis."" said Woo in an interview with Nil Koksal on As It Happens.
Woo said that the program would not provide people with lavish lifestyles, but rather give them the freedom to make better decisions: ""The basic income does not provide for a lavish lifestyle, not by any means, but it provides individuals with, fundamentally provides them with freedom. Freedoms to, obviously, house themselves, feed themselves, freedoms to pursue education, for example, to not put themselves in precarious situations. These are particularly important for disadvantaged communities. You know, whether we're talking about a lot of First Nations communities and other racialized minorities.""
""If there's one thing we've learned from the COVID-19 crisis is that there are many gaps in our social safety net system. And there seems to be a determination on the part of Canadians of all political stripes to patch these gaps. Basic income would be one way of doing that."" added Woo.
Woo believes the pandemic is as good place to test out the project, saying, ""I don't underestimate the political challenges, but this is an opportunity that's before us. We all know that major social policy reform happens after big crises — you know, after the war and after the Depression and so on. This may be the equivalent for Canada and other Western industrialized countries.""
""It will take a leap of faith. And that's why I'm saying that this is an opportunity for us to, at the very least, conduct an experiment, if you will. Maybe a time-limited experiment that can be used to demonstrate if, in fact, [there are] benefits."""

In addition to that, the province will also make wearing face masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces, according to the Montreal Gazette.
Wearing masks in all indoor public spaces will come into effect June 20. The announcement is expected to be made Thursday morning in Montreal at a press conference where Horacio Arruda, Quebec's public health director will be speaking.
Bars will be shut down at midnight beginning this weekend, and any customers attending those establishments before the cut-off period will be required to register their names upon entry so that they can be traced if another outbreak occurs.
Physical distancing measures will apply up until the cut-ff period, meaning dance floors are forbidden and bars cannot accept over 50 percent of their regular capacity.
The Corporation des propriétaires de bars, brasseries et tavernes du Québec (CPBBTQ) is angry with Quebec Premier Francois Legault, whom they claim lied to them about supporting them through the pandemic.
“This government has lied to us from the very beginning of this crisis, promising to respect our industry and to help us financially, especially when it came to establishing fair measures for all bar owners,” said Renaud Poulin, director of the CPBBTQ.
Poulin said the province's recent decision to close down the bars will “push the owners of hundreds of bars into bankruptcy.”
Pierre Thibault, of the Nouvelle Association des Bars du Québec (NABQ), is also frustrated at the fact that bars haven't been able to operate since March 15 and had only just begun to resume business before being shut down again. Thibault is no turning to Pierre Fitzgibbon, Quebec's Minster of Economic Development for help, asking that he intervene with the latest decision.
“It’s simply not possible to tell businesspeople that they won’t help them,” said Thibault. “When it comes to the automobile or aerospace sector, there’s always compensation, but when it comes to bars we’re never taken seriously.”
The bar industry in Quebec represents 2,000 establishments and employs over 25,000 people and many are now left feeling abandoned by the government. Thibault supports the existing health regulations and wishes to stay open and abide by them."

“He has done less to address police brutality and violence than even Trump has done. And  that is shameful,” said Singh during a press conference on Parliament Hill on Wednesday.
Singh was highly critical of Trudeau's response to defunding the police and reviewing RCMP practices, citing that Trudeau had previously asked Canadians to judge him by actions following the 2019 scandal of the Prime Minister photographed in blackface, saying that if that is the metric from which Trudeau would like to be judged, he still has not done enough.
“This is a moment right now, this is a movement right now where we've seen people killed and brutalized by the police… and specifically, Indigenous people and racialized people. So in light of that… why is the prime minister, simply giving symbolic gestures and saying words instead of doing something concrete?” said Singh.
“We are of course in a difficult situation. Instead of cutting help to people who are desperate, who are in need… the Liberal government should actually focus on making sure those who can pay, those who are the wealthiest... are paying their fair share,” said @theJagmeetSingh pic.twitter.com/xTgIZRHbcp— Power & Politics (@PnPCBC) July 8, 2020
U.S. President Trump signed an executive order that would encourage better police practices in mid-June, following weeks of mass protests, Trump did not however mention the ongoing race relations in America at the time.
Following that order, Trudeau spoke on the issue of Canadian institutions being host to systemic racism, such as the RCMP which he said would be equipping with body cameras.
While Singh has said that Trump still has more to do in fixing the problem of police brutality, he said that Trudeau's actions are even less significant, particularly regarding the lack of policy change and legislation.
“Nothing in legislation, no changes to policy at all,” said Singh, calling Trudeau's lack of response “very troubling.”
“We don't need the prime minister to take a knee, we need the prime minister to take a stand,” added Singh.
Singh is asking that Trudeau act upon the unanimous calls of the NDP party's consent motion, which was struck down by one Bloc Quebecois MP and supported by the Liberal caucus. The motion was to have the RCMP budget reviewed and to have certain resources be reallocated to community agencies, as well as a review conducted to the RCMP's use of force and a commitment by the police to cease racial profiling."
0,2020-07-08T11:31:03.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/chair-of-finance-committee-goes-after-payday-loans-calling-them-ungodly,"Chair of finance committee goes after payday loans, calling them 'ungodly'","The Liberal chair of the Commons finance committee, MP Wayne Easter, is trying to change to regulations surrounding payday loans, according to Blacklock's Reporter, who yesterday referred them 'ungodly.'
Interest rates over 60 percent were made illegal by the Criminal Code, but in 2007 Parliament made an exemption for payday lenders from the usury law and the provinces were left to determine their own regulations from there.  The Parliament's usury law was written in 1978 and has not been rewritten since.
Easter made the remarks after new data revealed that eight percent of Canadian single parents are borrowing money at interest rates that could be considered highly unfair.
“What’s the regular interest rate on payday loans? It is desperately, desperately high,” said MP Wayne Easter (Malpeque, P.E.I.): “You pay high fees. The cost may be equivalent to an interest rate of 500 or 600 percent. That’s usury. That’s ungodly. I know they’re legal but, man, we’ve got to do something about that.”
Interest on a two-week payday loan can be charged at the equivalent of 800 percent annually, for example a loan of $100 could be charged at $31, as determined by the Senate banking committee during the 2018 hearings.
A 2019 federal Financial Capabilities Survey found that 2 percent of Canadians are payday borrowers.
“But then you see that percentage rising for specific vulnerable subgroups,” said Ruth Stephen, research director for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. “For example, four percent of low-income households use payday loans,” continued Stephen. “It’s eight percent of Indigenous people and three percent of individuals with lower educational attainment, and eight percent of single parents.”
“I’m absolutely shocked there’s eight percent of Indigenous people and eight percent of single parents using payday loans,” said Chair Easter. “I never realized it was anywhere near there.”
The last Parliament saw the lapse of a private Liberal bill, entitled bill S-237 An Act To Amend The Criminal Code, which was designed to cap payday loans and all interest at 45 percent. Unfortunately the bill failed, as have similar bills in the past such as in 2005 and 2015.
Some courts have ruled against lenders as the payday rates have become so high. For example, in 2019, the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench ruled against a lender over their 164 percent loan, under the Unconscionable Transactions Act. The court called the interest rate ""grossly disproportionate.""
In Ontario, using the provincial Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act, a Small Claims Court ruled against a 548 percent interest loan in 2018.
Similarly in 2019, British Columbia Provincial Court called a pawnbroker's 300 percent loan ""a criminal rate.""

The police budget will be reduced by $11 million spread over the next two years and that money will be reinvested into supportive housing as part of the new provisions being brought forth.
“My hope is other agencies out there may bring some money to the table and some resources as well and realize collectively we are much more effective if we do it together than if we do it in isolation and silos,” said Chief Dale McFee.
McFee said the commission had previously asked for budget cuts to the Edmonton Police Service because of strains brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The budget cut will help the commission with enacting their new policing plan entitled, “Vision 2020,” which is geared toward helping the homeless. McFee is hoping that the reallocation of funds will help with more coordination amongst the police and social agencies.
“We’ll start to realize when it comes to our vulnerable population, community safety in relation to this population is way bigger than the police,” said McFee. ""But if we collectively use our money, our resources, and our people to find better outcomes and to off-ramp them from the (justice) system, this actually could be a very good thing that could actually save a lot of money for the citizens of Edmonton, and more importantly give better outcomes for the people that actually need the services.”
Among the motions recently approved by city council was a submission to Alberta's Solicitor General to review the province's Police Act. An independent oversight into handling public complaints regarding police conduct such as ASIRT, is also being advocated for the council. In addition to that the council is looking for a better way to hold Transit Peace Officers more accountable in instances where they use excessive force.
A public task force will be responsible for implementing much these new provisions which aims to have terms of reference before city council by August. That would be the first step before positions of those who will oversee changes to the Edmonton Police Force could be filled.
“I think the most important part of this motion is indeed the task force,” said Councillor Ben Henderson. “I think (we) have a really remarkable opportunity, and I think this is the question that was raised by all the people we heard from, to be in the forefront of a real re-think about what we want to do with well-being in this city.”
Bylaw infractions for jaywalking, riding a bicycle on the sidewalk and loitering are also being reviewed.
Councillor Sarah Hamilton brought forth a motion to review the ConnectEdmonton goal which aims to make Edmonton that safest city in Canada by 2030.
“Edmonton has held the dubious title of one of the most unsafe cities in Canada,” said Hamilton. “Ten years ago we had the name ‘Stab-monton’ and our city routinely ranks high on the crime severity index which measures the amount of violent crime that happens per capita in each major city. In 2015 Edmonton earned the distinction of being the worst place to live in Canada if you’re a woman”
A potential new dispatch system which would combine 911 and 211 calls together is also being discussed which would stop armed police from being the first responders to mental health calls.
“We have to be prepared that the recommendations that come forward may be bold and transformative,” said Councillor Andrew Knack, who was responsible for tabling the original motion. “If that is what the community determines based on all of the best research, and analysis, we have to be ready not only to listen to that, but to follow it up and actually take action.”"

“It’s great that we have zero reported today, but that doesn’t mean we’ll continue to have zero,” said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health.
Yaffe did say that there is hope that COVID-19 deaths are in decline, given the low number of current patients in hospital, particularly those who require ventilators.
The downward trend in cases has been happening across the board, including the number of outbreaks at long-term care home. There is currently 34 outbreaks at long-term care homes across the province which have made up the bulk of the deaths as well as Ontarians over the age of 80.
Monday also saw an 0.4 percent increase of new infections with 154 new cases. Of Ontario's 34 public health units, 29 of them reported five cases or less.
Health Minister Christine Elliott tweeted, ""Today, Ontario is reporting 154 new cases of #COVID19, a 0.4% increase. Locally, 29 of the province’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with 18 of them reporting no new cases at all. Windsor-Essex is reporting four new cases today.""
The province has confirmed a total of 35,948 cases of COVID-19 since the outbreak began.
Mandatory face mask bylaws are being adopted by various municipalities at an increasing rate, as the province enters Stage 2 of its reopening plan.
The City of Toronto will begin its mandatory face mask policy as of Tuesday, with 430 cases per 100,000 residents, the city has the highest rate in Ontario.
Premier Doug Ford announced that the last two areas of the province to still be stuck in Stage 1 of reopening, Leamington and Kingsville, will move into Stage 2 on Tuesday as well. At which point Premier Ford can get a haircut, as he said we would wait until the entire province had entered Stage 2 which allows for barbers and salons to reopen.
On Monday, the Windsor-Essex region reported four new cases, a positive sign for an area that had several previous outbreaks of infections among farm workers.
“We’re fortunate we haven’t seen huge outbreaks and I think that’s very good news … we are looking to move into Stage 3 as soon as we possibly can, but that data is being assessed right now.” said Elliott on Monday.
Public health officials are now reviewing the data from across Ontario to decide when will be the best time to move into Stage 3, which would allow all businesses to be open with the exception of allowing fans to attend sporting events and large concerts."
0,2020-07-07T09:17:05.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/lewis-digital-surge-translating-to-real-world-momentum,Lewis' digital surge translating to real-world momentum,"Editor's Note: The original version of this article mistakingly stated that Lewis had the highest number of unique donors. She, in fact, had the highest number of unique donors in Q2, as well as the highest number of donations made.
Earlier this month, I wrote about Dr. Leslyn Lewis’ rapidly growing digital campaign to win the leadership of Conservative Party of Canada.
At the time, Facebook data showed that Lewis’s underdog campaign had effectively managed to beat each of her competitors in terms of per post engagement, while also rapidly approaching the O’Toole campaign in total engagement. She did this while spending only $300, which is only 0.5 percent of O’Toole’s, and 0.25 percent of Mackay’s total spending on Facebook ads.
Given the massive growth in social media engagement, many, including myself, wondered just how much of that digital voice would convert into real support. With second quarter fundraising now largely publicized in a report by Globe, the impact is finally on display, and the results are stunning.
While Erin O’Toole leads Q2 donations, and total unique donors and Mackay leads in terms of the total money raised, Lewis has taken the clear lead in terms of the most important numbers, highest unique donors in Q2, as well as highest number of donations made.
The massive donor lead Lewis gained during the second quarter is the strongest sign that her campaign has gained on-the-ground momentum, and thereby also a path to winning the race.
This is primarily because of the way the Conservative Leadership race is designed. In order to win, a candidate must secure 50 percent +1 of points, allocated to ridings across the country. If no candidate secures 50 percent +1 on the first ballot, the last place candidate is removed, and the votes of their supporters redistributed based on how they ranked each candidate.
Every riding is worth the same 100 points, regardless of the number of votes cast in the riding. So, individual votes from ridings with fewer members are actually worth more than a riding with a large number of voting party members.  
As a result, so long as no candidate wins in the first ballot, the candidate with the broadest support—including in areas where Conservatives lose—tends to pull through. We saw this occur in the last race, where Andrew Scheer, the second place on the first 13 rounds of voting, eventually squeaked through on the 14th ballot with less than 51 percent of the available points.
In this situation, it seems more and more likely that there will be no first ballot win as Peter Mackay, the candidate predicted to finish ahead, now has fewer donors than both Lewis and O’Toole, and finished second in terms of total donations in the second quarter.
In many ways, it seems polling released in May by Mainstreet research, which Mackay voters would be open to considering O’Toole, just as O’Toole voters would be open to considering Lewis, has seemingly been confirmed.
While this is a great sign for Lewis, there remain two serious problems, for her campaign.
Firstly, while Lewis has made a strong showing, she has a serious problem with Mackay voters, who would pick O’Toole over Lewis by large margins. In the case where Lewis does make it as second, it’s quite likely Peter Mackay would have to be third, giving O’Toole a large number of voters.
Secondly, this voting split is further amplified to the detriment of Lewis, by the very same rules around broad support. This is primarily due to the unique characteristics of Quebec, the only majority speaking French province in the country, and the location of the second most number of points available, right after Ontario.
In Quebec, I have been told Lewis continues to remain behind both her competitors, likely due to her limited ability to speak the language. A total loss in Quebec could kneecap just about any campaign.
Taken together, there are, at best, a few paths to victory for Lewis. She could finish first in the first ballot, and rely on O’Toole voters who are evenly divided between Mackay and Lewis, to push her over, or for Mackay voters to make a fairly large shift in their preferred voting habits.
While I wouldn’t hold my breath for the second of those paths, the truth is that the election has fundamentally changed since the field was first whittled down to the final four. At the start of this race, not many expected Lewis to even meet the fundraising or signature requirements to avoid disqualification.
Even as she met those requirements, the general conversation in both the media and the party remained around Peter Mackay and Erin O’Toole. Today, with almost two months left until the end of this race, Lewis certainly can’t be counted out.
Given this momentum, where do you think she’ll be on August 21st?"

The meme Trump posted showed him pointing a finger with a serious look on his face, alongside the caption: ""In reality they're not after me, they're after you, I'm just in the way.""
The photo of Trump was taken by a New York Times photographer in 2015, which was published beside an article about the then presidential candidate.
Raheem Kassam, of The National Pulse, took a screenshot of the meme and tweeted it out, saying: ""The New York Times filed a DMCA notice and forced Twitter to remove this meme from Donald Trump’s account. They say because they own the picture of him, he cannot share it without their permission. Don’t RT or they’ll get upset.""
The post is no longer visible on Trump's Twitter account.
This is not the first time Trump has been met with pushback from the social media giant. Earlier this month, Twitter took down a satirical video posted by Trump about CNN, and just a few days later had another tweet ""warning labeled"" for saying ""serious force"" would be used on those who chose to erect an autonomous zone in Washington, DC.
Trump had even gone so far as to say that the social media giant is now interfering in the 2020 election, which comes amid the Trump administration taking a look at Section 230—a piece of legislation that may be rolled back, thus eliminating many of the protections social media outlets have been protected under for years.
Facebook has also been a target of criticism for bowing to major advertisers and special interest groups demanding that the social media giant censor Trump ads and other content which violates their tender sensibilities."

Macdonald—just in time for Canada Day,"A statue of Sir John A. Macdonald in Regina's Victoria Park has become the subject of debate recently, prompting the City of Regina to collect the public's feedback on what to do next, according to the Winnipeg Sun.
So far, the City of Regina has hung a plaque at the bottom of the statue that is chained around Macdonald's feet with a ""trigger warning"" that acknowledges the controversial legacy of the country's first Prime Minister.
The message reads, “Recognizing that the Sir John A. Macdonald statue represents a harmful legacy to members of our community, the City of Regina is reaching out to Indigenous elders, artists, community members and other cultural groups. The City will seek guidance on responding to harmful legacies and increasing community understanding of Regina’s diverse histories. The general public will also have opportunity to be engaged,”
ADs
The City plans to consult with Indigenous elders, artists and community members along with other cultural groups on how they feel they should move forward as announced in a photo of the message and a tweet on the City of Regina's Twitter page.
A petition has been launched asking for the removal of the statue that has so far garnered about 2,500 signatures.
ADs
The statue has been vandalized several times over the past couple of years and was recently the site of a sit-in protest that was organized by Star Andreas and Kerry Bellegarde-Opoonechaw.
Those who oppose the statue believe that MacDonald's racist beliefs are a harmful presence in the park and they do not appreciate his legacy.
The Mayor of Regina, Michael Fougere, has stated that he would like the statue to stay, adding that he would be in favour of adding a plaque that would elaborate on the historical context and controversial role Macdonald played in founding the country.
ADs
“He did many good things, but he’s attached to some very unsavoury and nasty things that I think people should know about too,” said Fougere.
The city had previously begun consultations with Indigenous artists and elders earlier in the year but discussions were side tracked by the COVID-19 pandemic preventing group gatherings. The city is now reviewing the the statue once again and the result of that review could lead to the statue being removed.
Regina recently approved the Civic Art & Cultural Collections Policy, which was implemented to provide guidance regarding issues such as city-owned statues or monuments that may have harmful legacies and how to respond.
ADs
In the policy, options such as counter monuments and reinterpretation of the historic figure's significance have been suggested. This could include bringing a modern context to the statue via a plaque or addition. Or potentially, its removal altogether or replacement."

""We've been getting a lot of complaints and request by the public, email after email after email to our EOHU email website, requesting that we implement a mandatory masking in public indoor places, particularly businesses,"" said Dr. Paul Roumeliotis on Tuesday.
Non-medical face masks will be required in all indoor public places within the area around Prescott-Russell to Cornwall, Alexandria and Hawkesbury.
""We will recommend mandatory masking,"" added Dr. Roumeliotis, regarding the EOHU's recommendation in favour of requiring face masks at all indoor public places.
""If I wear a facial covering now, I'm protecting you. If you wear a face covering, you are protecting me. If we all wear it, we're protecting each other—everybody protects each other.""
The details surrounding a mandatory face mask policy are still being sorted out by the Ontario Health Unit and an announcement is expected to come next week, said Dr. Roumeliotis.
However, he did say that public health officials have decided the best way to go about it is to have a ""regional approach"" as opposed to each municipality having their own rules set by each health unit.
People who do not wear face masks indoors will be penalized.
Over the last week, the Eastern Ontario Health Unit has reported two new cases of COVID-19, an area that encompasses the City of Cornwall and the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, Prescott-Russell.
In Toronto, city council also approved a bylaw on Tuesday that would make face masks mandatory in all public spaces beginning on July 7.
Ottawa is also ""seriously"" considering implementing the same regulations, according to Dr. Vera Etches, Ottawa Medical Officer of Health. They will make their announcement on the issue next week as well."

The Post Millennial asked Lewis whether she ""would consider running to be an MP?""
""Oh, absolutely,"" responded Lewis. ""It's just so overwhelming to see that the Conservative message can be delivered, unimpeded by the attacks and the false narratives that are pushed by the Liberals.""
""I've had a lot of leeway to articulate the Conservative message, and people are so refreshed by that,"" continued Lewis. ""I've had people in rural Saskatchewan that are overwhelmingly in support of me; people having my sign on my pick-up truck: the support is just so overwhelming. I don't think I could walk away from this.""
""There's so much more work that needs to be done,"" she concluded.
Despite starting the leadership election with a relatively low-profile, Lewis's campaign has taken off in recent weeks. Lewis was recently endorsed by a prominent social media group. Facebook analytics has also revealed her online engagement to be exceeding initial expectations.
The deadline to choose the next leader of the Conservative Party is August 21. Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, voting will be conducted via mail-in ballots.
Lewis is facing off against two former cabinet ministers in Erin O'Toole and Peter MacKay, alongside the rookie MP Derek Sloan."

Bob Currie, a longtime mayor of Amaranth, Ontario, received a letter from a resident who asked him why he wasn't flying the Pride flag in support of LGBTQ Pride Month the same way their neighbouring municipalities were.
“It is the duty of council to support ALL members of the Amaranth community, and the lack of support does not go unnoticed by your LGBT+ neighbours, friends, and community workers,” wrote Stacey Whittington in a recent letter to the council. She continued, “Refusing to fly the flag sends a very strong, outdated, and harmful message to our LGBT+ community, adults, teens, and children that the township and council does not stand up for them, support them, or support human rights and equity,”
Currie, who is a devout Christian, responded to the letter by saying that, “If everybody was either lesbian or homosexual, this would be the last generation on Earth,” Currie said in response to the letter. “Because two homosexuals cannot produce offspring…two lesbians cannot produce offspring.” Currie added, “So, why would I want to support something when this would be the last generation on Earth? I’m not going to go there.”
Currie, 80, has been mayor of Amaranth for the last 18 years and noted that he hadn't flown a Pride flag in any of those 18 years at the township's mayor.
Stacey Whittington said that she was horrified by Currie's response to her letter, saying she was ""horrified that in 2020, in this township with a large LGBTQ community, that our mayor is saying these things and having them inform his choices as our mayor.”
Susan Walkinshaw, Curries daughter said her father is not homophobic, saying he, “would never do something to offend someone or hurt someone.” Walkinshaw said her father is, “not a politician. He speaks the truth. He speaks his mind.”
The organizer of Orangeville Pride, Jim Waddington, called the mayor's comments ""disgraceful"" and said Currie's “fossil mentality in regards to this type of new world needs to be removed.”
The backlash to Currie's comments has been swift, a petition was launched by Aranmath's to have Currie removed from office. The petition has already garnered over 11,000 signatures.
Currie has refused to step down as of now despite the petition and other public calls for his removal.
“If I hurt somebody, that’s their problem, not mine,” said Currie in response to the backlash over his decision. “But anyways, I did not say, I don’t say what I do say, okay, to offend people.”"

These contracts are given directly to a supplier of the governments choosing instead of being competitively bid on, reports the National Post.
After being criticized for handing another contract off to the organization, Trudeau responded saying that the charity was the only one “capable of networking and organizing and delivering this program on the scale that we needed it…”
The charity has recently been chosen to receive millions from the government in order to run a student volunteer program. The program—worth $900 million—has been outsourced to WE Charity, which will be receiving $19.5 million or more in fees.
Government records show that since March 2017, five federal contracts have been handed over to WE Charity. Together, the contracts are worth $120,000 and the charity has received the majority of them within 15 months—the most recent being far larger than the others.
Nora Loreto, an activist and writer, was the first to point out the specific placing of funds which have been provided for fairly unclear services including, “Public relations services,” “Management consulting” and also, “Other professional services not otherwise specified.”
Trudeau told reporters on Monday that the agreement was not anything out of the ordinary.
“The Government of Canada has extensive practice of working with third parties, charities, to deliver programs. When we wanted to move forward to help various food banks across the country, we worked with the charity Food Banks Canada in order to deliver the program. When we wanted to help grassroots community organizations, we worked with United Way in order to deliver that program,” he said.
The charity received the contract shortly after Craig Kielburger, one of the charity’s co-founders published an opinion piece calling for the Canadian government to bail out charities in a similar manner as they do the private industry.
“More than just keeping organizations afloat, government support conveys social value. What we chose to bailout represents what we believe should survive,” wrote Kielburger.
Federal departments have also provided the charity with contributions and grants reaching close to $5.2 million beginning in 2017.
“What’s really concerning about these sole source contracts is that it’s the oldest game in Ottawa, the nudge-nudge, wink-wink of putting out contracts just below the threshold to have them put out to the public. And those are the contracts that tend to be given to someone who ran your campaign, someone who was involved with you at the party level,” said Charlie Angus, NDP’s ethics critic when speaking to the National Post.
Democracy Watch co-founder Duff Conacher said, “What I find suspect is that the amounts are very large for charities, and the pattern of it suddenly happening after the Liberals are elected, with the spouse of the prime minister being a high-ranking volunteer.”
“That can easily turn merit-based contracting and granting decision-making processes into a ‘who-you-know’ process where the charities that know the prime minister and who are associated with the Prime Minister’s family are the ones that get favoured. It’s illegal, and for good reason,”
“WE (Charity) made a transition from being a grassroots organization to being very, very tied to the Trudeau brand,” Angus said. “Then they go from having no contracts to suddenly getting a series of contracts handed to them. And then they get this $900 million program in the middle of a pandemic, with no history or no credible reason that they would be the obvious choice.”
Conacher plans to file a complaint about the move which will go to the federal ethics commissioner.
“The evidence is clear. It’s an entire waste of money and also a violation of federal ethics law,” he said."

Trudeau defended the choice for a second time, saying that the government has “extensive practice” in cooperating with charities and third parties, according to Global News.
The conflict-of-interest concerns arose because the group has connections with Trudeau and his wife, Sofie.
The $900 million from the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) program will be administered by WE charity. Up to $5,000 will be given to eligible students who do volunteer work for non-profit organizations working to soften the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
An investigation into the choice has been called for by the federal Conservatives who believe that “outsourcing” the program will make it harder for Parliament to monitor it.
Trudeau says that because the organization is a non-profit and his family is not being paid by the group, there isn’t any conflict-of-interest.
“When we wanted to move forward to help various food banks across the country, we worked with the charity Food Banks Canada in order to deliver the program. When we wanted to help grassroots community organizations, we worked with the United Way in order to deliver that program,” he said.
Trudeau noted that the program needed an organization that has the ability to reach a large number of students. He added that since the program opened on June 25—about 25,000 applications have been sent into the government.
“The WE Charities are evaluated by our public service as being the best and only organization able to deliver on the scale that we need to make sure that young people have service opportunities this summer,” he said. “We know that this is something that is going to be extremely important in the coming months.”
The program intends to provide volunteer positions to as many as 20,000 students from now to October. Student grants will be anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 depending on volunteer hours. A student can receive $1,000 for every 100 hours.
After critics said the program appears to be somewhere between paid labour and volunteerism, Trudeau said young people “want to step up.”
“They want to engage in their communities, serve in their communities, help their country and fellow citizens through this difficulty, while at the same time developing important work experience,” he added.
“The idea of giving bonus grants to young people who serve has long existed, and we know it’s something that’s really important to recognize the value of service, but these young people will be volunteering in ways that will make a huge difference right across the country.”
The program falls under the government’s student support package which includes $9 billion in funding for internships and summer job placements. CSSG will receive $912 million from the funding. The amount that will be put towards WE is still unknown.
NDP and Conservative MPs have asked for the Liberals to share the terms of the contract. Trudeau noted that the charity will be paid to run the program but won’t make a profit."

Doug Ford's administration recently launched a task force to make the necessary changes, according to CP24.
While Premier Ford acknowledged that most tow truck drivers were honest people who ""work their backs off"" to provide for their loved ones, he did say that there are a ""small group"" that was tarnishing the reputation of the rest.
“There’s no place for that kind of activity, to all the bad actors out there, my message is very clear, the party’s over, we’re coming for you, we’ll catch you and we’ll lock you up,” said Ford.
The police probes led to uncovering criminal activity that involved one Toronto police officer and included years of arsons, shootings and at least one murder connected to the corrupt industry. The police officer linked to the corruption allegedly provided tow truck drivers with encrypted police radios.
“Tow trucks are an essential piece of the moving economy, of our economy here in Ontario. This task force will ensure that the industry has stronger oversight so that crime does not pay,” said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones.
The task force Ford is launching will include the OPP as well as representatives from all across the provincial government, according to Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney. “Our immediate focus will be making sure tow truck system is clear of criminality,” said Mulroney.
The bulk of the tow truck industry regulations had been previously left up to the individual municipalities however that will change moving forward. The ""first on scene"" policy will also be ended as it encourages tow truck drivers to race to the scene of an accident or breakdown in the hopes of beating out their competition.

The announcement, made today, noted that restrictions would be imposed on Americans because China believes that America “performed badly” on matters concerning the semi-autonomous Chinese territory of Hong Kong.
No details were provided by Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian during a daily briefing announcement. It is still unclear whether the move only targets US government officials or will be imposed on individuals in the private sector too.
Zhao noted that the law was “purely an internal affair of China, and no foreign country has the right to interfere.”
The news comes as a national security law is expected to be passed in Hong Kong on Tuesday which critics believe will largely limit opposition politics in the city along with freedom of speech.
The US plans to respond to the move by putting an end to trading terms made for the former British colony when it fell under Chinese control in 1997.
On Thursday, a bill was unanimously approved by the Senate to impose sanctions on individuals and businesses that undermine the autonomy in Hong Kong or limit freedoms to residents of the city.
“The US side’s attempt to obstruct China from promoting Hong Kong’s national security legislation through the so-called sanctions will never succeed,” Zhao said.
“In response to the above-mentioned wrong behaviour of the U.S. side, China has decided to impose visa restrictions on U.S. personnel who perform badly on Hong Kong related issues.”
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have been advocating for their rights for over a year."

“We’re going to have a discussion with the mayors of the GTHA. It would be better if we could act together,” said Tory.
The City of Toronto has not previously had the authority to mandate mask use said Tory, however they are other jurisdictions in Ontario that have already done that like the Public Health Unit in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph.
“People have come to understand that the best way you can protect other people from the possibility you have the virus and are spreading it through water droplets is wearing a mask,” said Tory in an interview with CP24.
Markham Mayor Frank Scarpittie has asked that the same measure be enacted by York Regional Council, which would require mandatory face masks in all indoor settings.
Tory will speak with the Mayors of the GTA and Hamilton today to try and come up with a collaborative plan moving forward. So far, Doug Ford's provincial government has been encouraging the use of face masks but has not mandated them."

Beginning on July 6, the cameras will start issuing tickets to drivers who are speeding in those areas, there will be at least two cameras per ward and they have been installed on local, collector and arterial roads. The locations for installing the cameras were in selected based on areas that had preexisting problems with speeders.
Tickets will issued automatically at the cameras first detection of speeding, regardless of who is driving.
Signs have already been posted to warn drivers that the cameras are present. Fines will range from small to large fines and will be determined by how much the driver has gone over the limit.
Drivers speeding over the limit by 1-19 KPH will be charged $5 for every kilometre.
Drivers speeding over the limit by 20-29 KPH will be charged $7.50 per kilometre.
Drivers speeding over the limit by 30-49 KPH will be charged  $12 per kilometre.
Any driver speeding over the limit by 49 KPH would automatically receive a ticket for $558 with an additional court costs and a victim surcharge of $130. Should a driver be speeding over the legal limit by 50 KPH they would issued a summons to appear before a Justice of the Peace. Potential demerit points will be applied accordingly as well.
In December of 2019, Ontario gave its municipalities the authority to install and operate speed cameras however for the first 90 days they were only issuing out letters of warning to those captures by the cameras. In just the months of February and March alone, Toronto issued out over 25,000 warning letters.
Initially, proper ticketing was to begin in April however the scheduling was stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ticketing will now begin on July 6 and data on speeding drivers has been logged since January 27. Since it began over 142,000 speeding incidents have been recorded between January and June 18.
The Community Safety Zone that includes FH Miller Junior Public School on Caledonia Road recorded 37,437 speeding incidents alone since the project began.
The worst speeding incident recorded to date was logged outside of Parkdale Collegiate Institute with one driver cruising at 163 KPH in an area that had a maximum speed limit of 40 kilometres per hour."

On Wednesday, court records were presented to a Fort McMurray provincial court judge showing charges of Adam resisting arrest and assaulting a peace officer but were withdrawn by the Crown.
Video evidence of Adam's arrest was captured by the RCMP officer's dashcam and that footage was release to the public earlier this month. The video is 12 minutes long and clearly shows the altercation from beginning to end. At one point Chief Adam can be heard saying, “I’m tired of being harassed by the RCMP.”
There is much back and forth between Chief Adam and the RCMP officer and at one point Adam gets into a fighting stance, taking off his jacket and coming towards the officer. Adam's wife is also present and arguing as well with the officer. At one point the officer puts his arm onto the woman and shouts in pain, prompting Adam to say, ""Hey! Leave my wife alone! You come for me.""
A few minutes later, after some arguing, Adam gets out of the truck’s passenger seat and takes off his jacket as he strides toward the officer. A woman in the driver’s seat gets out and Adam crouches as though bracing for a fight.
Around seven minutes into the three arguing back and forth a second RCMP officer arrives on the scene and swiftly tackles Chief Adam to the ground before landing a harsh punch to his head while the two continue to struggle on the ground. Adam is eventually handcuffed and taken into custody.
The case is currently being investigated by the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team and many politicians and social media users are demanding answers for the RCMP's handling of Adam."

We are spending $40 billion (and counting) to provide basic monthly income via direct payments to Canadians. This effectively means Canadians are not working in their jobs but are getting paid by the government to stay home.
An aspect often forgotten when discussing universal basic income is the importance of the job itself.
The COVID-19 pandemic is the catalyst for this and I fully agree that staying home has been the right thing to do. There will be future debates about government’s actions during this crisis and, more importantly, how we are going to pay for them. There will also be debate about universal basic income with voices touting the pros and cons. One thing is certain: having guaranteed monthly income has caused people to stay home even when they had an option to work.
The late Ronald Reagan famously said: “The best social program is a job”. I realize this statement is overly simplistic since not every person is always capable of working. But the basic premise is still correct for most people, most of the time. Why is that? Why do people need work?
The most obvious purpose of a job is to provide income. But a job provides far more than that. A job teaches work ethic, useful for many aspects of life. A job provides routine, meaning and purpose. A job offers challenges and causes growth. A job provides important social connections along with physical and/or mental exercise.
People who lose their jobs experience grief, uncertainty and self-doubt. Not having a job causes people to feel like they aren’t productive, like they are falling behind their friends and lacking purpose in life. Not having a job can exacerbate mental health problems which can lead to depression, alcohol and drug abuse and even suicide.
The Royal Australasian College of Physicians has done research on the health benefits of work. Their findings are clear; work is good for health and well-being. Professor Sir Mansel Aylward stated, “long-term worklessness is one of the greatest known risks to public health.” Their findings also show that not working negatively impacts the absent worker as well as their families. Children of absent workers will also experience decreased mental and physical health. The increase of self-esteem, purpose, and routine generated from employment have a positive impact on individuals and their families.
Arthur Goldsmith, PhD and Timothy Diette, PhD conducted a study and concluded that long term unemployment has significant impacts on mental health. Their report suggested that public policies should be aimed at programs that reduce short and long-term unemployment and offer mental health supports for individuals experiencing long-term unemployment. It does not take a psychologist to understand the impacts of unemployment on mental health… we are currently living it!
Does a universal basic income lead recipients to work less? Some of the most comprehensive studies were conducted in the 1970s with thousands of participants over a period of years. These studies found that in all cases, participants worked fewer hours when they were given unconditional money. For married couples, men worked 9 percent fewer hours and women 20 percent fewer hours on average. Single moms worked 25 percent less on average.
Even more telling is the Trudeau government’s current experiment. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) has proven to be far more popular than the government anticipated. Businesses in my riding are telling me that it is becoming difficult to convince people to leave the CERB program and return to work. In fact, the Liberals have realized their legislation needs to be fixed. They now want to require people to return to work if they are asked by their employer or face penalties.
The government has acknowledged that some people will not choose to work if a universal income option is available. Long term universal basic income will reduce people’s desire to work. It is also economically expensive and poses risks to the mental and physical health of Canadians. As a result, the government is working hard to encourage people to get off CERB and back to work.
If our goal is to improve quality of life, we must offer programs that encourage people to work. Yes, we need supports like childcare. Yes, we need to help folks who need it. However, taking away the drive to work will create unintended negative consequences.
Government policies should promote long-term employment; not universal income schemes that allow employable individuals to stay at home.
I am not in favour of universal basic income. Businesses and charities are struggling to find workers. Government programs should be matching Canadians with available jobs, not just providing billions in aid.

A law in Canada allows the government to target foreign officials’ personal finances if they are responsible for freezing assets in Canada’s control, violating human rights and forbidding institutions in Canada to participate in business with them.
The group of twelve senators said in a letter that China is “constantly and mercilessly perpetrating horrendous and utterly inhuman acts towards other groups.”
There is also pressure on the Liberal government to take a very different approach, as one senator wants the government to look into freeing Meng Wanzhou—the Chinese CFO of Huawei—from her extradition process.
The idea was rejected by Trudeau who said that her case is to continue without political interference, though the arrest of the Canadians in China is seen as a retaliation to Wanzhou’s situation."

The time period for temporary layoffs has been extended up to six months, according to CTV News.
Employees who were laid off prior to March 31 will have up until December 30th to reacquire their old staff.
“We know that many employers who have had to temporarily lay off employees intend to bring them back to work. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding exactly when that will be possible,” said Labour Minister Filomena Tassi in a statement.
For employees who were laid off between March 31 and September 30, their employer will also have up until December 30 to reinstate them back to work unless their layoff notice had a later recall date.
The extension came into effect on June 22 and applies to the federally-regulated private sector however it will have zero impact on any new layoff that take place after September 30.
An employee would be deemed terminated should their temporary layoff notice have expired prior to their employer bringing them back to work. Employees who had been laid off in March or April as a result of the pandemic would be facing termination soon as they approached the deadline to return to work if not for the new extension.
If a layoff becomes a termination of employment, the employee may become eligible for vacation pay and a severance package which many employers cannot afford to do at this time, nor would they want to if their plan was to reinstate their employee after the pandemic concluded."

On his Twitter account @DrapeauRouge, Jay Watts responded to a Global Times tweet about the Chinese FM defending the detention of the two men.
“Hi, Canadian here: those two were definitely spies, Kovrig's boss even went on Canadian state media the day after his detention and said he was unregistered and meeting with dissident representatives of ethnic populations who had bones to pick with the government of China,” responded Watts.

He followed up the tweet by saying: “I also think the Canadian government will stick to battling via the feeble Canadian media because they know China has actual evidence and it's going to embarrass the shit out of them if they provoke China into releasing it.”
Kovrig and Spavor have now been in interrogation and incarceration facilities for about 560 days. They have been charged with espionage by Chinese authorities which is potentially punishable with life in prison.
The two men have both been charged with spying on national secrets as well as intelligence for non-Chinese entities.
The Communist Party of Canada was founded in 1921 and is the second oldest party that is still active—after the Liberal Party. The party leader is currently Elizabeth Rowley, a politician and political activist.
On its website, the party describes its values saying, “We have a proud, 90 year history of fighting for a socialist future for Canada. We are a small party with big ideas. The Communist Party is a registered Federal political party, and we have successfully campaigned for that democratic right, and pushed forward the legal rules on political parties in Canada.”
“The Communist Party is dedicated to the cause of socialism. As we say in our programme (agreement with which is the basis of membership in the Party) the achievement of socialism, based on working class power in Canada and internationally, will mark a real advance towards true democracy – the rule of the people, by the people and for the people.”"

Bolton’s memoir—The Room Where It Happened—will soon be released and covers the leaders’ interaction during Quebec’s G7 conference in 2018, reports CBC News.
Bolton, who previously held the position of White House national security advisor said Trump did not think highly of Trudeau or Emmanuel Macron—the president of France. The book talks about odd dynamics throughout their meetings.
""Trump didn't really like either Macron or Trudeau,"" Bolton recalls. ""But he tolerated them, mockingly crossing swords with them in meetings, kidding on the straight.
There was a large amount of tension during the G7 meeting as it was during Trump’s move to add broad tariffs to aluminum and steel imports, including imports from Canada and other allied countries.
""I assume they understood what he was doing, and they responded in kind, playing along because it suited their interests not to be in a permanent tiff with the U.S. president.""
The White House belittled the book and so did its allies, calling it inaccurate or exaggerated.
During Boltons insider account of the G7 meeting, he describes that the leaders were having trouble closing out the meeting.
Bolton writes about being called into the meeting by John Kelly who was chief of staff at the time. Many problems began to arise during the meeting and Kelly said, “This is a disaster,” as he walked out of the meeting.
Bolton described that Trudeau and Macron were pushing policy provisions of Trump though he disagreed with them. He says it was evident that Trump had not come to the G7 meeting prepared and did not grasp the issues at hand.
When a deal was eventually reached, Bolton writes, “We were done with the G7, I thought.”
On a flight to Asia at a later time, Trump was on his way to meet with North Korea’s leader and he became furious after hearing that Trudeau complained about the tariffs again during the closing news conference.
Trump then began tweeting about withdrawing his G7 communiqué support. Bolton described the move as unprecedented.
Bolton then spoke with Larry Kudlow, the White House economic advisor, who was set to make an appearance on Sunday television talk shows.
""Trump's direction [to Kudlow] was clear: Just go after Trudeau. Don't knock the others. Trudeau's a 'behind your back guy,'"" writes Bolton.
He says Trump wanted Kudlow to attack Trudeau with the help of White House aide Peter Navarro, who on TV said Trudeau had a “special place in hell” for his actions against Trump.
Tensions have been up and down between the leaders ever since the meeting.
The tariffs were eventually removed for Canada and Mexico. Kudlow also noted that he and Trudeau became more friendly with each other since the 2018 G20 meeting."

Singh was kicked out after he would not agree to apologize to Alain Therrien, the Bloc Quebecois House Leader, after calling him racist. Singh made the comments after Therrien denied the approval necessary for a motion against systemic racism in connection with the RCMP.
Singh was looking to pass a motion requesting that the House recognize systemic racism in the RCMP and he was seeking unanimous consent. The motion also involved looking into the RCMP budget, federal law governing the police force and other accountability measures.
“I don't back down from standing up to racism… I don't think it benefits me to call people names, I was angry at the moment and I stand by it,” noted Singh during a press conference following the sitting which was held to look over recent federal spending measures.
“In that moment I got angry, but I am sad now, because why can’t we act? Why can’t we do something to save peoples’ lives? We can do something, and why would someone say no to that?”
The other parties seemed to be on board with the motion but the Bloc Quebecois rejected the motion with an audible “no.”
A verbal confrontation between Singh and Therrien then began and Claude Debellefeuille then asked for the House of Commons Speaker to call for order. She added that Singh used unparliamentary language to insult her colleague.
Singh then said in French, “It’s true, I called him a racist.”
He was then removed from the sitting by the House Speaker after refusing to apologize.
“In this moment where Indigenous people are being killed and being brutalized, Black people are being killed and brutalized in Canada. We've not seen any action,” Singh said when speaking to reporters.
“And in that moment, we put forward this motion, but I thought given where we are, given what's going on, given the lack of action, here is something we can do concretely to actually make a difference… Kind of shocked that anyone would say no to this motion.”
DeBellefeuille requested an apology from Singh for the second time in a statement adding that the Bloc Quebecois are for looking into discrimination and racism in the RCMP but did not want to come to conclusions too soon. She added that Therrien’s reputation was tarnished by Singh’s insult."

“This is not a fully exhaustive list,” the Budget Office wrote on Wednesday. McKenna in a March 10 report to Parliament said “over 52,000 projects have been announced government-wide with contributions of approximately $57.5 billion. Almost all of these projects are either started or completed.”
At that time, Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux had said that he had faith the projects existed, but that there needed to be more transparency around their existence, according to Blacklock's Reporter.
Giroux said at the time that in 20,000 cases, records of those projects having started are nowhere to be found. ""We’ve asked the department and have been able to find information for 33,000 of these projects,"" Giroux said. ""We have not been able to see a list that includes all these 52,000 or 53,000 projects, only 33,000 of these projects.""
On January 29, The House of Commons gave the green light to a Conservative Party motion that would mandate a federal audit of billions in the federal budget for public works. One budget officer says that he has attempted for months to gain access to a full list, but that only a ""partial list"" was given.
""We are in active and ongoing negotiations with Infrastructure Canada and multiple departments and agencies to try to compile a list,"" said Jacques. ""I would say it has taken potentially a little bit longer than we anticipated.""
""How many billions are missing from the list?"" asked Shadow Finance Minister Pierre Poilievre. ""It’s about half of the program,"" said Jacques.
Dates missing since February 12
The PBO said it has been requesting a completed list of the projects since February 12. Over 30,000 projects have been compiled, with 12,297 being itemized on June 5, leaving more than 7,000 projects yet to be verified.
""Inconsistent data in this report refers to missing project level funding, exclusion of program level funding, and incomplete project data which refers but is not limited to missing location, start dates, end dates and projected funding,"" wrote analysts."

The recommendations also include the possibility of a new provincial police force, according to the Edmonton Sun.
“Albertans understand that equalization is fundamentally unfair. Albertans are proud to contribute to their fellow Canadians when times are good here but bad elsewhere,” said Kenney on Wednesday.
The Fair Deal Panel made a total of 25 recommendations that the province has tabled in the legislative assembly, among them is also the idea of pulling out of the Canada Pension Plan.
Kenney said that that the energy sector and Alberta in particular has been hit with bad policies imposed by Ottawa, saying that most Albertans understand that equalization is ""fundamentally unfair.""
“The report and recommendations of the Fair Deal Panel are not a cry for help, they’re a demand for fairness. Failure to get a fair deal for Alberta is not an option,” said Kenney.
A referendum on equalization was part of Kenney's 2019 election campaign however the panel's report stated that a referendum in Alberta would be non-binding. Any changes would have to be approved by the House of Commons, the Senate, and the majority of the provincial legislative assemblies. There would also be other consequences as a result as well, both legal and political.
“What Albertans cannot and will not accept is governments across the country benefiting from that wealth and our resources while seeking to block and impair our development of that wealth and those resources by killing pipelines, by opposing them through policies that hammer our largest industry,” said Kenney.
Independent polling was conducted throughout the province regarding the ideas and Kenney claims that the support for them is ""significant."" Their finance department is looking into the costs and benefits of having their own Alberta Pension Plan.
The report showed that the contribution rate would be much lower if Alberta were to create their own pension plan. Currently, they pay 9.9 percent but that could be dropped to 5.85 percent if they had their own, which would save the province $3 billion annually that they have to contribute to the Canada Pension Plan.
Alberta also spends $262.4 million on RCMP service every year and the federal government pays $112.4 million. The report says that the province or municipalities would have to make up for the federal money however they believe that Albertan communities would benefit in the long run from having their own provincial police force. Under that system they could launch their own initiatives to fight crime and not have to always wait for approval from Ottawa.
“The panel also wishes to make clear its conviction — a conviction we believe a majority of Albertans share — that the best option is to achieve a fairer deal for Albertans, and for all Canadians, within Confederation,” read the report which also warned against the province using separation from Canada as a negotiation strategy, calling it unconstructive."

Stuart Green, a TTC spokesperson, said it will take until July 2 before they can implement the mask rule because their agency will require some time to roll out its educational campaign regarding the new policy.
The TTC also plans to provide one million non-reusable masks to residents on a one-time basis to make sure everyone has access to the face masks. Distribution of the face masks will be prioritized marginalized communities first."

The request comes from the Parliamentary Black Caucus in a statement. The group was formed in 2015 and is a mixture of senators and members of Parliament from different political parties.
The statement comes after many protests against police brutality and racism throughout North America following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.
The Parliamentary Black Caucus is proposing measures to reduce ""pernicious and widespread phenomenon"" after saying that non-blacks are just learning about the amount of racism in Canada now.
""The members of the Parliamentary Black Caucus are heartened to see so many of their fellow citizens taking to the streets to peacefully express their desire for Canadian society to stamp out racism,"" wrote the group.
""However, to rid our society of racism will require concrete actions by all levels of government to begin to make a difference.""
One of the groups priorities is improving race-based data that is collected and also eliminating bias and discrimination in the police force as well as the justice system.
The group calls for more support from the government in businesses run by black Canadians, more investments in black arts and culture and an increase in black representation in public service.
""While Canada is a great country, for many black Canadians it has yet to achieve its full potential,"" the group said. ""For more than 400 years, black Canadians contributed to what all Canadians enjoy today, in spite of the legal, social and economic barriers.
""In order for Canada to fully realize its potential, we must work to eradicate the consequences of systemic discrimination faced by black Canadians.""
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to the calls during his daily appearance.
""We are committed to moving forward on a huge range of measures. We're working with communities, we're working with leaders like members of the Parliamentary Black Caucus to identify what exactly we need to move forward on first ... "" he said.
""I think it's really important that we all come forward and look at bold ideas that we can take on very soon to fix the systemic discrimination that continues to exist in our country.""
He says his government has already been working on much of what the Parliamentary Black Caucus is calling for.
""We will be moving forward on a number of those recommendations,"" Trudeau said."

""Ontarians should think of their circles as the people they can touch, hug and come into close contact as we continue our shared fight against COVID-19,"" wrote Health Minister Christine Elliott in a statement regarding new government recommendations.
""Not only will social circles help to improve people's mental health and reduce social isolation, they will support rapid case and contact tracing by limiting the number of close contacts, in the event of a case of COVID-19 in that circle,"" said Dr. Williams.

According to the Ontario government's website, people who wish to form a safe social circle should follow these five simple steps:
Start with your current circle: the people you live with or who regularly come into your household;
If your current circle is under 10 people, you can add members to your circle, including those from another household, family members or friends;
Get agreement from everyone that they will join the circle;
Keep your social circle safe. Maintain physical distancing with anyone outside of your circle; and
Be true to your circle. No one should be part of more than one circle.
The good news has prompted many social media users to post photos of themselves reuniting with their families and loved ones.

Mike Layton, a Toronto city councillor posted a photo of his daughter and her grandmother reuniting for the first time in three months.
Television host Tracy Moore posted pictures of herself and her parents reuniting, writing, ""Breaking news: WE CAN HUG. In Ontario the social bubble has been expanded to ten people and that meant an immediate visit to squeeze the living crap outta these two. Nothing can replace the smell of your childhood home and the folks who brought you into this world,""

People have been posting videos of the first time they are getting to hug their loved ones since the pandemic first began in March.

The elderly have been the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and were unable to see their kids and grandkids over much of the last three months. As the social distancing regulations begin to loosen, they are now taking advantage of the opportunity to be together.

""At the outset of the pandemic, we had to make the necessary, but difficult decision to ban large public gatherings and strongly advise physical distancing with everyone except immediate household members"" said Premier Doug Ford.
""As the public health trends improve and our collective efforts start to pay off, we're now able to take another step forward today by allowing families and their loved ones to reunite and spend time with one another safely through social circles."""

The sitting Liberal Member of Parliament was released following an online bail hearing and the news was kept quiet, according to the National Post.
Tabbara posted a Facebook message from jail:
“Thank you, Frontline workers and your families in Kitchener. We are thinking of you and thank you for keeping us healthy,” said the post which included a video of Kitchener police officers and paramedics driving past a hospital in honour of essential medical workers.
“We learned about this issue — the arrest, the charges, everything that had happened — on Friday,” Trudeau said, after the news was published by National Post and other sources on June 5—about two months after the incident.
“Everyone in a leadership role carries a responsibility for transparency and to be open and honest, otherwise it becomes difficult to create a sense of trust and safety,” said chief executive officer of the Women’s Crisis Services of Waterloo Region, Jennifer Hutton.
“For too long violence against women has been viewed as a personal and private matter rather than a public one. Everyone has a role to play in ending violence against women,” she said. “Community leaders are held to a higher account and there is a need for authenticity because they are in a position of trust and power.”
Guelph police said they did not release the information because Tabbara was not seen as a threat to the public.
Police said in a written statement that they do not release every incident to the media and Tabbara’s arrest was “not brought to the attention of the media office.”
Tabbara was released and had to pay $1,000 if he breached any conditions of his release. The Speaker’s Office reported that the rule is generally not followed.
“This practice is no longer scrupulously and/or consistently followed,” said Heather Bradley, a spokesperson for the Speaker’s Office. “Parliamentary authorities note that the failure to inform the Speaker or the House has not been viewed as a matter of privilege.”
Mark Holland, who runs caucus management did not know about the arrest, according to his chief of staff, Charles-Eric Lepine.
“The whip has the responsibility to ensure that caucus members are provided with the proper support,” Lepine said. “As such, members have the responsibility to inform the whip of any serious situation which they may have been involved.”
Tabbara has just resigned from his position as chair of the House of Commons subcommittee on international human rights."

An additional $1.1 million will have to be paid for operations, according to CBC.
""The mission of a government is to manage a limited budget in order to address needs that are, for their part, unlimited,"" wrote Supreme Court Chief Justice Richard Wagner. ""This is not a pressing and substantial objective that can justify an infringement of rights and freedoms. Treating this role as such an objective would lead society down a slippery slope and would risk watering down the scope of the charter.""
The 7-2 decision was based on the Supreme Court's ruling that the B.C. government had violated section S. 23 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees education in one of Canada's two official languages in their approach to funding.
The case first came to be after numerous parents and the Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique school board accused the B.C. government of systematically underfunding the French-language schools and therefore denying their charter rights.
Suzana Straus, a resident of Richmond, B.C., and president of the Fédération des parents francophones de Colombie-Britannique, said that for her son to get to a French school, it takes over an hour. ""It means, for many families, they will choose not to send their children to francophone schools,"" said Straus. ""They will choose to go to the local school, and that means assimilation. And that saddens me tremendously.""
""We now hope that the provincial governments will step up further in areas that are their exclusive jurisdictions, like education,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was happy with the Supreme Court ruling. Trudeau called it good news for minority-language communities across Canada who have felt for decades that the other provinces aren't providing the necessary access to such services. ""As a federal government, we will always stand ready to support and help minority-language communities across this country.""
The provincial government of B.C. released a statement confirming that it respects the decision of the Supreme Court and their guidance on minority-language education rights. They are asking for some time so they may review the decision and outline what steps need to be taken next to remedy the issue.
""We will continue to work with the francophone community in B.C. to ensure minority-language education rights are respected,"" read part of the statement."

The arrest took place on March 10, outside a casino in Fort McMurray in Alberta, according to CBC.
The dashcam recording is nearly 12 minutes long and shows Adam getting agitated with one RCMP officer who has pulled up behind his truck in the parking lot.
""F--king leave us alone!"" shouted Adam to the RCMP officer, within moments after he pulled up behind him. The RCMP officer's vehicle had its lights flashing. ""Don't f--king stop behind us like you're f--king watching us."" continued Adam. Later, Adam turns to the officer and asks him to tell his sergeant that, ""Chief Adam f--king tells you, 'I'm tired of being harassed by the RCMP.'""
While Adam is yelling at him the officer is still in his vehicle and continuously asks Adam to go back inside his vehicle until he gets out to come talk to him.
""You and I are going to have a f--king problem, right here, right f--king now,"" responds Adam, who is getting increasingly angry. He then walks around behind his truck, takes his jacket off, and then assumes a stance as if he is preparing to fight the officer.
While this is happening Adam's wife can be seen trying to calm him down and frequently getting in between the two of them. At one point the officer grabs Adam's wife and appears to attempt to make an arrest and Adam starts yelling at him not to touch his wife.
The altercation goes on for about seven minutes before the officer tries make n arrest of Adam by grabbing his left arm. At the same time, another officer runs into the frame and tackles Adam to the ground. Once on the ground, the second officer punches Adam in the head while he struggles to get out from under the two officers. The second officer then puts Adam in a chokehold.
""F--k you, don't resist arrest!"" the officer yells at Adam, ""Don't resist! Don't resist!"" As the officers lead Adam away, his face is visibly bloody.
Const. Simon Seguin presented his notes and the video in an affidavit filed in court. ""I charged at the male [Adam] with the intention of bringing him to the ground,"" Seguin wrote in his notes. ""I struck the male as he tried to come up,"" Seguin later wrote. ""He turned on his right side. I struck him using my right hand on his right side of the face.
""I wrapped my hand [left arm] around his jaw and started squeezing."" Seguin continued, ""I then wound up placing my left knee on the back of the male's head and 'cranked' the male's left arm up."" Following that action, ""The male [Adam] was complaining of police brutality.""
On Thursday, Adam's lawyer Brian Beresh, presented the video into the public court file as part of a motion hoping to have Adam's charges stayed. RCMP argued that the video should not be released because its evidence in the criminal case against Adam.
The RCMP had rejected Beresh's call to publicly release it. The RCMP said they could not release it because it is evidence in the criminal case against Adam. Beresh said in an interview that no senior RCMP officer could view the video and still believe that the officers acted appropriately.
""This was a false arrest; there was no basis for it, and it was excessive force used,"" said Beresh. ""We reject that totally. We will let the public look at the video and make a determination.""
Beresh claims that Adam's behaviour before the arrest was ""a reaction to the systemic racism that his people have suffered for a long time, and that is a part of what agitated him."" Beresh continued, ""He, as the leader, feels that he has to stand up and make the statement,""
""If you're bothering me as the leader, what is happening to those people that have no voice?""
Adam said blood was pouring from his mouth and and that he had to fight to maintain consciousness while the officer continued to strike his back.
""Every time our people do wrong … [the RCMP] always seem to use excessive force and that has to stop,"" said Adam to reporters. ""Enough is enough.""
Adam said that if he weren't a member of a minority group, then he wouldn't have been subjected to the violence. Adam called the incident part of a broader pattern across Canada of police harassing minorities.
The video of the incident as well as the photo of Adam's battered face have brought much attention to the issue of police brutality in Canada.
Adam has been charged by the RCMP with one count of resisting arrest and one count of assaulting a peace officer. Adam is scheduled to appear in court on July 2.
Senior RCMP officers reviewed the dashcam footage and determined that the officers' actions during the arrest were reasonable ""and did not meet the threshold for an external investigation.""
However Alberta's director of law enforcement has since asked the Alberta Serious Incident Response team to conduct their own investigation as criminal allegations have been made by Adam and his lawyer towards the arresting officers.
""We have obviously all seen and been deeply alarmed by the pictures that Chief Adam shared,"" said Prime Minister Trudeau on Monday. Trudeau said he vows to bring forth ""significant, concrete and rapid measures"" to address systemic racism in Canada's policing.
Alberta's commanding officer of the RCMP has publicly denied that there is systemic racism in Canada's policing. Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zabocki also said he didn't believe the issue was systemic in Canada during a news conference in Edmonton, however he later said, ""We all acknowledge that racist individuals can be anywhere throughout our society and institutions — and we have acknowledged that organizationally in the RCMP."""

This would effectively double the budget for the program
Those who were among the first wave of CERB recipients will come to the end of their four-month period of distributions in early July.
The government will be repaid 50 cents of each dollar earned over $1,000 and allow recipients to continuing getting the benefit for another 3 months as it stands now, according to the parliamentary budget officer. By expanding the CERB program through to January of 2021, it would cost an additional $57.9 billion, estimates a report by budget officer, Yves Giroux's.
The report doesn't factor in the money already spent on the CERB program by the federal government, which currently sits at $60 billion, up from it's initial $35 billion as more and more Canadians apply for the benefit and many Canadians are staying on it longer than expected.
As of June 4, the program has paid out $43.51 billion to the 8.41 million people who have applied for it.
Giroux believes the extension of the program may be enough for some people to not want to go back to work as businesses begin to reopen and restrictions are loosened.
Applicants are not to continue receiving the benefit if their employer has asked them to return to work and they are able to do so. Many small business owners are in favour of cutting off CERB payments to workers who are offered their jobs back, with the exception of health-related issues, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says.
Dan Kelly, president of CFIB said that whatever the final decision should be from the Liberals regarding CERB, they should do it sooner than later to allow for some certainty for companies as they reopen.
""While it's too early to do away with CERB, it's time to shift gears on the federal support programs to encourage people to rejoin the labour force,"" said Kelly in a statement.
Statistics Canada recorded that in May three million people remained unemployed which brought the unemployment rate to 13.7 percent, an all-time high. Men began returning to work at a faster pace than women, which has widened the gender gap regarding job losses."

The petition was created on Tuesday by Andrew Lochhead, a Toronto resident and has already garnered more than 3,800 signatures.
“I really started this with the intention of starting a conversation and hopefully spurring some action towards understanding a little bit of our heritage that is so ubiquitous around us,” said Lochhead. “A lot of people have said to me that we didn’t understand or know the history of Dundas Street and so it doesn’t mean anything, it is just a street name. But to that I say if it doesn’t mean anything than why not change it to something that can be meaningful to us today.”
A series of protests have been going on across Canada and across the United States in the wake of George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer.
Dundas Street is named after Henry Dundas, a Scottish politician, who's legacy some are calling ""highly problematic"" as he participated in obstructing the abolition of slavery up until the end of his career in 1806.
City council has said that they will take “a constructive and symbolic step towards disavowing its historic associations with persons who have actively worked toward preserving systems of racial inequality and exploitation” in light of the protests.
In recent weeks, many statues have been removed both by a city council vote or by angry protestors and certain streets renamed due to those public figures historical connection to the slave trade. One confederate monument that honoured a Confederate navel officer was taken without notice. In Edinburgh, a statue of Henry Dundas has been the subject of much debate and was defiled with graffiti over the weekend.
Mary Ann Shadd was Canada's first black newspaper publisher and Lucie Blackburn, who created Toronto's first taxi company (after escaping slavery in the U.S.) have both been suggested as possible namesake's for the renaming of Dundas Street, according to Lochhead.
“One of the key parts of this petition is that I really think renaming Dundas needs to be a consultative process that involves not only Black-led organizations and historical societies but indigenous groups and others,” said Lochhead. “All manner of public consultation I think is important in this.”
Mayor John Tory said that he was unaware of how Dundas Street was named until reading about it in the petition and he assumes most Torontonians wouldn't know either.
“In light of all the concerns that exist about racism and a number of other things that fit into that sort of historical basket, what we should do is find a way to go about looking at all these different names and statures in a thoughtful way, perhaps based on some expert advice from a historian for example as opposed to Facebook petitions,” said Tory. “Facebook petitions are terrific but they are not the way you make public policy decisions or decisions like this.”
Upper Canada Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe, was close friends with Dundas and responsible for naming both the street and the town of Dundas after him."

Some of us have found these changes easier to handle than others. For example, I have worked from home for over five years. I'm used to living alone. I'm a good virtual communicator. I don't have to deal with young children who need my constant attention.
On the other hand, I'm very bad at following orders. Suggestions, good ideas, yes. Orders? Not so much.
I have to admit that I fear for our future. Not because of the disease itself. But because of the way we have responded to it and the way we continue to respond.
We have to acknowledge that at first we had no idea what to expect from this infection. Was it like the flu? Was it like the Spanish flu? The bubonic plague?
We received contradictory and confusing advice from our political and medical ""experts"": isolate, don't isolate. Wear a mask, don't wear one. Advil, no Advil. Hydroxychloriquine, no hydroxychloriquine. Gloves, no gloves. Visit the cottage, don't visit the cottage.  Etc etc etc
When we finally settled on a ""strategy"", we picked one that crippled our economy, raised unemployment to near depression levels, and put government debt at all time highs.
And then there is the media. Oh. The media. The fearmongering, negativity and bad information still flows like waste through the sewers, adding to the anxiety and fear already out there.
Pro tip to you political and media geniuses out there: people want and need certainty, hope and clarity. They don't need articles that promote fear nor do they need it want ""road maps"" that aren't specific. If your GPS said, yep, I'm taking you to Timbuktu, but I can't tell you how or when you'll get there... Well, you get the picture.
What worries me about our future? A number of things.
The utter lack of political leadership, with very few exceptions.
2. Our unpreparedness for this or any other national emergency.
3. A generation of snowflakes who would actually allow the government to lock them down because they have been convinced by these same ""experts"" that only a vaccine can fix this problem. When we realize that in fact there are NO VACCINES for HIV, H1N1, the common cold and the flu vaccines are hit and miss as any epidemiologist will tell you, this notion becomes not only nonsensical but dangerous and crazy.
4. An irresponsible and lazy media that doesn't fact check and disseminates uncritically anything that is handed to them and requires no real work.
5. The political beings who see this as an opportunity to move forward their ""progressive"" agenda, including universal basic income, gun control, and other centralizing strategies that take away personal liberty.
It is very important that Canadians take a deep breath and look at the facts, the numbers and the actual results of this strategy.
The numbers of COVID-19 positive test results continue to rise. Of course the reason for that is that the amount of testing is increasing dramatically. Most of these people are asymptomatic, some get mild symptoms, some get fairly sick, and some get seriously ill, and even die. I suspect if you took my blood today, you'd find one of the coronaviruses lurking in my body. But my immune system, which I inherited from my Russian Jewish family, is strong and able to fight off infections.
The deaths among the elderly in long term care and retirement homes are not surprising. This is common every year as a result of whichever strains of flu are flying around. But our ""experts"" apparently saw no reason to isolate the elderly in these living situations from each other and from people coming in and out of their nursing homes, unless they could be verified as COVID-19 free.
In fact, in New York, the much lauded Governor Cuomo may have caused the death of hundreds in nursing homes by insisting that infected people be allowed back into these unprepared living situations. Lives might have been saved, if the approach that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis used in Florida had been followed.
The deaths among people with underlying health conditions, such as heart and lung disease, diabetes, MS, and the like are also not a surprise. They should have been cautioned to self isolate and try to keep away from people who might be ill. That makes sense.
Children don't seem to get this disease in the same way that they seem to avoid serious cases of the flu. Why we closed the schools escapes me. Test the teachers daily. Let the kids stay in school with masks and gloves.
All the businesses that were shut down could be opened with some caution and rules. Social distancing, masks, gloves, and testing or taking temperatures. This would have made life able to be somewhat normal, far less disruptive and may have promoted herd immunity, not to mention saved some businesses.
And, anyone who doesn't want to work or send their kids to school, fine. Stay home. That's your right.
But the liberty and freedom of the rest of us cannot be sacrificed ""for the greater good"". As we chip away at our rights, and become accustomed to bowing to the barking dogs who howl every time someone raises an objection or even expresses reservations about a policy decision, we make return to normalcy less and less likely.
I spoke to my friend this week who proudly told me that he's delivered groceries to his mom and his dad and they waved from a distance. I asked him if they had been isolated and not seen anyone for several weeks. He said yes. I asked if they were sick. He said no. I asked if his family at his house had been isolated. He said yes. So then I asked why they could not have a family bubble and see his parents and let his kids see their grandparents. He had no answer. None at all. Hadn't thought about it.
Then there's the issue about the effects of isolation on people. Loneliness, lack of physical contact in many cases, depression, increased domestic violence and strife. Not to mention the toll that has been taken on people with chronic illnesses who cannot get treatment. People who live with chronic pain are a great example. They're not looked at as critical or urgent. But take it from someone who lived with pain for 18 months preceding hip replacement surgery, chronic pain is not only debilitating, it's depressing.
So what's the solution?
It is important that our leaders understand that there is no ""new normal"". That we expect them to have our lives back to us, and that we will accept nothing less.
We need to examine our response to this panic, yes panic, and think about whether the response was proportional.
We need to demand that our officials, elected and otherwise, keep in mind that unlike them, we don't have a guaranteed continued income. Many lives have been disrupted, some even destroyed through no fault of their own, but because of rash decisions made by politicians and bureaucrats who worried more about covering their asses and avoiding blame than doing what was right for the people they serve.
Hindsight may be 20-20 but it is important that we learn lessons from this public policy disaster. No one is infallible. No one is an absolute expert. We cannot be lemmings, marching into the sea behind our ""experts"".
We have the absolute right to question and demand answers without fear of being pilloried as killers of old people or Nazis or shit disturbers.
Personally I plan to continue to hold the decision makers to account, both those I love and support and those I don't love our support. I'm going to judge them on their actions, not their politics. I'm putting politics aside and looking at results.
You should too."

According to Guelph police, the Liberal MP received charges of break and enter, assault and criminal harassment.
Tabbara has a court appearance scheduled on June 19.
Tabbara was elected to office for the southern portion of Kitchener and the Hespeler area of Cambridge in 2015.
A spokesperson for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office said, “We are looking into the matter.”
This is a breaking story and will be updated."

The $88 million that will be spent on communications and marketing this year is in addition the the government's current budget for communicating with Canadians on other various issues. The extra spending for COVID-19 related messaging amounts to more than the annual budget for all other public issues combined over the last 10 years.
The Privy Council Office is responsible for helping the Prime Minister's Office to co-ordinate government departments and the Trudeau plans to increase their budget by 39 percent by 2021, giving the Privy Council and additional $58.3 million, of that $48.7 million will go to communications and marketing.
Canadian tax payers will be footing the bill in order to receive these messages about the government's response to the pandemic and that is only part of the bill.
Stephane Shank, a spokesperson for the Privy Council said that $10 million of the new money will be put towards an existing Public Health Agency of Canada campaign, that has already spent $30 million so far. The Finance department will receive another $12 million in addition to its campaign budget of $1o million so it make continue ""promoting economic supports for businesses and individuals.""
The $26.7 million that is left over will go to top up the Privy Council's budget for the purposes of spending it on ""other advertising departmental initiatives related to COVID-19 as necessary.""
The spending is designed to ensure that Canadians will receive information regarding their health and safety and lay ways that they may clearly access government programs, according to Shank.
""These efforts have and will continue to provide critical information to Canadians throughout the pandemic in four key areas: public health information, financial support for individuals, financial support for business and the economy and public safety and security information including travel advice,"" wrote Shank.
The latest spending on communications is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of money that is being thrown on the fire of the pandemic to keep Canadians and business afloat during this period. However the concept of government spending on on advertising has long since been a controversial one. When Stephen Harper's government decided to spend on advertising for its ""economic action plan,"" the decision was swiftly criticized by both the NDP and Liberals, Justin Trudeau among them.
As for spending on COVID-19 public messages, critics say that money would be better spent being put directly in the pockets of Canadians who are suffering the most from the pandemic.
""When we're talking about marketing at a time of pandemic, every single dollar that the federal government has available needs to go to support families and seniors, small business people, students. People who are struggling to get through this pandemic,"" said Peter Julian, the NDP House Leader.
""For tens of millions of dollars to go to marketing at this critical time, it just defies belief. It shows that the government's priorities are not in the right place. They really need to make sure that those resources are invested to support Canadians.""
Tim Uppal, a Conservative Treasury Board Critic argues that the amount of money is far too much considering the budget that the Privy Council previously had. ""So now, we have additional funds that are on top of all the other departments that are also spending money on communications and marketing,"" said Uppal. ""It's starting to look like this government is very concerned about their communications and marketing plan.""
The other frustrations faced by Julian and Uppal is that the money isn't being given directly to the various departments, such as the Public Health Agency of Canada or Health Canada but is instead being given to the Privy Council to be delegated from there.
""I don't think anyone would have difficulty if they were increasing the budget for the Public Health Agency,"" said Julian.
""The Privy Council Office has traditionally been the political support for the prime minister and as a result of that, it's doubling disturbing that at a time when so many people are struggling and so many people are looking for resources just to get them through the month that the federal government and Mr. Trudeau are choosing to spend tens of millions of dollars on marketing."""

Rosenstien made the statements while testifying before the Judiciary Committee which has GOP members looking into the Russia investigation of the 2016 election along with the Trump Campaign, reports NBC.
Rosenstein said he appointed Mueller to the Russia investigation after Jeff Sessions recused himself due to concerns that, “the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI director was not the right person to lead it.”
“I decided that appointing a special counsel was the best way to complete the investigation appropriately and promote public confidence in its conclusions,"" Rosenstein said. ""As we now know, the eventual conclusions were that Russians committed crimes seeking to influence the election and Americans did not conspire with them.""
Andrew McCabe was the acting FBI director at that time and Rosenstein said he was “not fully candid” and “certainly wasn’t forthcoming,” when it came to the Russian probe.
McCabe gave a response in a statement saying that Rosenstein’s “claims to have been misled by me, or anyone from the FBI, regarding our concerns about President Trump and the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia are completely false. Mr. Rosenstein approved of, and suggested ways to enhance, our investigation of the President. Further, I personally briefed Mr. Rosenstein on Jim Comey’s memos describing his interactions with the President mere days after Mr. Rosenstein wrote the memo firing Jim Comey.""
Rosenstein defended his singing of the FISA applications in his testimony as well.
“Every application that I approved appeared to be justified based on the facts it alleged, and the FBI was supposed to be following protocols to ensure that every fact was verified,” Rosenstein said to lawmakers.
He then acknowledged findings from March and last December’s investigative reviews, which he said “revealed that the FBI was not following the written protocols, and that 'significant errors' appeared in applications filed in connection with the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.”
Rosenstein said he would not have approved the FISA warrant application if he knew what he knows now.
Rosenstein noted that he agreed the FISA warrant applications 17 errors did not undermine the Russia investigation. He agreed that the FBI errors also did not undermine assessments that the 2016 election was interfered with by Russia.
Roseman said the Department of Justice “must take remedial action” when prosecutors and agents “make serious mistakes or engage in misconduct.”
“While it is necessary to correct mistakes and punish wrongdoers, it should not go unsaid today that our law enforcement agencies are filled with men and women who act with integrity,” Rosenstein said. “As we watch them deal with extraordinarily difficult challenges throughout the country, we should take this opportunity to let them know that they have our appreciation and support.”"

On Tuesday, the proposed bylaw that would have required cannabis growers to control the odour of their plants was voted down.
""People are going to have to get used to the smell of cannabis. The same way we got used to the smell of asphalt and traffic and cars and stuff,"" said West Nipissing councillor Jeremy Seguin. ""It's going to stink at first and some people may not adjust to it very quickly.""
Seguin referred to the bylaw as a ""preemptive attack"" targeted at ""demonizing"" the smell of cannabis, warning that should it be passed that it would only result in legal challenges which ""could be very expensive"" for the municipality.
The idea for the bylaw was first proposed by Councillor Lise Senecal two weeks earlier. ""You cannot tell people 'Well, deal with it.' Because that's not the way it's working,"" she explained to council, saying the rights of everyone must be respected.
Senecal believed that the bylaw was in the same vein as littering or noise regulations. She said the bylaw would help to ""avoid major confrontation in a neighbourhood."" Senecal cited a a recent trip to a Sturgeon Falls neighbourhood where she said that the odour was strong enough to give her a ""buzz,"" a comment she would later regret.
""I really got bashed on that [comment] and I want to apologize,"" reflected Senecal on Tuesday. ""It was an expression to express how strong the smell was that night.""
The Mayor of West Nipissing, Joanne Savage was in favour of Senecal's proposal although she would have given municipal bylaw officers ""some type of leverage,"" treating each complaint individually regarding cannabis odour. ""And if it's never applied, it's never applied,"" said Savage.
In the last year, West Nipissing municipality received four complaints regarding the smell of cannabis.
""I regret this has caused pain and anguish to certain citizens of our community and therefore cannot and will not support this bylaw,"" said Councillor Dan Roveda, who said he felt misled by how the issue was first presented two weeks ago.
Some councilors noted interest in how the provincial or federal government might regulate the situation."

“Thinking of my brother today. It would have been his 51st birthday. He was committed to serving the people of Toronto. There will never be another politician like him. I can’t wait to see you dancing again brother. Happy Birthday Rob,” the post reads.
From 2010 to 2014, Rob Ford served as the 64th Mayor of Toronto while Doug was the Toronto City Councillor for Ward 2 Etobicoke North.
The two were born in Etobicoke, Ontario. Doug was the second of four children and Rob was the youngest.
Rob’s political career had its fair share of controversies, and he struggled with alcohol and drug addiction which was heavily reported in the media.
Rob revealed on October 28, 2015 that he had an abdominal tumour and announced the next day that it was cancerous.
A “get well soon” website was created by the Ford family so that positive messages could be sent to Rob while he was receiving cancer treatment. The website saw over 5,000 messages wishing Rob well in the first two weeks. It was later confirmed that Rob was placed in palliative care at Mount Sinai Hospital on March 21, 2016.
Sadly, he passed away on March 22, 2016 at the age of 46."

We're giving you permission to break the emergency glass on the following, treat them more like guidelines, and do what works best for your finances. Here are some pieces of financial advice that haven't aged well during the crisis.
The rule: 'Save 10% of your income'

Life changes and so will your saving patterns. Sometimes you’ll be able to save more and sometimes you’ll have to save less — and that’s OK.
If your income stream is more sporadic thanks to the pandemic don't stress over not meeting your savings goals.
If you can afford to set some cash aside, consider a high-interest savings account. Unlike a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) which locks down your money for a certain period of time, you can access your funds with less hassle.
High-interest savings accounts are quoting rates as high as 2.80% which is more than some GIC’s are offering. Remember to ask about how long an amazing rate lasts for (sometimes they are for a limited time), minimum and maximum deposits and withdrawal rules, if any.
The rule: 'You don’t need life insurance if you’re under 35'

Many people seem to be obsessing over whether they'll be able to travel again — instead of planning for the unthinkable with a life insurance policy. But the current pandemic serves up sobering reminder that anything can happen.
So, if you have debt, loans or a mortgage, you should definitely consider purchasing a life insurance policy — even if you're under 35.
A small policy that covers the cost of your collective debt and your funeral will leave your family with the gift of a zero balance.
Per $100,000 worth of coverage, policies can be as low as $10 per month for a healthy and non-smoking 30-year-old. That's like getting a streaming subscription.
You can get started with a service like PolicyMe which makes buying life insurance policies within your budget easier than finding a hotel. You'll be able to get side-by-side quote comparisons in minutes.
The rule: 'You need to pay off your mortgage right away'

Your grandparents and parents stress that you need to pay off your mortgage ASAP. That's probably because they have a financial hangover from sky-high mortgage rates during the '80s — which catapulted to 21%.
Today’s interest rates can be as low as 2.10% (10 times lower than the '80s) and you're able to compare a pool of lenders side-by-side to find the best rate.
While you’re setting up or refinancing your mortgage (which is worth exploring while rates are sensationally low), leave yourself with enough monthly cash flow to invest. Through a diligent investment strategy you may be able to generate returns higher than your mortgage interest and have more money to fall back on.
By redirecting some money that would’ve gone to a big and expensive mortgage payment, you have more cash to work with when investing.
You might then want to contribute your money to a tax-sheltered account like a RRSP or TFSA and invest in high return stocks and bonds — on your own or with the help of a financial planner.
If you're not a confident investor, it's OK to sit back and let a robo-advisor do the work. Robo-advisors have growth portfolio options for those looking to boost their earnings, and you're able to easily open an RRSP or TFSA investment account for tax-sheltered gains.
The rule: 'Ditch things you love from your budget'

Saving doesn’t mean forgoing the things that spark joy in your life. It’s better to plan for the odd breakfast sandwich, or dinner at a nice restaurant, instead of feeling guilty over reasonable splurges.
Finding money to save is about cutting out mindless spending first. Start by evaluating automated subscriptions or bills siphoning money from your account every month.
Instead of subscribing to every single streaming service out there, focus on one or two that have the most programs that you're interested in. If you have a car, your insurer might be offering lower or refunded premiums for coverage during the crisis.
Consider downgrading data coverage on your mobile phone — since you're mostly using WiFi during lockdown.
Get rid of paid personal training programs, there are plenty of free online workouts, resources and classes accessible from the comfort of your home.
The rule: 'Never carry a credit card balance'

Debt is a scary word and some struggle to get a handle on it, or avoid it at all costs. It's possible to reach this state of debt-free nirvana if you have a steady job but COVID-19 has taught us that your cash flow can get zapped overnight.
When you don’t have the money to pay for essentials like groceries and transportation, trust that your credit cards are there to tide you over until you get back to work.
There’s no shame in having debt when you need to bridge your finances. The thing you'll want to do immediately, though? Lower your interest rates.
You may want to transfer your debt to a card with an active balance transfer promotion. Balance tranfser promotions often offer low-to-zero interest rates for a limited period of time, typically the first six months to one year.
And once you're able to get back to work, you might want blast through your debt with a low-interest debt consolidation loan that'll allow you to focus on a much smaller monthly payment.
Before you start leaning too much into credit cards though, register with a free online service like Borrowell that offers credit monitoring. Monthly reports will give you a glimpse of your credit score so you’ll know when you’re pushing your limit and affecting your score.
Ultimately, an excellent credit rating is something you’ll need long after this current crisis is over."

The Montreal-based circus will be given a loan of $200 million USD to keep the franchise alive, according to the Montreal Gazette.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic The Cirque had to lay off almost its entire staff, almost 4,700 people and cancel all upcoming 44 international shows.
Should the circus' current owner decide to sell the company the deal includes an option that would give the Quebec government a chance to buy it so that it would remain under Quebec ownership.
The Quebec government has no intention of actually running the business however, pointed out Fitzgibbon.
“The Cirque has a need for financial aid to allow it to be relaunched,” said Fitzgibbon. “The current shareholders have a plan to relaunch the Cirque and they came to see us. We said, ‘Yes, we’re going to help you but here are the conditions.’ … The most important thing is we are relaunching the Cirque with Quebecers in positions of power, with the intellectual property here. … The Cirque is too important for Quebec to let it be bought by a foreign company that will then move the head office out of Quebec.”
Cirque du Soleil is currently majority controlled by the American investment firm TPG Captial.
TPG Capital, China’s Fosun Capital Group, and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec are the three main shareholders. Recently they gave the Cirque $50 million to keep it in business amid the pandemic.
The provincial government's financial arm, Investissement Québec has made an agreement in principle with the three main shareholders to help provide additional aid.
The Cirque du Soleil's founder Guy Laliberte has also expressed interest in the company as well as Quebecor but for now the government will side with the current shareholders.
“The government can’t offer a blank cheque to the billionaires who presently own the Cirque or to those who want to acquire it. The government should take a more active role that will allow it to be at the table to take part in decisions for the future and not just be a spectator watching the sale of this Québécois jewel.” said Vincent Marissal, an economy expert for Quebec Solidaire.
Gabriel Dubé-Dupuis, who worked as a creative director for the Cirque du Soleil said, “It makes us very happy to see that there are viable options being presented and that there’s interest in the survival of the Cirque du Soleil,” Dube-Dupuis also acts as a spokesperson for a group of Quebec artists that are currently owed money by the company and he's advocating that the government make one condition of their loan be that they pay out the over $1 million that us owed to various artists that have worked for them.
“But in the meantime, we haven’t been paid. This is money we need to put food on the table.” said Dube-Dupuis.
A statement released by the Current Cirque management read, “The strong interest shown by the consortium formed by Investissement Québec and our current shareholders is further evidence of the strength of our brand and the importance of preserving the Québec heritage of Cirque du Soleil.”
Fitzgibbon said the current Cirque debt is over $ 1 billion USD and that should be one main priority with regards to the provincial loan, saying, “And we agreed on a level of debt that’s much lower than that. … The Cirque will continue to pay its taxes in Quebec and in Canada and also the salaries of the top executives will be reasonable as is the case in all of the situations where the government is involved. In terms of the non-financial conditions, the head office and the decision-making centre will have to be in Quebec, and the intellectual property will stay in Quebec. And the top executives will be Quebec residents.”"
0,2020-05-22T16:50:49.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/ndp-looking-for-federal-subsidy,NDP applies for Trudeau government's federal wage subsidy as donations drop-off,"The New Democratic Party is now one of the organizations looking for a federal wage subsidy amid the pandemic.
An application is being submitted by the party on Friday to the Canada emergency wage subsidy program as it looks for support to cover salaries while donations begin to wither, according to CBC News.
There are 17 full-time staff employed with the NDP along with 15 to 20 part-time workers who take care of fundraising, administrative functions, bookkeeping and running digital platforms for the party.
""We think it's really important to stay active and functioning. To do that includes paying the bills and paying our workers,"" said Anne McGrath, the NDP national director.
The party is trying not to furlough employees which will add more stress to the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB) and is instead looking for the wage subsidy in order to allow experienced employees to remain on the payroll.
The wage support program was made to allow non-profit organizations and companies to refrain from laying off workers in the current economic situation.
A 75 percent wage subsidy will be offered by the federal government to entities that have seen considerable revenue losses due to the pandemic.
""That's what the program is there for. It's there for organizations who have staff and it's to prevent layoffs and that's what we're doing. I think it's the responsible thing to do and I want to protect the jobs,"" noted McGrath.
Around $2.5 million in benefits and salaries was booked by the NDP in 2018—the year with the most up to date data available.
In recent years, the NDP has had difficulty raising funds.
McGrath said that after a short period of increased donations following the last election the party saw a considerable drop-off around the time Canadians began feeling economic difficulties linked to the pandemic.
McGrath also said that funds for March and April are below what they were during the same time period last year.
About $400,000 was raised by the party in May 2019 and it is estimating that the party will see approximately $280,000 this year.
""The good news is that the monthly donors have stayed strong and those few who have had to cancel their monthly donation for financial reasons have pledged to come back when things change,"" she said.
There has been no recent in person fundraising by the party due to physical distancing measures."
0,2020-05-22T11:58:18.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-black-voters-new-interview,"WATCH: Joe Biden says black voters who don't vote for him ""ain't black""","Joe Biden is taking some heat after making a controversial statement on the popular morning radio show The Breakfast Club in an interview with host Charlamagne Tha God, according to CBS News.
While Charlamagne Tha God was arguing that Biden's campaign wasn't doing enough to reach out to garner the approval of black voters, Biden responded by saying that black voters who can't decide between voting for him or President Trump than they, ""ain't black.""
Charlamange asked Biden about what his thoughts were on comments from rapper Diddy (Sean Combs), who said that Democrats that black voters for granted, Biden cited his win in the South Carolina primary, where he won by a landslide.
""I kicked everybody's — excuse me,"" said Biden said, cutting himself short before swearing
""I need you to say that!"" replied host Charlamagne.
""I won every single county. I won the largest share of the black vote that anybody had, including Barack,"" continued Biden, then taking a moment to acknowledge that Delaware has the eight highest population of black people in the country, which is is home state. ""They're the folks that, as they say up my way, brung me to the dance. That's how I get elected every single time.""
When pressed about his support for the 1994 bill which implemented stronger penalties for minor drug offences which led to mass incarceration, predominantly affecting poor black communities the most.
""The crime bill didn't increase mass incarceration, other things increased mass incarceration,"" retorted Biden citing that in 1994, the Congressional Black Caucus also supported the bill.
Biden mentioned the ""three strikes"" rules and their mandatory sentences as something he opposed when President Clinton chose to support it. Biden also suggested that ""no one should go to jail"" for a drug crime, ""particularly marijuana,"" adding that he is favour of providing treatment over incarceration.
""No one should be going to jail for a drug crime. Period,"" said Biden. Charlamagne asked why then he chose to support the decriminalizing marijuana rather than jsut outright legalizing it. Biden replied by citing the ongoing studies that are researching the long-term effects of cannabis use on the brain. ""I know a lot of weed smokers,"" said Biden.
Biden also said that he could ""guarantee"" that he was considering choosing a black woman to serve as his vice president, although he is also looking at possibly choosing Amy Klobuchar, a white woman, for the spot as well. ""I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple,"" said Biden.
One of Biden's staff interrupted their interview to say that the vice president was out of time.
""You can't do that to black media!"" said Charlamagne.
""I do that to white media and black media,"" said Biden, promising to visit Charlamagne in New York and appear on ""The Breakfast Club"" in the future to answer additional questions.
""If you have a problem figuring out if you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black,"" said Biden.
""It don't have nothing to do with Trump—it has to do with the fact that I want something for my community,"" replied Charlamagne. Biden responded by saying that he should take a look at his voting record, which would reveal his longtime support for the black community."
0,2020-05-21T13:13:48.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/andrew-cuomo-other-governors-blame-trump-for-their-nursing-home-failures,Cuomo and other governors blame Trump for their own deadly nursing home failures,"The number of deaths from coronavirus in nursing homes and long-term care facilities among older populations has far exceeded the numbers of either infections or deaths within the public at large. The elderly have experienced the burden of this illness more than any other segment, yet governors are still laying the blame for their state’s failure of the aging than taking on that responsibility themselves.
New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo, who in late March issued a directive stating that elderly persons who were released from the hospital after recovering from the coronavirus should be returned to nursing homes for further rehabilitation, does not take the blame for nursing home deaths upon himself, but blames Donald Trump.
This came as congressional Republicans floated the idea of launching a federal probe into New York's coronavirus nursing home crisis. Cuomo says he was only following federal guidelines for his state's response. ""It's because the state followed President Trump's CDC guidance, so they should ask President Trump,"" Cuomo said. ""I think I think that will stop the conversation."" The death toll in New York is nearing 30,000, while there have been over 3,000 nursing home fatalities from the illness, at time of writing.
Cuomo's earlier missive regarding the transfer of patients recovering from coronavirus back to nursing homes stems from this guidance issued by the CDC in March. ""A nursing home can accept a resident diagnosed with COVID-19 and still under Transmission- Based Precautions for COVID-19 as long as the facility can follow CDC guidance for Transmission-Based Precautions. If a nursing home cannot, it must wait until these precautions are discontinued."" This differs from Cuomo's guidance.
Pennsylvania’s Governor Tom Wolfe, whose health secretary Rachel Levine cares more about being misgendered than answering for the excessive fatalities among nursing home residents in that state, has overseen an infection rate of which over 50 percent are in old folks homes. Of 68,151 total cases in Pennsylvania, and 4,822 deaths, 2,786 were in nursing homes, at the time of writing.
Michigan’s Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who has seen substantial pushback against the lockdown restrictions she imposed on that state, also issued a mid-April executive order stating the state's nursing homes should accept coronavirus patients. This jeopardized other residents in those home, and contributed to the high rate of fatalities in that state, about one-third of which were in Michigan’s nursing homes.
Florida’s Governor DeSantis cut off Florida’s nursing homes from visitors in mid-March, without shutting down the rest of the state. In fact, pretty much everyone made fun of Florida for allowing spring breakers to keep partying on Daytona Beach and other Floridian fun spots. But now that state is considering reopening nursing homes, and they have not seen a massive toll on their senior population. This despite the fact that Florida has an aging population and is a top destination for American retirees seeking warm climes. Desantis has had strong words for other localities.
Gov. DeSantis explodes on the media for their unfair coverage of his state’s handling of coronavirus.

Nursing home deaths in the US account for one third of the total number of deaths. Governor’s that have engaged in lockdowns and enforced quarantines and business closures for all of their residents have sorely neglected their nursing home populations. If these numbers had been looked at sooner, and the reality been made known that it was this vulnerable population that would be most affected by the disease, perhaps both the death count at nursing homes could have been lower, and the horrifying deleterious impacts of these insane economic closures could have been prevented."

The poll showed that 72 percent of Canadians support postponing elections while the coronavirus pandemic is still underway.
Of the men surveyed, 60 percent said they are strongly against the elections being delayed compared to just 33 percent of women.
Saskatchewan and Manitoba showed the least support for delaying elections at 59 percent in favour.
The poll shows that the two provinces that have the most support for continuing their elections on time also have the least recorded satisfaction with premiers.
Saskatchewan is currently set to move forward with its election by October 2020.
Scott Moe, the premier of Saskatchewan, said that the election will go forward on October 26 no matter what is happening with the coronavirus curve.
At a press conference held last week, Moe noted that the election is ""likely to look a lot different than the last election looked like four and a half years ago.""
""I have every confidence our chief electoral officer will ensure that we are able to conduct that election in a very safe manner across this province,"" he added.
Canada has only once delayed an election, and that was a postponement of more than five years and was on account of the First World War.
Ipsos CEO Darrell Bricker says the move to delay would not be a surprising one.
""(People) really want their politicians, all public agencies, everyone in the country focused on this problem of dealing with this terrible virus and the disease that it creates,"" Bricker said.
""Politicking as normal is not seen as an appropriate thing at this time.""
Lisa Young, a professor of political science at the University of Calgary said the relevance of the data is ""really a question of how long we’re going to be living under these circumstances.""
""Depending on how long the pandemic lasts, there is going to be a necessity to think about how we can hold elections in ways that don’t put people at risk,"" she added.
Young said that provinces only need to have elections every five years. She described delaying the date as ""perfectly reasonable"" though waiting over five years would present ""significant"" political impacts.
""Any time you essentially set aside the Constitution in order to delay holding an election, you raise the question of whether you are taking away people’s fundamental political rights,"" said Young.
""I would assume under most circumstances that a government that did this would be punished when an election was eventually held because they had taken away citizens' right to vote.""
University of Waterloo political science professor, Dr. Bessma Momani said waiting too long to hold an election may have serious consequences.
""The democratic vote is an essential part of grading the government's actions, behaviours and policies,"" she said. ""If you don’t have that mechanism, governments will not feel that they have a responsibility in the same way.""
She touched on the way politicians' campaigns could be changed by the pandemic.
""How governments try to make this as inclusive as possible will often be explained by whether or not they would be successful at the polls,"" Momani said.
She said that postponing the elections would be in a government's best interest if they have an older voting base full of people who are less likely to show up to the poll. But a government like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's, that does well with the younger generation, might decide to create policies that allow for voting online or mail-in.
Momani also spoke about what she calls the ""urban versus rural"" debate which could affect the way politicians move forward with the campaign trail.
""Highly dense urban areas maybe feel less comfortable (lining up for the polls), particularly because we know the virus thrives in dense situations, while rural communities may feel more comfortable because they have less cases,"" she said."

In the video, Poilievre says that it's the duty of the official Opposition to ensure that the sitting government serve Canadians, and that while large corporations are indeed hurting, the measures announced today by Trudeau could come back to harm Canadians down the road.
Below are the four reasons the government got today's announcement wrong, in Poilievre's view.
1. The rich could getting richer from it
""The proposal does not ban executives from paying themselves bonuses or paying dividents, or share buybacks to their shareholders,"" explains Poilievre. ""These corporations could use your money to bolster the profits and payouts to wealthy shareholders instead of to protect our workers, and jobs.""
2. Job losses could still run rampant
""There are no guarantees that jobs will be maintained. In other words corporations get to stuff money in their pockets, and lay off workers at the same time,"" said Poilievre. ""I thought the whole purpose of the bailout was to save jobs, even so, why is there no guarantee in this policy?""
3. The announcement ignores Canada's dying oil industry
""After blocking pipelines for over four years, the Trudeau government has nearly killed our energy sector. There's nothing in today's announcement that would reverse or even mitigate that damage,"" said Poilievre.
Additionally, Trudeau's announcement today made clear that oil and gas companies would be expected to put forward a frame that shows their commitments to reducing emissions and fighting climate change to be eligible for the LEEFF. Companies which avail themselves to the LEEFF subsidies will need to make a commitment to the fight against climate change.
""We have seen many oil and gas companies make commitments already around net-zero by 2050, around understanding that we need to do better in terms of reducing emissions both as a country and as a sector. That's why we're expecting them to put forward a frame within which they will demonstrate their commitments to reducing emissions and fighting climate change,"" said Trudeau of the funding.
4. Political bias in funding
""The money will be handed out by politicians who make the final decision on who gets what,"" explained the Carlton MP. ""We don't want any politically motivated slush funds to help friends of the government. We don't want it to go to the company that has the best lobbyists."""
0,2020-05-07T10:09:50.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/fords-approval-rating-reaches-74,Ontario Premier Doug Ford's approval rating skyrockets to 74%,"Doug Ford became Ontario’s premier in 2018 and received comparisons to Trump due to his combative nature. Kathleen Wynne even said that like Trump, Ford believed in an “ugly vicious brand of politics that traffics in smears lies.” She also said he would “say anything about anyone at any time.”
In February, one pollster noted that Ford’s approval rating was down to 31 percent—mostly due to conflicts with teachers’ unions. Now, just a short time later, Ford’s approval rating has reached 74 percent.
As the coronavirus outbreak made its way to Canada, politicians were forced to temporarily drop some of their tasks and make fighting the pandemic a priority. So far, Ontarians seem to be happy with Ford’s handling of the situation.
Michelle McQuigge, a political commentator wrote that Ford “has been turning heads since it became clear that Canada would not be spared the spread of the novel coronavirus.” She made the comment on March 29 just under two weeks after a state of emergency was declared by Ford. “But many of those heads, once likely to be thrown back in dismay, are now bestowing nods of approval.”
Ford has received praise for his ability to leave some of his politics at the door when it comes to fighting the virus. He has been listening to advice from public health officials and giving straightforward and seemingly empathetic press briefings.
Ford has now announced an economic reopening for many Ontario businesses beginning on May 8."

Premier Doug Ford admitted that he's been facing increasing pressure to reopen the province's economy in light of the most recent COVID-19 data that suggests the spread of infections has likely already hit its peak.
""The first priority is making sure we protect the health and well-being of the people of Ontario,"" said Ford on Friday.
The Premier said his administration plans to take a ""gradual and measured"" approach to jump start its economy, citing Saskatchewan as a model for reopening.
“Saskatchewan has a much, much smaller population and large area,” said Ford. ""But we always look at other models right across the province—actually, we look at models right around the world, to see what’s working, what’s not working, and take the best ideas of them.”
Just which areas of Ontario will be opened first is still unknown, but both Ford and Finance Minister Rod Phillips have said that the rollout of re-opening non-essential businesses will likely be what dictates the movement of residents.
While the lockdown measures remain in place, Ontario is providing small business owners and landlords with financial relief as they struggle to survive throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ontario has committed to $241 million dollars so far, in partnership with the federal government through the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (OCECRA) to provide financial aid to those who need it most.
The provincial-federal relief fund will bring a total of $900 million dollars to the people who have been most affected by this pandemic.
Prime Minister Trudeau announced that the federal government and each of the provinces and territories have reached an agreement to implement rent assistance to businesses, as promised. Based on the agreement, rent will be reduced by as much as 75 percent for any small businesses that are eligible, so long as their landlords agree to take part.
“We are doing everything we can to support them through these tough economic times, so they can hit the ground running when we are in a position to open up the provincial economy,” said Ford."

“With places like libraries and community centres closed due to COVID-19, we know our homeless residents are having trouble finding a safe place to go during the day while adhering to directives for social distancing,” said City of Windsor Community Development & Health Services Commissioner Jelena Payne. “By partnering with some great agencies, we’re able to provide a safe, clean location and personal supports to help everyone get through this pandemic.”
The Canadian Mental Health Association, Family Services Windsor-Essex Street Outreach Team and the CommUnity Partnership will all be on site to provide support.
The day program at Windsor Water World will run every day from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., offering activities and light refreshments in accordance with the proper social distancing measures."

The ban on public events was already in place, however it has since been extended to August 31 which means the Calgary Stampede and Canada Day celebrations will fall under the new timeline and those gatherings will be cancelled.
Bylaw officers will be on patrol throughout the city's parks and public gathering areas to issue tickets to people not meeting the proper physical distancing measures. These require people to remain at least two metres away from one another at all times.
Provincial health orders dictate that no more than a maximum of 15 people can be grouped together at one time. The fine for not following these protocols starts at $1,200 and can be raised to $100,000 in court, even for a first offence.
Calgary police have already issued nine tickets to people not adhering to the new measures and many warnings have been given out from bylaw officers.
Traffic along Crescent Road NW will also be restricted by authorities to prevent people from travelling to the popular lookout over Calgary's downtown.
Foot traffic will remain allowed on the McHugh Bluff stairs, however only for people to go up, to travel down people are required to use the ramp nearby."

The federal government revealed the most recent numbers Friday morning and found that $22.4 billion has been paid out so far from the $2,000 per month package, according to CP24.
Applications for the CERB relief were made available just over a month ago and since then there have been 7.12 million unique applicants to date. The program has an overall budget of $24 billion.
The CERB was implemented by the Trudeau government as one of several different programs to help Canadians deal with the economic hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Four of the programs that they have implemented have been met with criticism recently by Parliament's budget watchdog, Yves Giroux.
Yves Giroux said that a $25 billion dollar loan program for businesses will result in expenses to federal coffers of more than $9.1 billion dollars through different costs of interest, defaults and loan forgiveness.
The Trudeau government has additionally created the Canada Emergency Business Account which will offer interest-free loans for as much as $40,000 to help businesses cover their costs of operation. Up to $10,000 dollars of that loan will be forgiven if repaid before the end of 2022."

In May, the new contract will be put to a vote of ratification, according to the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation.
Public relations between the Ford administration and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF) had been contentious for some time, dating back to September of 2019. Province-wide strikes had been held numerous times between December and February by all four of the publicly funded school boards. It was a growing tension that was only thrown off track by the COVID-19 pandemic in March which resulted in all four schools boards being closed down in order to implement social distancing.
Upon the closure, schools were scheduled to reopen on May 4, however that date has since been extended by Premier Doug Ford. The new return date has yet to be determined.
Harvey Bishof, President of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation said they were well aware that their negotiations would have to take a back seat to these, ""extraordinary times.""
Bishof noted the impact of COVID-19 on their negotiations and new contract during a video conference. “While this tentative agreement does not satisfy all of our concerns, we recognize the current environment we are in and the need for students to have stability once this emergency is over,” said Bischof.
The union said it was able to halt the provincial government on some of their more ""egregious proposals,"" such as bringing in mandatory e-learning and increased class sizes.
Ford's government backed down on their push to have the student-to-teacher ratio increased from 23:1 to 28:1 and dropped the mandatory e-learning requirements from four obligatory courses down to two. Parents also have the option to meet with their student's guidance counselor should they want their child to opt out of the online classes.
The government did manage to get the union to agree with their compensation request of one percent per year for the life of the contract. Through legislation, the Ontario government was able to impose this contract onto employees of the public sector.
All four education sector unions plan to challenge Bill 124 in court however, also known as the Protecting a Sustainable Public Sector for Future Generations Act, on the grounds that it's unconstitutional.
Education Minister Stephen Lecce stressed that their government has always been trying to reach a deal that will be beneficial for the priorities of the students and their parents, in a statement he released on Monday.
“During this entire process, our aim was to ensure our young people receive the best education we can offer, so they can develop the skills they need to succeed in the classroom and in the jobs of the future,” reads the statement.
“We will remain focused on the government’s dual priority of keeping students safe while ensuring the continuity of education. Moreover, we remain determined to continuously strengthen teacher-led learning and virtual learning for the benefit of our students, and we continue to look to our educators to rise to the challenge and deliver quality education to every child, wherever they may live.”"
0,2020-04-18T13:22:40.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/otoole-how-to-reopen-canada,O’TOOLE: How to reopen Canada,"Canadians have been doing their part to protect our country and our fellow Canadians from COVID-19 for several weeks. The growth rate of infections is dropping, and we may be seeing light at the end of the tunnel.
What Canadians need to know—now—is what their government’s plan is to get the country reopened. We are beginning to see governments in Europe ease some of their restrictions, and in the United States, President Trump released a plan yesterday to allow counties and states with lower levels of infection to begin phasing their reopening over the coming months.
We may be waiting at least 18 months for a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Canadians cannot spend 18 months locked in their homes. This isn’t just about economics—though that would bankrupt families, communities, provinces and the country. The harm that an extended lockdown would cause to the health and wellbeing of Canadians is massive. Everyday I hear from Canadians about those struggling with their mental health in isolation.
Once the initial wave has passed, we need to find ways to let people resume some kind of a more normal life until we have a vaccine. It won’t be business as usual. There will still need to be precautions, and we will need to remain vigilant, ready to reimpose preventive measures quickly if we detect a second wave. Employers will have to keep up social distancing measures in the workplace and ensure adequate supply of masks, gloves and PPE for workers.
I have been talking with businesses, large and small, about how they are using this downtime to plan for the post-COVID-19 era. Many of them are already making plans for how they will safely resume their business operations, and they are wondering why Canada hasn’t made a plan too.
It is becoming clear that a plan needs to include the following:
An aggressive system of mass rapid testing for all those with symptoms and their recent contacts, and approve innovative technologies quickly to test for previous exposure and immunity.
Domestically sourcing and producing the masks, PPE and medicines needed to prevent shortages.
While safeguarding the data privacy of Canadians, deploy technology to rapidly identify those who have been in contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 and a system for ensuring that they quarantine until they are tested and cleared.
Procedures for screening and mandatory quarantining of all those who arrive in Canada.
Distribute masks in places where crowding is hard to avoid like transit and require people to wear them.
Industry-specific health and safety rules that allow businesses to reopen in ways that minimize risks.
Community-specific plans to allow regions where there are very low or no rates of infection to reopen faster while limiting movement to keep those communities virus-free.
Continue to promote working from home where possible, but allow a phased reopening of industries that can implement health and safety protocols and limit gatherings of people.
A gradual easing of rules and guidelines to allow people to physically distance without being socially isolated. This could start, for example, by reopening parks and walking trails, and allowing a slow increase in gathering sizes over time.
We must protect our veterans, the elderly, and vulnerable people in care homes without cutting them off from family and community. Communication technology can be deployed to care homes to help maintain physical distancing without socially isolating vulnerable people.
Canadians need to know that our government has a plan. They are struggling—both economically and increasingly also physically and mentally—from the shutdown. Knowing that our government has a plan to get them back—to work, to seeing family and friends, to living their lives—is crucial.
Canada’s businesses, of all sizes, are taking a lead in making their plans to reopen while keeping workers and customers safe. Canada needs to show leadership nationally so Canadians can plan for their futures and know there is much to look forward to after we get through this together.

We look to our leaders to give us instructions on what to do to not get sick, to not spread disease, and to allay our fears and anxiety. But as those leaders enact measures and guidelines to protect us, our rights are being sacrificed. Once government takes control, it is slow to hand it back, if it ever does.
Tech firms have released cell phone tracking data across the US and Canada, and it is being used to help figure out where the next hot spots will be. This is a process called ""contact tracing."" But the emergence of this data can certainly lead to problems for privacy down the road. And it will be hard to fight our rights back if we don’t track the egregious offences against them now.
It’s easy to say that we need to take any and all measures to contain and prevent further coronavirus spread. After all, people are dying—the US just breached 2,000 deaths in one day, the largest recorded single day death count of any nation since the virus began its global rampage. Estimates of when we can open the country and our economy back up vary wildly from a few more weeks to fall 2021.
If these crisis conditions are in fact the new normal, we can’t allow the temporary loss of our basic civil rights to metastasize into a permanent condition.
Yet, if we don’t hold our elected leaders to account now, that’s exactly what will come to pass. All of our resources, energy, and precautions are brought to bear on eradicating the COVID-19 coronavirus from our population and public spaces. As we advocate for that and support these efforts, determining for ourselves that the best course of action is to do whatever we can personally, be it wearing masks, staying indoors, we must also advocate for the return of civil liberties.
While Nevada’s Governor Stephen Sisolak is rejoicing in that state’s ranking among social-distancers, Indiana’s Governor Eric Holcomb is demanding the closure of churches, regardless of the social-distancing measures implemented by the faithful.
Kentucky’s Governor Andy Beshear promises to record license plates of those attending worship services, and then to fine them for being out of their homes for non-essential reasons. It’s telling to see how much our right to freedom of religion matters to our elected officials when they so easily deem that freedom a “non-essential.”
Dr. Anthony Fauci, who we see daily on coronavirus briefings, has indicated that perhaps it would be sensible for those who have been cleared of the virus to carry papers so that they can be identified as allowed to travel beyond their front yards.
Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Wolf has prohibited the sale of alcohol, due to their arcane ""state store"" system. In Philadelphia, police physically removed a man from a bus for not wearing a face mask.
And across the board, there is the feeling of a tendril creep of authoritarian tendencies being exhibited by our elected leaders who would certainly find their jobs easier if the population was more controlled.
Across these many states, citizens are experiencing this pandemic differently. New York and the northeast are in their own miasma of pain, metropolitan pockets in populous states are bracing for the onslaught of this virus. While small towns and communities are feeling locked down almost for the hell of it. And while Americans have a vast store of patience, that could begin to wear thin. Once that happens, no measures but the most extreme will keep them in their panicked place.
The conversation about how to prevent and contain coronavirus spread is important, but it’s not the only one that needs to be had. We need to save lives, we need to secure health and safety. But we also need to make sure that the world we emerge back into, rubbing our sleepy eyes and squinting at the sun, still holds our individual rights and freedoms as critical and foundational elements of public and private life. We need leaders who are aware of that fact, and who hold our personal sovereignty more dear than they hold their own power."

Scheer asked the prime minister to organize another emergency sitting in the House of Commons, which he thinks is ""necessary to fix the gaps in your original legislation which were caused by rushing through legislation during the last emergency sitting.""
Scheer blamed these gaps on the Trudeau government ""circumventing"" parliment: ""when there is no debate, no discussion ... it makes it that much harder to perfect legislation.""
""Now is the time for basic parliamentary oversight and increased transparency measures,"" added Scheer.
The Trudeau government was previously criticized for attempting to overhaul parliament in its emergency legislation that was introduced a few weeks ago. This, however, was shot down, after opposition parties (excluding the Bloc Quebecois) vented their frustration.
Trudeau's Liberals are governing on a thin majority after their election victory in 2019. As a result of this, it is especially difficult for the government to pass legislation through the House of Commons.
Despite this, Scheer's Conservatives have said they would support Trudeau's emergency legislation, so long as it does not alter the foundations of Canadian democracy such as parliamentary sovereignty."

Already, some MPs have made an appeal to the Correctional Service of Canada so to stop the prospect of pandemic parole. Some calls were made for prisoners to be released after two inmates in Quebec tested positive for the virus.
As soon as this was reported, the Canadian Bar Association urged the Trudeau government to consider releasing ""those who can be safely released.”
This caused some anxiety to communities who have prisons within their boundaries, with MPs saying that residents were upset by the potential of law-breakers getting out early and staying in halfway houses.
Conservative MP Damien Kurek said that ""there’s just a great level of uncertainty at a time when anxiety is at an all-time high across our country.""
Another cause of concern, is that police officers would have to divert their much-needed resources to monitoring and controlling these newly-released prisoners.
""I’ve heard from numerous constituents who have great concern,"" added Kurek. ""They are concerned about the impact that will have on services the municipality provides to its residents, and the way it will affect what is a growing disparity of services for those who are in great need if they want to release offenders.""
Justin Trudeau's cabinet has said that they are still reviewing the pandemic-policy of releasing prisoners early. They have not yet come to a conclusion."

Owens, the host of “The Candace Owens Show” on PragerU, made the announcement on Twitter. “I’m now honestly considering running for office,” tweeted Owens. “Never had any desire to previously, but something changed in me last night.”
Her tweet said that she spoke with her husband, George Farmer, about running for office, and they agreed it was a plan.
The tweet was posted before Owens appeared on “The Glenn Beck Program” on Blaze Radio. She confirmed that she intends on running for office on that show.
She said that she wants to run for office because she has become frustrated with certain governors and how dishonest they have been during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
“Watching the way these governors are lying and mismanaging, I’m getting sick of it,” she said. “I said to my husband that I think I should get into politics.”
The office she will be running for will be a surprise announcement. While she did not specify if it will be in 2020 and who she will be facing, she claimed that she is eyeing a seat.
She speculated that it might be in Connecticut or New York. She grew up in Connecticut, and she spent her early twenties living in New York. She said that she has not spoken with her mentor, American President Donald Trump, about running for this office.
“I’ll win the entire thing,” she said. “And they won’t know what hit them.”
Owens and her manager, Gina Florio, could not be reached for comment in time for publication."

TPM: Some journalists are concerned about how civil rights are being affected due to broader government reach into our lives due to the pandemic, from everything from free speech, free assembly, freedom to bear arms. How do you think Americans will be able to get their civil rights back after the pandemic passes?
MR: Like most people, I want to do the right thing during this time of crisis to help keep my fellow Americans safe...but it’s also impossible not to notice the immediate power grab the Left went for here. The minute our backs were against the wall and we were at our neediest, the Democrats saw it as a green light to start stripping away at our constitutional rights while simultaneously using the opportunity to push forward their leftist ideals and socialist platform. If they think Americans didn’t notice, or that we weren’t going to demand our rights back the minute this is over...then they’re in for a very rude awakening.
TPM: CNN and other media outlets have used their platforms to block President With CNN broadcasting Trump's press conference on a delay rather than live. What does this say about the future for the press in the US?
MR: It couldn’t be any clearer that our media is biased against conservatives and manipulative in general. You’ll notice that when people on social media started calling out fake news that that’s when the platforms started cracking down and censoring vocal conservatives and libertarians. Every time the Left can’t win they try to move the goal posts instead, and I believe ALL of America sees what they’ve been doing now.
TPM: What do you think the best way to handle the uninsured is during this crisis?
MR: I think all the uninsured that get sick with corona should be treated...and then China gets the bill. In reality the government would probably pay the bill out of the stimulus package...but I think we should at least wipe our trillion debt out with China and hold them to the fire for this, honestly.
TPM: What do you think ""normal"" looks like after this for both Nevada and America?
MR: Normal is for people to go back to work and salvage what we can out of this economy...which I have faith that as Americans we can do.
With a Governor that has restricted the use of a working medication to treat coronavirus, to district Reps like Susie Lee (who I’m currently running against) that refuse to address the concerns of their constituents...this entire situation has exposed the inadequacy and pettiness of Nevada politics. If we can see this as any kind of warning...it’s that the Democrats cannot be trusted in positions of power when emergency situations arise...not without them trying to take away our rights, guns, freedoms, and pushing a socialist agenda to the detriment of American citizens apparently."

Department of Industry staff said in a report that internet-based media, like The Post Millennial, “led to the increasing fragility"" of TV networks and raised ""concerns about an increase in harmful content at Canadians’ doorstep.""
The Department of Industry is led by Liberal Minister Navdeep Bains, whose staffers believed that online media amplifies ""harmful content and activities such as hate speech and disinformation ... these new risks have the potential to impact democratic processes in Canada and weaken the cohesion of Canadian society.”
This memo precedes a proposal created earlier this year by the Liberal government that suggested the Liberals govern the internet, placing all online news media on a national registry.
Trudeau's Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault later announced this media regulation in a disastrous CTV News interview. The controversy caused by this interview later forced Guilbeault to backtrack, saying, despite the initial interview, that he was never considering a media registry in the first place.
“Voluntary measures and industry self-regulation have increasingly been shown to be inadequate to address these challenges,"" the report added.

The state New York have over 30,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, more than half of which are in New York City. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo has voiced his frustrations over a lack of aid from the federal government.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be sending 400 ventilators to New York. Governor Cuomo scoffed at that amount as it isn't even close to enough, according to CTV News.
“Four hundred ventilators? I need 30,000 ventilators,” Cuomo railed in a press briefing at Manhattan’s Javits Center. “You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? You’re missing the magnitude of the problem.”
Vice President Pence responded later in the day that FEMA shipped 2,000 ventilators to New York state, and another shipment of 2,000 ventilators is expected to arrive today.
Cuomo said of coronavirus that the “rate of increase has gone up” and that new infections are “doubling about every three days.”
“How can you have New Yorkers possibly dying because they can’t get a ventilator, but a federal agency saying I’m going to leave the ventilators in a stockpile? I mean, have we really come to that point?”
The US as a whole now has over 65,700 active cases of COVID-19 and has undergone 942 deaths. Experts are blaming, in part, New Orleans' annual Mardi Gras festivities, which were not squashed despite the pandemic, as part of the reason for the recent explosion of infections in that nation."

Police can be seen breaking up public 'gatherings' as well as closing down non-essential shops.
Police were forced to shut down Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester after people were continuing to gather despite
the government's warnings not to. ""No one was arrested. GMP officers are patrolling the city centre following the lockdown announcements."" said a spokesperson for the Greater Manchester Police.
Areas throughout Britain seem to be facing similar issues of people not adhering to the government's advice.
Police are taking to social media to send warnings to those still continuing to carry on as normal, such as Foleshill Police, in the West Midlands, who tweeted this photograph of them breaking up a barbeque party.
The new rules implemented by Boris Johnson to enforce social distancing now mean that fines can be issued on the spot, wherever these rules are disobeyed.
Matt Hancock, health secretary, told the British House of Commons that police there now have the authority to issue 'unlimited fines' to anyone who is found defying the social distancing measures. Fines will start at £30 ($51.00 CAD) but may rise indefinitely for those who don't comply.
Hancock said, ""These measures are not advice, they are rules and will be enforced, including by the police with fines starting at £30 up to unlimited fines for non compliance.""
""Home is now the front line, and in this national effort, working together, we can defeat this disease. Everyone has a part to play,"" he added.

Trump has been taking the advice of medical experts, and consulting with Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control. So to not take his advice is to not take the advice of the nation’s top experts.
The former Secretary of State tweeted, “Please do not take medical advice from a man who looked directly at a solar eclipse.”
Clinton is making a reference to Trump removing his protective eye-wear during an August 2017 eclipse and looking directly up into the sky.
Clinton has been critical of the Trump administration’s response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, proposing several policy solutions that would be immediately implemented by the White House were she in office.
One proposal would be for the federal government to implement quarantines and federally fund paid sick leave, tweeted Clinton.
Trump's handling of the COVD-19 coronavirus outbreak has been a frustration to Democrats, as now more than 46,548 people in the United States have been infected with the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been helping to ensure that Trump stays well informed, he told the magazine Science.
In the interview, Fauci said he's been working with the White House's coronavirus task force so that all the facts surrounding the pandemic are up to date and accurate although he's admitted to having some difficulty retaining Trump’s attention on these issues.
""I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down,"" said Fauci.
Trump has repeatedly said that China could have disclosed the discovery of the coronavirus as much as four months ago. The disease emerged in city of Wuhan, its location of origin, in November. Doctors began warning of the contagion in December, but were silenced by the Chinese government.
Trump has discussed a potentially successful treatment for coronavirus via the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, among others, although the FDA has neither authorized the drug nor given evidence of its efficacy.
“The information that you’re referring to specifically is anecdotal,” said Fauci of the drugs. “It was not done in a controlled clinical trial, so you really can’t make any definitive statement about it.”
Both Canada and the UK are also investigting these anti-malarial drugs for treatment of coronavirus.
Banner Health, a US healthcare company, released a statement on Monday revealing that two patients had taken chloroquine in an attempt to cure their coronavirus, resulting in one patient dying while the other is still in critical condition. However, the drugs that the couple took were actually an anti-parasite medicine for fish, that listed chloroquine on the label, and had nothing to do with the prescription medicine that is used to treat malaria."

This tax hike was originally created two years ago and was scheduled to go into effect on April 1st.
The Liberal's Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act legislation mandates a 50 percent rise in the tax from 4.4¢ a litre to 6.6¢ a litre.
When Trudeau's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland was asked about the tax hike, she said ""I think our government has been very clear that this is a time where our first priority is protecting the health and safety of Canadians, and that’s what everyone here has been very focused on.""
""We are thinking very carefully about our whole approach to what we are doing economically, both in terms of how we are supporting workers and businesses, and also what we are doing on the tax side” she added.
The carbon tax has long been a controversial in Canadian politics. In the most recent 2019 federal election, the Conservative Party ran on a platform of scrapping the tax.
Similarly, a number of premiers have called for the axing of the carbon tax: most notably, Doug Ford in Ontario and Jason Kenney in Alberta."

So far, four separate candidates have called for the party to delay or suspend the leadership race. MacKay, rather inexplicably, has urged the CPC to increase the pace of the leadership contest.
""The cutoff to become a voting member of our Party should be moved to be sooner, not later, and a vote should occur as soon as logistically possible,"" MacKay said.
The debate behind the timeline for elections has been fierce. MacKay claims that the party is in need of leadership, and that a delay would pose a the problem of their not being an adequate check on the Trudeau government.
Having said this, Andrew Scheer is still leading the Conservative Party and has been vocal in his criticism of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. There is no vacuum at the top of the Conservative Party, especially as an election seems distant.
Those who are opposed to holding the elections on the regular timeline think that it looks bad for the party to be engaging in political play during this crisis. Additionally, this is a notably bad time to undertake fundraising efforts.
Not only can campaigning not be done in person, but with layoffs and firings, there's less available money for campaign donations. But those who are in favour of holding the elections believe strongly that the current leadership is not adequate for the fight against the virus.
During a conference call on March 22, the national council of the Conservative Party, comprised of 20 members, discussed their concerns regarding the motion to propose a delay in the election, scheduled for June. Scott Lamb, council president, declared that a motion of that sort was out of order.
Fellow leadership candidate, Erin O'Toole, told CPC members in a statement on Sunday that ""we are in unprecedented times for our country.""
The CPC leadership committee ""should ensure that all time and resources of our Conservative caucus and our grassroots members can be focused on helping our constituents and the needs of our communities in the fight against COVID-19.""
Erin O'Toole is not the only candidate who has requested an extension from the LEOC. Both Marilyn Gladu and Rudy Husny also pressured the leadership body so that they would either postpone or delay the contest.
""I still fundamentally believe now is not the time to campaign,"" said Husny. ""During this national health crisis, I don’t have the heart to call our members to ask them to support my nomination and to donate money.""
""I wouldn’t be true to myself if I did,"" he added. Husny declared that he would drop out of the race unless the LEOC changed the schedule.
Marilyn Gladu also posted a statement to twitter where she criticized the LEOC. ""We are all responsible for flattening the curb,"" she said.
""I am disappointed in the apparent decision of the Conservative Party of Canada’s LEOC with respect to the Covid-19 pandemic, and their refusal to amend the 2020 leadership election schedule to address the new reality of the pandemic."""

“We received over 500,000 applications so far this week, compared to just under 27,000 applications for the same week last year,” said the Prime Minister in a recent press release. Trudeau said that Service Canada agencies have received a “historic” amount of calls this week according to Global News.
“I know people are anxious to get the help they deserve, and our government is working as fast as possible to support them. This is, of course, an unprecedented situation, and it’s putting a lot of pressure on our system, but we’re on it. Thousands of public servants are working around the clock to help you.”
Canadians who are having difficulties accessing the application system for EI programs have been told to be patient and keep trying according to a spokesperson for Employment and Social Development Canada. There have been a number of delays as a result of their systems being overwhelmed by the spike in traffic however the agency says such issues are only ""temporary.""
“ESDC is prioritizing capacity to ensure critical service delivery requirements are met. Ongoing improvements are being made on a daily basis to ensure quality and timely service to Canadians,”  a spokesperson said.
A total of $82-billion has been announced for funding the new measures to assist workers and businesses while the pandemic passes.
The federal government is proposing to extend certain benefits to those who are not eligible for employment insurance, as everyone is expected to self-isolate and many workers will have to take care of their families.
The pandemic has led to many businesses being shut down, in some provinces under government orders yet some retailers are hiring more staff to keep up with the growing demand such as food delivery services.
Walmart Canada is set to hire an additional 10,000 employees to work in its stores and distribution centres in preparation for existing employees who may get sick in the future."

The program, entitled, “Learn at Home” will help keep students on track while stuck at home.
The announcement was made by premier Ford and education minister Stephen Lecce alongside health minister Christine Elliott on Friday at Queen’s Park according to Global News.
The Learn at Home projects aims to provide both math and literacy content created by Ontario educators and will be available in both English and French.
Health minister Lecce used the speaking opportunity to assure students who were supposed to graduate this spring that their plans won’t be compromised. Working with universities and colleges, the minister said that there is “a continued application process that doesn’t get delayed,”
Ford touched on the issue as well saying, “As a father myself, I know parents always want the best for their children, and I also know from speaking to parents that many are concerned that their child is going to fall behind while schools are closed during this difficult period,”
“To support families and students, our government has developed a one-stop spot for at-home learning. It doesn’t replace school, but offers a great alternative as we approach the end of March break.”
All publicly-funded schools across Ontario were effectively closed on March 12, and things are predicted to remain that way until at least April 6. This hiatus leaves over two million students without a classroom.
Lecce said in terms of the closures being extended, he and Elliott are in constant contact with Ontario health officials and awaiting their recommendations.
In the meantime all EQAO testing has been cancelled.
Lecce explained that, “Elementary resources are designed to help young students learn at home with interactive activities that encourage participation through entertaining and stimulating digital content,”
“High school content was designed with a focus on STEM courses and ensure core competencies and skills are reinforced.”
The government also said “work is underway” to get them the necessary technology needed for any students who may not have access to a computer.
Broadcast channels TVO and TFO are also cooperating with the provincial government to create “robust education programming,” beginning as early as Monday as the students would normally return to school after March Break.
At this present time there are 301 active cases of coronavirus in Ontario with five cases being resolved thus far and two deaths.
The Learn at Home program will offer easy access to online learning resources for students from kindergarten to grade 12 that has been produced by Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) Educators."
0,2020-03-20T10:16:00.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/justice-dismantled-as-restrictions-placed-on-court-systems,Justice dismantled as restrictions placed on court systems,"As a lawyer who works each day to protect individuals’ fundamental freedoms from government encroachment, it seems surreal to watch governments around the world grant themselves emergency powers, direct a global shutdown of the economy, and curtail the freedom of citizens to assemble in large numbers—or sometimes to even leave their homes at all.
Events have been unfolding almost too quickly to fully process the implications, but it appears likely that restrictions are only going to intensify in the days and weeks ahead.
At the time of writing, the Trudeau government has not yet triggered the Emergencies Act but is said to be contemplating it. That decision may depend on whether Canadians are doing as we are told to prevent the spread of COVID-19. If not, expect that increasingly restrictive measures, accompanied by threats of fines or imprisonment, will be imposed.
In Ontario, Premier Doug Ford declared on March 17 that the province would use its emergency powers legislation to shut down non-essential businesses and prohibit public gatherings of 50 or more people. The provincial government in Newfoundland has taken that step too, and others will soon follow.
So what do these powers entail? Under the federal and provincial legislation, emergency powers generally include the ability to restrict movement, shut down businesses, impose travel bans, control the distribution of essential goods and services, and establish emergency hospitals. Private property may be commandeered as needed, perhaps for ensuring isolation of infected individuals. Should that happen, reasonable compensation must be provided by the government.
These emergency powers are time-limited, but may be extended as the government deems necessary, subject to judicial oversight. To facilitate quick actions, governments are able to make more use of orders in council (cabinet decisions) rather than going to the Legislature. The most significant purpose of federal and provincial emergencies legislation is allowing governments to spend significant amounts of money outside of the approved budget.
Our laws contemplate that sometimes governments must make orders that infringe our rights so as to meet an external threat. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the rule of law still apply, but courts will give government more latitude than usual. As long as government actions are not arbitrary, such as targeting one group over another, courts will likely uphold them as reasonable and demonstrably justified.
While emergency measures and quarantines are meant to be temporary, there is no question that they deny freedom. This may soon feel very oppressive, particularly if the crisis is measured in months, not weeks, as some experts predict.
We have a right to expect that Draconian measures are based on sound reason and science, and are imposed in the least restrictive manner possible, for the shortest duration possible. At some point, the costs of the deprivation of liberty and the shutdown of the economy could outweigh the benefits of these measures, even when viewed through the lens of saving lives.
Protracted periods of isolation and an inability to work or operate businesses, coupled with severe financial losses or dysfunctional family situations, may lead to a decline in mental health and increased suicides. For society, the shutdown could lead to an economic depression, and even civil strife. Indeed, the cure may end up being worse than the disease, if the government forces public health measures to go on longer than absolutely necessary.
If the restrictions remain short-lived, it is unlikely they would be successfully challenged in the courts. If they persist beyond what is reasonable, then the checks and balances of our court system should be engaged.
It is unsettling that some of our courts have essentially ceased operations, without facilitating video-conferencing or other “no contact” methods that could allow courts to continue dispensing justice. The shut-down of our courts will have to be temporary, and technology will need to be utilized to ensure access for constitutional challenges and judicial review, among other pressing matters, should governments prolong their emergency powers or infringe our liberties unjustifiably.
Some commentators are looking to China as a model of how to get the virus under control. China is an authoritarian state, with a compliant citizenry accustomed to harsh punishment for stepping out of line, and unburdened by notions of individual liberties. It is not easy to replicate China’s reported success without also trampling excessively on human rights.
China has also readily adopted cyber-monitoring of the movement of its people, and now even democratic Israel has moved to use cybertechnology to monitor its citizens who are supposed to be self-isolating. While it may be appealing to limit the spread of COVID-19 by any means necessary, there will be temptation to utilize technology like this against citizens when the crisis is over, and we should not be too eager to adopt it.
The more dependent we become on government in times of crisis, the more likely we are to accept erosions of our freedom, so we must remain vigilant. For now, it appears reasonable to follow medical recommendations to self-isolate, and to set aside our personal desires in favour of working together to beat this virus – otherwise, we can expect governments to force our compliance. Freedom selfishly exercised today may be freedom unwillingly lost tomorrow.
Freedom belongs to us – it is not bestowed on us by government. We relinquish it carefully and willingly on those exceedingly rare occasions when needs must. But we should have every expectation and desire to see a return of that freedom, uneroded, when the immediate crisis has passed."
0,2020-03-19T15:31:51.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/philadelphia-to-stop-arrests-for-many-non-violent,Philadelphia to stop arrests for many 'non-violent' crimes,"The Philadelphia police announced yesterday that they would stop the arrest of certain “non-violent” crimes, according to Fox29 News. This course of action is in response to the likely spread of the coronavirus through prison facilities.
The department was sure to be clear that they were not “turning a blind eye to crime.” But this statement is only partially true. The announcement described that the police would bring the offender in for paperwork before releasing them on a warrant for their arrest at a later date. The obvious issue here is that there is no timetable for when those offenders will be arrested. Simply saying “at a later date” will surely not go very far in making those in the community feel safe.
Tim Poole tweeted, “Philly is really close to implementing a ‘Purge.’”
Suspending the arrests of criminals leaves open the possibility of the offender committing more crimes before they are arrested on their original warrant. What if someone commits two crimes before “a later date” rolls around? Would that be enough to immediately arrest the offender? All of this is made unclear by the Philadelphia police’s press release.
Philadelphia not only has to worry about the contagion, but homeowners and shop owners may now be more susceptible to break-ins and robberies. Which raises perhaps the biggest question of all. Why would the Philadelphia police make their strategy known to the general public? If a criminal knows that the police department is not going to make an arrest on crimes they may commit, then it almost certainly increases the likelihood that those crimes will be committed.
There was no net benefit in letting the general population know that crimes will be committed without immediate penalty. And Philadelphia is not the only city to tamper with the problem of prison capacities.
The Los Angeles Sheriff has now made the decision to release 600 inmates “with less than 30 days on their sentences.” This line of action may not seem terrible at first glance, but the spread of the coronavirus has just begun and there is no indication that it is going to slow down. This means that if Los Angeles is to maintain its efforts to dwindle the number of inmates in its prisons to stifle the number infected by the coronavirus, it will have to continue to release inmates and/or suspend arrests until “a later date.” What if the virus stays on its course for over a year? Perhaps thousands of offenders will not have to face their sentences and thousands of prisoners will be released without serving their full term.
If this line of action has any substance to it, it is likely that other larger cities in the US will follow suit. The efficacy of suspending arrests and releasing prisoners is still unknown, but it is certain that while it may, in some cases, prevent the spread of coronavirus, it may cause community unrest and perhaps put innocent residents in danger.
These new policies are not happening in a vacuum either. They are being spearheaded by activist groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. According to the Press Herald, “The ACLU is calling for governors to grant commutations to anyone identified by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as at particularly high risk of infection and whose sentence would end within two years; to release anyone, regardless of health status, who has less than one year remaining on their sentence; and to release anyone who is being held on a technical violation, such as violating the terms of probation.”
To release anyone whose sentence would end within “two years” is a bit unsettling. In 2016, Brock Turner was given a six-month sentence for raping an unconscious woman at Stanford. Had Turner’s case happened more recently, he would be released under the ACLU’s direction. I can only wonder what that young woman at Stanford and her family would feel about the ACLU’s formula. It is pure absurdity and neglect to think that releasing inmates that have n left in their sentence is, in any way, just or productive.
If there is a highly infectious disease spreading rapidly around the world, why should we be willing to inject our friends and family with even more anxiety and panic by justifying the release of criminals who have not served the duration of their sentence, or were simply released upon commission of a crime? The long-term plan of suspending arrests and releasing prisoners means that thousands of crimes will be committed without immediate penalty and thousands of criminals will be released. All of this in order to potentially stifle the spread of a virus inside a facility that houses criminals."

The new deadline provides taxpayers with an additional month to file. Otherwise, taxpayers would have been expected to file no later than April 30 according to the Montreal Gazette.
Finance Minister Eric Girard made the announcement Tuesday and added that any money owing to the government wouldn't have to be paid until July 31.  This measure is taken so that they can offer “a reasonable amount of time” said the finance minister.
“It’s an extremely positive measure,” the minister told reporters Tuesday during a press conference in Quebec City. Individuals and companies “will have more time, more oxygen, more liquidity.”
As for businesses, the Quebec government will also suspend the need for them to pay tax installments and taxes until July 31 as well.
According to Girard, these postponements will inject $7.7 billion of liquidity into the Quebec economy. About $4.5 billion of the total amount will be from personal income taxes. The postponements will affect about 2 million individual taxpayers and 500,000 businesses.
Girard said that although Quebec’s economic future remains uncertain, the province won’t need to borrow the $7.7 billion because the province already has an abundant amount of liquidity available.
“Yes, there is economic uncertainty, but Quebec has never been in a better position from the point of view of public finances and the economy to confront adversity,” Girard said. “All the required resources for health care will be available.”
Minister Girard said the province cannot yet estimate how much the pandemic will cost because it is still very much unknown how long the crisis will last. Quebec does have a $14 billion dollar stabilization reserve however, should things get worse than predicted.
The province is also working on a package to help businesses which will be released “soon” by Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon.
“Right now, we’re managing the crisis,” Girard said. “Individuals and companies need us, and we are here for them. There will be other announcements. The federal government will be making announcements, and the government of Quebec will continue to make announcements. And when the situation stabilizes, we will look at stimulating the economy.”
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government is scheduled to make a major announcement on Wednesday regarding his administration’s plans for economic action."

The package is an effort to help Americans cope with the effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the economy according to Fox News.
“We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Mnuchin said during a press conference at the White House. “Americans need cash now, the president wants to get cash now. I mean now—in the next few weeks.”
“The president has instructed me we have to do this now,” Mnuchin added. Details such as what the amount might be has yet to be announced, however Mnuchin said the amount would be significant and that millionaires would not be eligible to receive it.
Mnuchin is putting pressure on GOP senators for a deal that would give out at least $200 billion in payments to Americans by early April.
As for a push to extend the deadline to file taxes past the scheduled April 15, Mnuchin said no, citing that taxes could be filed online.
“We encourage Americans who can file taxes to continue to file taxes on April 15 because for many Americans, you will get tax refunds and we don’t want you to lose out on those tax refunds,” Mnuchin said.
Should individuals or corporations be forced to owe money to the Internal Revenue Service after filing their taxes, those payments will now be deferred for as much as 90 days interest-free.
“If you owe a payment to the IRS, you can defer up to $1 million as an individual, and $10 million to corporations, interest-free and penalty-free for 90 days,” Mnuchin continued. “File your taxes, you’ll automatically not get charged interests or penalties.”
The new deal to provide money to Americans during this time of crisis is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. An act that was passed under former President Barack Obama, and amounted to $787 billion to help keep the economy stable.
At the same time Vice President Pence, who is in charge of the coronavirus task force said that they have plans to increase testing for COVID-19. It will now be available in all 50 states, announced Pence, saying, “state health authorities can now authorize labs in their state and expand existing testing capabilities.”
Pence claimed that the Trump administration will expand its “public-private partnership” with “vast commercial labs around the country,” which is “increasing access to coronavirus testing.”
“It is important that the American people understand that testing is happening all around the country,” Pence said, adding that experts “want me to tell the American people that you don’t need the testing to know what you should do.”
“Experts say that if every American acts on the coronavirus guidelines, we can see a substantial reduction in the spread, but as the president said, it will take all of us to do it,” Pence said, noting those guidelines rolled out by the White House and CDC Monday which included social distancing, limiting social gatherings to groups of less than 10 individuals, and staying at home.
“For the American people, as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low,” Pence said.
The coronavirus taskforce predicts that the number of cases in the U.S. will likely peak in approximately 45-days."

Their flight home from Casablanca was subsequently cancelled, leaving them stuck, desperately trying to contact the Canadian embassy, located in Rabat, Morocco’s capital, according to CTV News.
""We have been trying to get out,"" said Anthony Williams-Jones, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at McGill. ""At the airports, people are pushing and shoving. Everyone is just trying to get a seat on any plane.""
Hi everyone! My friends are quite literally stuck in Morocco after they cancelled all their flights in and out of the country. @Canada hasn't been very helpful in directing them what to do, so please share this to help get them home. @MoroccoStuck @JustinTrudeau @TravelGoC pic.twitter.com/918L3zv30k— Dawson (@theworstoomf) March 16, 2020
So far the group has had little luck with the Canadian embassy in Rabat.
""We've been trying incessantly to find other options,"" said Julia Morales, one of the students on the trip. ""Everyone was ready to go back home and now we find ourselves stranded.""
The trip to Morocco was part of a geology project and was supposed to last just two weeks. The field trip has been part of the curriculum for over 40 years.
""Each year, the students organize an international field trip,"" he explained. ""The idea is we will move through the country and look at the geology.""
The students were travelling ""off the beaten path"" for much of the time due to the nature of their trip, so they were late to find out just what was going on internationally. Unfortunately they only discovered how intense the situation had gotten on Friday. By that point, many countries had already called for lockdowns with politicians demanding closed borders.
The Canadian government has been demanding that Canadians abroad promptly return home—however, professor Williams-Jones says there is little is being done to actually help make that happen.
""What disturbs me is the response of our politicians. I think that the Canadian government could put pressure on the Moroccan government to allow planes to leave that are carrying non-Moroccans,"" he said. ""There are a lot of things that could be done right now.""
Williams-Jones told the press that the tentative plan for the moment is for the group to take flight to Qatar on Wednesday. How they'll eventually make their return to Montreal is still very much unknown.
The group has rented out an apartment in Casablanca until mid-April just in case their flight to Qatar ends up being cancelled as well.
""The morale is high. We're here for the long haul,"" Williams-Jones told CTV News. ""We're assuming that we won't get out and we will try everything to do it, but we will try to keep an environment of normalcy.""
Williams-Jones said he’s been in contact with McGill officials and hopes they will put pressure on both the Canadian government and Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau to get them back safely.
""My experience with the government is they are very, very slow to move and the only way to get the government to move is to apply pressure,"" he said. ""As of now, we're making plans to try to get ourselves out; we're doing everything we can to find flights or any mode of transport.""
A petition has been started by the group for the Canadian federal government to bring home all Canadians currently stranded abroad."

Already, the pandemic has thrown a significant wrench into the Conservative leadership race, with some candidates calling for the it to be delayed entirely.
O'Toole also wants to see the federal government invoke the Emergencies Act in order to prohibit travel and enforce self-isolation. As well as this, he suggested mobilizing the military to aid the health system during this escalating crisis.
""Now is the time to put our government and our economy on a war footing, with leadership from the top,"" said O’Toole in an email.
Public health officials nationwide have already mandated restrictions on travel and gatherings. Both of these factors are, by nature, rather problematic for a leadership campaign. Contestants who wish to be on the ballot must submit $300,000 and 3,000 signatures by March 25—a feat that is already difficult without a gloabl pandemic.
O'Toole and MacKay remain the only candidates who've been able to reach those targets, with six others candidates still racing to gather the funds and signatures.
Rick Peterson, for instance, suspended his own fundraising efforts last Tuesday. Peterson said he was looking into alternative sources to finance and asked for the deadline be moved to April 17.
""No matter how important this leadership race is, the health and well-being of family finances trumps everything today,"" he said. ""We'll not be asking individuals to send money to a political campaign at a time when every dollar counts.""
Candidate Marilyn Gladu agreed with Peterson, saying that it is morally wrong for anyone to be campaigning at all.
""Canadians are appropriately focused now on the health and safety of their families and communities,"" she said,
""There will be more than sufficient time to engage them in an effective leadership campaign when the immediate threat of pandemic COVID-19 has been eliminated.""
Having said all this, the leadership organizing committee has yet to announce that they will be making any major changes.
Both the O'Toole and MacKay campaign have accused the other of continuing to hold public events despite promising not to.
In response to O'Toole’s demand that the military be brought in to help with the COVID-19 pandemic, MacKay called for the government to quit spending its own money and instead fight the economic challenges being created by the spread of the virus.
""Before the government spends on new programs, we should help people help themselves with their own money,"" said MacKay, suggesting tax changes would be a more effective way to get cash flowing in Canada."
0,2020-03-12T14:00:00.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/if-canada-cant-define-human-being-it-cant-be-trusted-with-euthanasia,"If Canada can't define 'human being,' it can't be trusted with euthanasia","By now, anyone who dismisses concerns about euthanasia as “slippery slope arguments” should be laughed out of polite society. Bill C-7, the Canadian legislature’s answer to aligning the Medical Aid in Dying law (Bill C-14) with the The Supreme Court's Carter v. Canada decision, is exactly what critics of euthanasia expect: an expansion of the law, even past what was required by the Court in some aspects. We expect it because we’ve seen euthanasia expand, in both the letter of the law and in practice, in every other country that’s legalized killing its own citizens.
Bill C-7 goes beyond allowing people who aren’t terminally ill to be eligible for euthanasia, as the Court specified. It reduces the number of witnesses to consent required, and allows the doctor administering euthanasia to be a witness. It waives the 10-day waiting period for people whose death is “reasonably foreseeable,” and allows for “advanced consent,” by which a patient can consent ahead of time in writing before they lose the capacity to affirmatively consent to leaving the mortal realm.
Yet the Flanders region of Belgium has been known for years now to euthanize literally thousands of patients, many of them unable to consent. A 74-year old woman with Alzeihmers in the Netherlands was restrained by her own family so the doctor could execute her, despite her will stating she wanted to be euthanized “whenever she thought” the time was right.
As for C-7’s explicit exception for mental illness, it won’t last for long. Bill C-14, which legalized euthanasia in 2016, explicitly stated that “enduring physical or psychological suffering” due to a “grievous and irremediable medical condition” was a valid reason.
For those who doubt mental illness alone will soon become a qualifier, euthanasia for depression, and even Aspbergers, is not infrequent in Belgium. It happens in the Netherlands, too.
But surely assisted suicide will be restricted to those few who are suffering unbearably and won’t be a social contagion, right? About 4.5% of Dutch people die by euthanasia, and the number has climbed year over year in Oregon and Canada, too, where it’s gone from 510 per 6 months to 2600 per 6 months in three short years, excluding Quebec and three other reporting areas.
The evidence that assisted suicide laws are both slippery slopes and rife with abuse is abundant. But you shouldn’t be surprised that the government gets death so wrong when its laws don’t even start with an accurate understanding of what a human life is, much less that it is sacred.
Just before the section of Criminal Code pertaining to assisted suicide (Section 241) is a short section on infanticide. It reads, “Every one who causes the death, in the act of birth, of any child that has not become a human being, in such a manner that, if the child were a human being, he would be guilty of murder, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.""
People with a somewhat functional moral compass understand that dehumanization is evil. Yet here you have the Canadian criminal code embarrassingly defining a child being born as not yet a human being.
We experience this kind of tortured logic in the US, too, where some of the most permissive abortion laws in the world have sent the message that even separate, non-consenting human lives who inconvenience you (particularly if they are disabled) can simply be thrown in the trash. Canada, of course, doesn’t have an official law restricting abortion at all.
The culture in both countries has already accepted that human life in itself, especially in its most fragile and vulnerable states, isn’t necessarily worthy or dignified enough to warrant legal protection. If you believe that about the beginning of life, why wouldn’t you accept it at the other end as well, or when people are just too “checked out,” insane or miserable to really be a functioning member of society, to be “dignified?”
The culture of death advanced by the likes of bill C-7 is built on inherently eugenic and dehumanizing practices aimed at those who are perceived as burdens or unworthy of life, from the baby the size of a walnut to the octogenarian with severe dementia.
As I’ve written before on the connection between euthanasia and abortion, “Encouraging death at one end of life is nearly always followed by promoting death near the other end. Once you dispense with the idea that all human life is precious, you’ve gone most of the distance toward a culture that is ableist, suicidal, and eventually utilitarian to the point of purposefully seeking the elimination of the ‘burdens on society.’”
A government with laws that aren’t even medically or morally accurate about something as fundamental as who is a human being can’t be trusted to put up “safeguards” for assisted dying. Killing humans is definitively not a safe activity. It’s not something that can be protected from abuse because it is fundamentally abusive of the sanctity of life.
If Canadian lawmakers want to start rebuilding a just and equitable society, they should start with getting the definition of humanity right."

The Liberal government’s proposed legislation, introduced as a First Reading on March 9, defines “conversion therapy” as “a practice, treatment or service designed to change a person’s sexual orientation to heterosexual or gender identity to cisgender, or to repress or reduce non-heterosexual attraction or sexual behaviour.”
This proposed House of Commons legislation has the same major flaws that the Senate’s Bill S-202 had, as I argued in 2019. Under C-8, parents could spend up to five years in jail for trying to help their son accept himself as a boy, or for helping their daughter to accept herself as a girl. Bill C-8 also would impose prison terms up to five years for doctors, counsellors, psychiatrists, psychologists and other paid professionals whose treatment for gender confusion departs from politically correct orthodoxy. Parents would be punished if they do anything other than encourage a confused child to “transition” to the opposite gender. Transitioning is an extreme form of intervention that includes taking puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and undergoing permanent surgical sterilization, including the removal of healthy organs such as breasts and testicles.
Bill C-8’s preamble denounces as “myth” that a person’s “gender identity” can and ought to be changed. This ignores reality. Many people – especially some minors – do experience change in their gender identity. Confusion during puberty later resolves in favour of their biological sex. Bill C-8 ignores the leading work of Dr. Kenneth J. Zucker, who for many years was psychologist-in-chief at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and headed up its Gender Identity Service. An international authority on gender dysphoria in children and adolescents, he and Dr. Susan Bradley helped hundreds of children integrate their gender identity with their biological reality, saving them from a lifetime of dependency on cross-sex hormones. Their work demonstrates that with appropriate therapy and encouragement, the vast majority of gender-confused children come to accept their bodies by the time they reach the age of 18.
“Transitioning” is not the panacea Bill C-8 makes it out to be. For example, a 2011 comprehensive study shows that post-surgery transgender people in Sweden commit suicide at a rate 19 times higher than the national average. Bill C-8 further ignores the rapidly growing number of deeply unhappy and disillusioned people who have “transitioned” genders and are now “detransitioning” back to their biological sex.
If Bill C-8 becomes law, it appears that the only legal treatment available to Canadian youth who struggle with their gender identity will be “transitioning” toward the opposite gender: puberty blockers, opposite-sex hormone injections, and eventually gender-reassignment surgery. The law’s definition of “conversion therapy” still allows for “a practice, treatment or service that relates to a person’s exploration of their identity or to its development,” so there may be some wiggle room. But C-8’s clear prohibition on changing “gender identity” to conform to biological reality, combined with C-8’s preamble declaring that gender identity should never be changed, means that counselling to help a child accept biological reality becomes practically illegal.
The medical, psychiatric and psychological professions are divided as to what course of treatment is best for children and teenagers who feel confused about their biological gender. Emerging research shows that gender dysphoria can be a social contagion, particularly among girls using social media. The debate among experts concerning the cause and best treatment for gender dysphoria in youth is far from settled. Yet the federal government now proposes to shut down the discussion with jail terms for parents and for medical professionals.
If passed, Bill C-8 would usurp the authority of the provincial Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons to formulate evidence-based and ethical guidelines on the best treatment options for children suffering with gender dysphoria. The same goes for the professional bodies which regulate psychologists, counsellors and therapists. Politicians, most of whom have no education in the fields of medicine or psychology, are imposing their ideological and political will on the medical and counselling professions. Are medical professionals OK with politicians deciding what is the best practice?
It is a mark of cruelty to use the law to force confused, dysphoric children and their parents to embrace the transition to a life of permanent hormone therapy, surgery and disillusion. Most dysphoric children, if granted the support and opportunity, will accept and regain comfort with their biology by the age of 18. On Twitter there are hundreds of people lamenting that they were allowed to take cross-sex hormones when they were confused and vulnerable children, brainwashed by websites like Buzzfeed and their own gender-confused culture. They ask: “Why was I allowed to do this to myself? How come no one older and wiser stopped me?” Their sorrow is palpable.
Bill C-8’s all-encompassing definition of “conversation therapy” interferes in the future happiness and lives of children. Once opposite-sex hormones have wreaked havoc on a young developing body, including causing lifelong sterility, there is no going back.
Good intentions are not enough to make for good law. Canadians appreciate the importance of helping children and teens navigate the challenges of modern social media, the hyper-sexualization in our culture, body image, sexual identity and other topics in this 21st century reality. Puberty is full of angst, confusion and turmoil for many teenagers. Canadians appreciate that compassionate, loving parents, along with medical and mental health professionals using evidence-based approaches, should not face jail time for working through these challenges. Parents and medical professionals should mobilize against the ideological and knee-jerk approach of Bill C-8."
0,2020-03-07T05:30:05.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/majority-of-canadians-agree-abortion-for-sex-selection-is-wrong,Majority of Canadians agree abortion for sex selection is wrong,"On February 26, 2020, for the first time in over a decade, a bill was introduced in Parliament that included the word “abortion.” Saskatchewan MP Cathay Wagantall, introduced her private members bill, called the Sex Selective Abortion Act. This bill, which will be debated in the House of Commons later this year, would create a new penalty for doctors who knowingly perform an abortion for the sole reason that the parent(s) are not happy with the sex of the child. This bill is in line with what a vast majority of Canadians believe, that using abortion for the purpose of sex selection is wrong.
Last month, various media outlets reported with apparent surprise the nuanced opinions reflected in a recent poll asking Canadians about abortion. This surprise is understandable given the narrative of polarization we hear from our leaders, but not at all surprising to those of us on the ground in the pro-life movement. In fact, nuance and thoughtfulness are what we’ve come to expect from the majority of Canadians. And sex selective abortion is one area where the poll was crystal clear: 84 percent of Canadians believe it is wrong.
Canada is a country that values equality of the sexes, and sex selective abortion inherently denies the equal value of boys and girls. If a baby girl is unwanted simply because she is a girl, abortion rights have gone too far for most.
This is a cause that unites us. While some oppose abortion and some promote it, we should all be able to stand side by side against sex selective abortion, as we all have an interest in standing against gender inequality. And yet, groups that advocate for abortion have been either dismissive, angry, or quiet. Mara Hvistendahl, author of Unnatural Selection, notes their difficulty: “After decades of fighting for a woman’s right to choose the outcome of her own pregnancy, it is difficult to turn around and point out that women are abusing that right.”
But there is a huge middle group in society that is okay with abortion in some, but not all, circumstances. The polarizing approach has effectively silenced this group, when in fact it is this group that can help make things happen for women and children in Canada, and help our society take a stand that values life and equality. Opposition to sex selection is where we hear a shared voice.
This shared voice claims equal value for men and women, and a shared rejection of the eugenic tendencies behind “designer families” built to ideal specifications. Reproductive technologies have given us unprecedented control over the building of our families. But when they facilitate legal discrimination between the sexes, they have overstepped their bounds. In fact, the Assisted Human Reproduction Act already recognizes the risk of using reproductive technology to engage in sex selection – sex selection of embryos during in vitro fertilization treatments is illegal. It is time for the law to catch up when it comes to abortion.
For most Canadians, abortion is not a black-and-white issue. Science has done its job of proving the humanity of the pre-born child, and even of telling us what sex it is. Now society has to do its job of protecting that child when her sex is used against her.
Despite the majority of Canadians opposing the allowance of abortion for sex selection, our leaders have failed to take a stand against it. To allow abortion based on gender discrimination is to allow a society that accepts this discrimination and values people based on what they do, what they look like, or what they cannot do.
Instead of avoiding the debate or using abortion as a political weapon, we must come together on this issue. It is in the middle ground that abortion restrictions need to begin in Canada. There is clear consensus among Canadians as to where protection for the pre-born should start, and Wagantall’s bill has given our government an opening to recognize this in law, by prohibiting the inequality that is manifested by sex selective abortion. It is time for our politicians to engage in this debate so that public policy becomes more reflective of public opinion."
0,2020-03-07T04:00:16.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/safeguards-are-needed-for-those-seeking-medical-assistance-in-dying,Safeguards are needed for those seeking Medical Assistance in Dying,"When Canada legalized euthanasia, under the banalizing and misleading made-in-bureaucracy term “Medical Assistance in Dying” or MAID, the Liberals argued that the legislation represented a fine-tuned balance. The balance, they said, aimed at facilitating access on the one hand, while also providing safeguards and protecting vulnerable people from being pressured into a premature death that they do not really want.
It is not obvious that the current safeguards are working. There is a lot of remaining ambiguity around them, and annual rates of euthanasia went up by more than five times between 2016 and 2019. This follows similar trends in Belgium, where the further expansion of eligibility has been associated with dramatic increases in rates.  Existing Canadian safeguards are, frankly, quite minimal, but they still play an important role in protecting some vulnerable people.
Unfortunately, fewer than 5 years later and before a scheduled statutory review, the government is already taking further steps to remove safeguards, upsetting the so-called balance that they created. The government’s new euthanasia bill was tabled in Parliament on February 27, and the government will likely try to pass it before the end of June. This bill eliminates two vital safeguards – the general practice of a ten day reflection period before a person is euthanized, and the requirement for two independent witnesses to confirm the person’s consent. These particular provisions are not in response to any court decision.
The goal of the ten day reflection period was to recognize the reality that someone who is suffering may go through periods of extreme agony or despair which are not representative of their overall experience or wishes. It is not consistent with the principle of autonomy to allow someone to make an irreversible decision without requiring some reasonable period of reflection. All of us who have accompanied people dealing with severe illnesses know the natural variations that can exist in a person’s response. An expressed desire to die may be a sustained and consistent intention, but it may also be a short-term cry for help – for better care, better management of pain, or more love and support from others.
When I did suicide prevention training in preparation for taking on a leadership role in my university residence, we were taught to treat every expressed desire for death as a cry for help and to look for ways to address the cause of the person’s suffering. With the legal change, things are now murkier – the desire for death by certain people is now met with suicide facilitation instead of suicide prevention. How do we decide which people should receive suicide facilitation and which people should receive suicide prevention?
These may be complicated issues, but there is one thing that should be quite clear – that one important way to try to distinguish between a sustained desire for death and a short-term cry for help is to protect the existing reflection period.
Some have argued that, despite the benefits, the reflection period may unnecessarily prolong the suffering of someone who is clear in his or her desire to die. But the reality is that the law already allows for the reflection period to be waived. It does not amount to an iron-clad rule. It is, rather, a standard that should apply in most cases but does not have to apply in every case.
The concrete implications of removing the reflection period is that someone could ask for and receive euthanasia all in the same day. If someone’s pain management is off for a brief period of time, they could quickly be moved from the beginning to the end of the process, without any engagement of independent witnesses or family members.
The existing requirement for two independent witnesses to confirm a person’s consent was also created with a clear purpose in mind. The vast majority of healthcare providers have good intentions and wish to studiously stay within the confines of the law. But the data from other jurisdictions shows that a small number of “envelope-pushing” healthcare providers can be over-represented in problematic cases. Safeguards that require the presence of independent witnesses might not be necessary in most cases, but the risk of lives be taken under improper circumstances in a minority of cases by a small number of activist euthanizers is real. Independent witnesses confirming consent can guard against this.
Let’s remember that the purpose of safeguards in general is to address exceptional cases. The reason we need law enforcement is not because most people are lawbreakers, but because some people are lawbreakers. The reason we have fire departments and expansive rules and protocols around fire prevention is not because most houses are on fire, but because some houses could catch fire. Advocating for safeguards is not rooted in a mistrust of healthcare professionals in general, but rather in a recognition that abuse can happen and can be deadly. It’s hard to believe that the presence of a couple independent witnesses could be seen as a serious impediment for someone who is clear in their desire to be euthanized.
Some people are pushing the envelope already. Doctor Ellen Wiebe euthanized Barry Hyman on June 29, 2018. She did so after entering the Jewish nursing home where he lived and closing his door, and without informing or consulting with nursing home staff. His primary caregivers had no idea what was happening. Perhaps Dr. Wiebe had good intentions, but someone sneaking into a nursing home and then asking us to trust her own notes as evidence of consent raises serious concerns. In this case there also seems to have been a real failure to consider the traumatic effects on other residents, in light of their backgrounds. As the CEO of the nursing home said following the incident: “Imagine the implications for our staff and our residents and their families. We have a lot of Holocaust survivors. To have a doctor sneak in and kill someone without telling anyone. They’re going to feel like they’re at risk when you learn someone was sneaking in and killing someone.”
We need to preserve the limited safeguards that currently exist, and it is wrong for the government to be trying to remove them."

The investment, which broke Friday morning, is penned to be the largest investment by any provincial or federal government.
The $202 million figure will be tacked on to the already existing $105 million from an existing fund. That fund covers all bases—including law enforcement tools and public awareness campaigns.
Specialized intervention teams, bringing awareness about human trafficking into the education curriculum and housing for victims are all on the agenda for the new budget. There is also a proposal to invest funding into community support groups and Indigenous-led initiatives.
“Human traffickers prey on the most vulnerable members of our society – our children,” Mr. Ford said in a statement.
“We must put an end to this disgusting industry and take immediate steps to keep our kids safe.”
Ford will announce the details and long term plans for the funding in St. Catharines, Ont., with Solicitor-General Sylvia Jones and Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women’s Issues.
Ms. Dunlop has stressed the important need for victims to have ongoing support in order for them to, “heal from their trauma and rebuild their lives.”
The statistics reveal that Ontario is certainly the province most in need of making a better effort to combat sex trafficking. Two-thirds of all police-reported human trafficking violations for the entire country occur in Ontario, with 13 being the average age of those recruited.
There are 42 sexual-assault centres in Ontario and an additional $2 million will go to aiding the costs of those centres.
Megan Walker, executive director of the London Abused Women’s Centre, which currently serves 125 victims of sex trafficking, was very impressed with the layout of the new strategy to fight the issue. Walker even went as far as to call it the “most comprehensive plan to address human trafficking” that she has ever seen.
“It covers all of the pillars that we consider to be so crucial to helping end trafficking in the long-term, including public awareness, ensuring that the law is enforced or that new legislation is created and to make sure that survivors have immediate access to service as well as safe houses,” she said to the Globe, adding praise for its inclusion of specific programs of counselling and support for Indigenous women and girls.
“This is not tokenism, there is $307-million that they are investing into this and … that is an incredibly significant amount of money that will go a long way in helping us keep women and girls safe.”
Though Ontario’s initiative is impressive, it’s clear that provincial and federal leaders have made fighting human trafficking a top priority.
In 2019, federal leaders announced a $57 million investment over five years.
In 2016, Quebec announced that it would invest $200 million to be spent over five years.
British Columbia has provided $37 million in annual funding to victim services for women."

When addressing a crowd in Kerman on Thursday, Hossein Salami said that the outbreak in Iran, “may be the product of the American biological invasion.”
Salami did not provide any evidence to support his claims about the virus, which scientists believe was transferred from animals to humans last year in China.
“We will win in the fight against the virus, which may be the product of the American biological invasion, which first spread to China and then to Iran and the rest of the world,” he said.
“Today the country is engaged in a biological battle,” said Salami, according to a ISNA news agency. “Even today, we will win, even in the fight against the virus. The U.S. must know that if it did it, [the virus] will return to it.”
Theories like these are common among the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and has become more usual since the death of Quassem Soleimani, which was a result of U.S. drone strike in January.
On Tuesday, it was also suggested by Gholam Reza Jalali, an Iranian civil defence chief, that the outbreak of the virus is a “biological attack” against the Iran and China.
There are still scientific investigations under way on the virus, though there is no evidence to show that it was deliberately manufactured. The origin of the virus, which emerged from near a seafood market the city of Wuhan, in China, is still unknown.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, “Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.”
“Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread.”
There were 15 deaths announced in Iran Today, bringing the total number to 107. Iran has the highest reported death toll outside of China. There were 591 cases of coronavirus reported by the Islamic republic, which brings the total number to 3,513.
Many suspect that the figures provided by the regime are lower than the actual numbers.
Brian Hook, U.S. Special Representative for Iran and Senior Policy Advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told European reporters that “Iran lied to its own people about the coronavirus.”
“It told them it was not anything to worry about but at the same time the virus was spreading throughout Iran.”
There is also a shortage of medical equipment, face masks, and ventilators in Iran, and Friday prayers have been canceled in the country’s major cities for a few weeks running.
Health minister Saeed Namaki noted that “Schools and universities will be closed until the end” of the school year.
“People should not consider this as an opportunity to go traveling,” said Namaki. “They should stay home and take our warnings seriously.”
“This virus is highly contagious. It is a serious matter, do not joke about it.”
According to Namaki, the country has started implementing a national plan to fight the virus and will start in the locations most affected by it. “Our method is not going into homes,” Namaki said. “We can use digital communications and ultimately the telephone. So we don’t see a reason to go to the doors of peoples’ homes.”

The French and English Catholic school boards are two of Ontario’s biggest teacher’s unions, and they have decided they will go ahead with the strike according to CTV News.
These additional school board strikes come after the Ford government agreed to relinquish their previous demands to increase the number of students per classroom, as well as dropped the requirements for mandatory e-learning.
Minister of Education Stephen Lecce has said that the Ford government’s decision to walk back their demands should prompt all four major teachers’ unions to return to the bargaining table.
The striking teachers will be joined by public high school teachers, who will also hold a walkout at nine other school boards, as part of their union’s current series of rotating, one-day strikes.
The teachers’ picket will take place at the provincial legislature on Thursday morning. Union members from both the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation and Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association  will be in attendance."

Last week, Veilleux wrote a letter to Quebec Premier Francois Legault suggesting a “specialized team of Canadian Armed Forces” accompany Quebec police if they are to intervene on the Kahnawake reserve.
The letter was written after Veilleux learned that a .50 calibre machine gun was seized by Peacekeepers—among other weapons last January according to La Presse.
Veilleux’s letter read, “This type of weapon, it should be specified, is used among other things, according to what is revealed to us on the site of the Government of Canada/Armed Forces, to pierce armour!”
Prime Minister Trudeau noted that he preferred the current negotiations, saying, “We have productive negotiations going on with the Mohawks. We recognize that it takes time.”
Trudeau previously stated that he does not want the confrontation with the Kahnawake to have similar optics to the Oka crisis in the 90s, a land dispute between the Mohawk people and the town of Oka, Quebec.
“Even if we have been able to restore the transportation of goods by CN, there are impacts on the commuter train [because of the blockade in] Kahnawake. We hope to be able to resolve this in a sustainable and peaceful manner soon.”
“We recognize that it is up to Quebec to manage a potential police intervention. We can settle this in a peaceful and lasting way,” added Trudeau
“There is no question of sending the Army against Canadian citizens. I have enormous confidence in our police forces and we have full confidence in the capabilities of the [provincial] government.”"

Media reports have been somewhat even handed as the press tries not to freak out the public. While this is a departure from their usual tack, it has created a situation where neither the alarmist nor calm and collected approach seem entirely accurate.
At the higher levels of industry and politics, however, action is being taken.
President Trump has given his 4th quarter salary to the Department of Health and Human Services to aid the efforts at prevention and treatment of the virus.
Vice President Mike Pence, who is taking the lead on the federal government’s response to Covid-19, said that testing should be widespread, and not isolated to either extreme cases or to those individuals who can be tracked to someone or someplace that has an outbreak.
“When I talked to some state officials,” Pence said to reporters at the White House, “there was a sense that the tests would not be administered to people that were mildly symptomatic. We’re issuing clear guidance that subject to doctors’ orders, any American can be tested.”
This is a welcome directive to those who have sought testing and found it difficult to access.
The Federal Reserve is releasing a report today that will give a sense of the effect the virus is having on global supply chains. The Fed cut interest rates by half a percentage point yesterday, in anticipation of these findings, and in hopes that this will curb the economic impact of the virus on U.S. markets.
Mark Zuckerberg took to his platform Facebook to announce that “Through a partnership between [the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative] and the Gates Foundation, researchers in Cambodia were able to sequence the full genome of the virus that causes COVID-19 in days, making it much easier and faster for them to identify if people had the virus.”
He went on to say that “The team created a new public version of the IDSeq tool so scientists everywhere can study the full genome within the broader context of coronavirus sequences uploaded around the world.”
Facebook has offered free ad space to the World Health Organization (WHO) as well, so that they can get information out to the public with ease.
At a press conference in Switzerland, the WHO’s director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while Covid-19 results in more fatalities than the seasonal flu, it is not as easily transmitted.
“Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported Covid-19 cases have died,” Dr. Tedros said. “By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected.” Included in this estimate are the increasing cases in Iran, Italy, and South Korea.
Italy has closed schools and universities, India has halted export of many pharmaceuticals, France may have to dispense with kissing. As cases begin popping up in New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that he could do something if he wanted to. Meanwhile, each state in the union appears to be taking their own version of precautions. Strong government and industry leadership are essential in efforts to curb outbreaks and prevent fatalities."

The Public Health Agency of Canada activated the Health Portfolio Operations Centre to ensure effective planning and coordination of the Agency’s response efforts, in collaboration with international, federal, provincial, and territorial partners.
The Public Health Agency of Canada, through Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, is also in close contact with provincial and territorial Chief Medical Officers of Health to share information, coordinate response efforts, and support informed vigilance as the situation evolves.
A Special Advisory Committee of Canada’s Chief Medical Officers of Health and senior public health officials is in place and focused on the coordination of federal, provincial and territorial preparedness and response across Canada’s health systems.
Public Safety Canada has initiated the Government of Canada Operations Centre to coordinate activities across federal departments and agencies.
Routine traveller screening procedures are in place at all of Canada’s ports of entry, and additional border screening measures have been expanded to all international airports in Canada to help identify any travellers returning to Canada who may be ill, and to raise awareness among travellers about what they should do if they become sick.
There is currently a total of 33 cases of confirmed coronavirus in Canada."

CdeBaca quoted a since-deleted tweet that said, “For the record, if I do get the coronavirus I’m attending every MAGA rally I can.”
The Councilwoman responded by saying, “#Solidarity Yaaaas!!”

Thousands of people responded to CdeBaca’s surprising tweet.

A statement was released by CdeBaca’s office dismissing the tweet as a joke. “Councilwoman CdeBaca made a sarcastic tweet on Twitter to call attention to the Trump administration’s downplaying of the Coronavirus outbreak as a ‘hoax’ no more dangerous than the common flu.”
It’s important to note, though, that Trump did not call the coronavirus a hoax. The full quote, which Trump gave during a rally in Charleston, South Carolina.
“One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia. That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’ve been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost, it’s all turning. Think of it, and this is their new hoax.’”
At South Carolina Trump says #Coronavirus is ""their new hoax"", says there are 15 people in the United States and that the country is ""so united"".

The news that Trump called the coronavirus a “hoax” spread like wildfire, tricking many, including Councilwoman CdeBaca. This omits the fact that even Facebook fact-checkers called the story fake news.
CdeBaca’s comment continued, “Rather than conservative outlets making a four-day-old Tweet their focus on Super Tuesday, they should focus their energy on demanding a competent Federal response to this public health crisis instead.”

The Colorado Republican Party responded to CdeBaca’s tweet with a statement saying, “Councilwoman CdeBaca praising a social media post calling for Trump supporters to be infected with the coronavirus is simply disgusting.”
“There can be no room in our politics for wishing harm on Americans who have different political beliefs. Democrats in Colorado and across the country need to condemn this evil statement. In light of these comments, the Colorado Republican Party is calling on Councilwoman CdeBaca to resign immediately.”"

“We need candidate who cares about all Americans and will restore decency, dignity to the office. There is a reason Trump fears @joebiden and roots for Bernie,” Comey tweeted, along with a “Biden2020” hashtag.

Initially, Comey supported Sen. Amy Klobuchar, but he is just one of many high-profile endorsements for Biden in lieu of Biden’s landslide win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday. Biden received 48.4 percent of the vote in South Carolina, Sanders, on the other hand, finished in second place with 19.9 percent. Other high profile endorsements came in on Monday from former 2020 Democratic candidates, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke and Amy Klobuchar.
The only way we beat Trump is through a politics that reflects the decency of the American people. It’s what we sought to practice in my campaign—and it’s what @JoeBiden has practiced his whole life.

In October 2016, Comey reopened an investigation into Hilary Clinton’s infamous private email server after the FBI discovered emails on Anthony Weiner’s laptop who was married to Clinton aide Huma Abedin and many believe this was the reason for Clinton losing the election in 2016.
Comey closed the FBI’s investigation of Clinton on July 5, 2016. The investigation of Weiner’s laptop was shut down just days before the vote in the general election.
President Trump has recently made the claim that the Democratic party is stacking the deck against Sanders, a democratic socialist according to The Daily Caller."

I am one of the few who has argued that a commitment not only to secularism, but the appearance of secularism when representing the state, as an expression of the common social vision, is justifiable and even worthy of praise.
Nobody has ever pretended that any woman wearing a cross around her neck or any man wearing a kippah was the impetus for this bill. Everyone understands that it is the hijab that is the irritant. And many hijab-wearing Muslim women happen to gravitate toward teaching as a profession. One of my arguments in support of the bill was that the hijab was more than “just” a head covering.
Unlike the cross or the kippah, the hijab is highly politicized and often associated with coercion in the wearing of it and punishment for the refusal to wear it in Islamic countries. In Iran, for example, it is considered a symbol of Islamic triumphalism, and some brave women who publicly reject it have suffered grave retribution for their dissent.
It is easy for non-Muslim Canadians, for whom the hijab is an entirely neutral accessory, to wax on about freedom of religion and a woman’s choose. But for Muslim women who want nothing to do with the hijab, it can be quite triggering to see it on teachers of their children.
Le Devoir has just reported on allegations of hijab-wearing teachers proselytizing children in classrooms. The allegations arose in the context of a permitted intervention by the group Pour le Droit des Femmes du Québec (PDF Quebec – For the Rights of Women of Quebec) during the judicial hearings over Bill 21.
PDF Quebec presented the case of Ines Hadj Kacem and of Ferroudja Si Hadj Mohand, two Muslim immigrants who wish to raise their daughters in an environment of complete gender equality. They allege that two Montreal public schools have failed them in this respect.
“I left Tunisia so that my daughter could grow up in a milieu that is respectful of her choices and decisions,” Hadj Kacem declared in a sworn statement. She said that her daughter was enrolled in the daycare in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve public school.
The girl had been submitted to pressure from veiled teachers to thank Allah at the end of meals and told not to eat the school food because it wasn’t halal or might contain pork. She was told to behave like a “good Muslim,” alleges her mother. Mme. Kacem said she finally withdrew her daughter from the daycare after having complained about this several times to the school authorities without redress.
In her sworn statement, Mme. Kacem also said, “I have the strong impression that wearing a religious symbol by people in a position of authority influences the behaviours of my daughter and makes her question her own choices and those of her mother.”
She added that her daughter is also made uncomfortable by other children in her unit because she does not wear a cover. All that, Mme. Kacem says, “demonstrates prejudice against what we came to find in Quebec, namely equality between women and men.”
The other witness, Mme. Mohand, recounted that a hijab-wearing teacher was said to have intervened when a nine-year-old friend of her daughter’s removed her hijab in the courtyard of the Montreal North school they both attended. The teacher allegedly said that once a girl begins wearing the hijab, it must not be removed. Then, turning to Mme. Mohand’s daughter, she asked her when she was going to start wearing it. The girl said she felt “embarrassed” and obliged to answer “maybe in high school.”
Mme. Mohand stated that she had had a long conversation with her daughter, explaining she had no obligation to lie concerning her belief in order to please a teacher. The lawyer for PDF Quebec, Christianne Pelchat, former president of the Council for the Status of Women, told Le Devoir that these two witnesses are very important: “It demonstrates that the proscription of religious symbols amongst certain state employees is completely legitimate and takes into account the right of women to equality, with respect to their religious freedom and the right not to be the object of proselytism.”
To those who say that Bill 21 will prevent religious Muslim women from entering the teaching profession, it is better that religiously orthodox Muslim women like the teachers in these cases seek employment in the private teaching sector, where their views are welcome. This is preferable to subjecting Muslim girls who prefer not to wear the hijab to the kind of treatment outlined above.
Freedom of religious expression via religious symbolism should never trump the freedom not to wear religious symbols. The scenarios here would never have happened in the cases of a cross-wearing or kippah-wearing teacher. The hijab does at times represent a qualitative and consequential departure from the customary norms of Canadian society. We should all grasp the nettle of this reality, as Quebec already has, and admit that Bill 21 is a law worth our respect. Indeed, it is worthy of emulation by other provinces."

It was set up on Monday in support with the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs who are against the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline.

They say that though there is a tentative deal, “they did not reach an agreement on Coastal Gas Link”. pic.twitter.com/Su4KVIgWq3— Mike Armstrong (@ArmstrongGN) March 2, 2020
This most recent barricade is in response to senior ministers of the federal government, the B.C. provincial government and hereditary chiefs who had a meeting to strike a proposed agreement on land rights.
The group, calling itself Southwest Solidarity With Wet’suwet’en, laid the barricade on a train bridge over Wellington Street. They released a statement saying the blockade is a result of the presence of RCMP and the Coastal GasLink pipeline on the territory in northern B.C.
“We are blocking this rail line in response to the call from Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs to support Indigenous sovereignty and in recognition of the urgency of stopping resource extraction projects threatening future generations,” said Sara Mullins, a participant in the protest.
CN Railway confirmed via one of their spokespersons that they are aware of the protest and are monitoring the situation closely, according to Global News.
After three days of negotiation, a draft agreement was reached on Sunday, although it still requires the approval of the Wet’suwet’en before final approval. Still much of the details of the agreement remain unknown, and a joint statement from both parties states that they have yet to come to an accord on the CGL pipeline.
The blockade is one of many that have sprung up across the country since early last month. Transportation and freight deliveries have been disrupted, delayed or cancelled, causing a dip in the economy.
There are two other rail blockades in Quebec in spite of the proposed deal. The Mohawk community of Kahnawake will decide what steps it will take regarding the future of their barricade after they receive more details of the deal. There are no current plans to dismantle it.
In the Gaspé region of northern Quebec, protesters continue their blockade in the Mi’kmaq community of Listuguj."
0,2020-03-03T05:34:49.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/censorship-coming-under-proposed-canadian-communications-commission,Censorship coming under proposed Canadian Communications Commission,"The underlying message of the federal government’s new plans for a regulatory Communications Commission is that the government is here to help curate the internet for Canadians. The proposed Commission would decide what sort of online content is to be “trusted.” It may be meant to comfort complacent Canadians, but it isn’t comforting at all. Such a gambit would provide the administrative state the ability to restrict media that it simply doesn’t like, under the guise of wanting to protect us all from “harmful content.”
The Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislative Review Panel’s report, issued January 29, 2020, threatens “a free, unfettered internet through which Canadians can speak, learn and communicate without permission of the state,” argues Peter Menzies of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. This report recommends “a sweeping series of interventions that would make all online media – from online sites such as Rabble to Rebel News, and in any language – subject to government regulation.”
“That’s right: After more than a century of non-interference in speech through telecommunications, it is suggested that the state will determine what constitutes news and, when the proposed objectives of the act are included, “trusted” news,” Menzies explained in the Globe and Mail.
“Yet,” he goes on to say, “there are no recommendations among the 97 listed regarding safeguarding the independence of the regulator of news from political interference or of improving transparency regarding its decisions.”
As if to prove Menzies’ point, federal Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault stated on February 2 that “If you’re a distributor of content in Canada … we would ask that they have a license, yes.”
“We will not impose licensing requirements on news organizations nor will we regulate news content,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared a day later. No doubt he was responding to outrage from media people across the country and from the full range of the political spectrum.
This backtracking should be welcomed as a positive signal for preserving Canada as a free society. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister’s statement appears to have been nothing more than a temporary deflection of criticism. The plan to monitor and regulate the internet carries on in other forms, like a proposal for a new study that would require internet platforms to do the dirty work of censoring.
The Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage emerged with a resolution on February 26, stating: “It was agreed, — That the committee undertake a study of the creation and implementation of new measures for online media platforms and internet service providers requiring them to monitor, address and remove content that constitutes hate speech and remove any other content which is illegal in Canada or prohibited by the Criminal Code such as incitement of violence, incitement of genocide, creation or distribution of terrorist propaganda and exploitation of children, in a timely manner.”
It seems that the federal government is trying to gain an acceptable foothold into the regulation of online content, including news media, by referring to the elimination of the most egregious and criminal content out there – terrorism, child pornography and incitement to violence and genocide. If this Committee’s resolution merely required online media platforms and internet service providers to remove content that violates Canada’s Criminal Code, it would amount to no more than redundant virtue-signalling. Owners and managers of websites are already in the practice of not posting illegal or criminal content, or removing it when it slips through. They don’t need further resolutions to ensure that they comply with existing law.
But the Committee doesn’t stop at mere virtue-signalling. Rather, it proposes to study the banning of “hate speech” as something separate and different from illegal content prohibited by the Criminal Code.  Banning “hate speech” without clearly defining “hate speech” is a serious threat to freedom of expression. People have subjective and very different experiences as to what they feel is hateful or not hateful. Hate, like beauty and like extremism, is in the eye of the beholder.
The Committee proposes that online media platforms and internet service providers do the work of monitoring and removing any content “that constitutes hate speech” on the government’s behalf. That is precisely the sort of subjective and open-ended power that can easily be abused and broadened to remove content that someone finds objectionable, but that doesn’t rise to the high threshold of being criminal. We have already seen Twitter, Facebook, Google and YouTube move to censor or penalize politically incorrect speech, such as Meghan Murphy being banned from Twitter for “misgendering” someone.
More and more, political activists are quick to denounce as “hateful” whatever they disagree with. This kind of name-calling is already having a chilling effect on the public debate on virtually all social and political issues. Empowering government bureaucrats with the authority to censor what they subjectively feel to be “hateful,” or mandating independent companies to engage in censorship on their behalf, will only serve to punish “wrongthink” while stifling the necessary discourse and exchange of ideas that permit a free society to flourish."

This comes just a day after Buttigieg’s withdrawal from the race and as the moderate wing of the Democratic Party united around the former Vice President to ensure the win for the Democratic nomination over Bernie Sanders.
Buttigieg’s endorsement is reportedly being brought forth in Dallas at a Biden campaign on Monday. This follows the dropout of another candidate, Amy Klobucher who is now showing her support to Biden as well and plans on attending the event in Dallas. On Monday, Senate majority leader Harry Reid also endorsed Biden.
Buttigieg aimed to be seen as a representative of generational change. He has rarely had bad things to say about Biden. The former Mayor brought his campaign towards the centre and made stronger arguments against Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Buttigieg previously made the argument that Sanders could not win over President Trump because he is too far left. He is giving his support to Biden as voters are too divided to keep Sanders from moving forward. He also feared that a nomination for him would put the Democrats’ House majority in jeopardy as well as state-level elections.
Buttigieg was able to win 26 delegations during the four early states. The biggest help Buttigieg could give to Biden is most likely his strong fund-raising base. Buttigieg was able to raise more than Biden during every period of fundraising in 2019.
Buttigieg’s fund-raisers and donors were being contacted by Biden’s staff members just hours after his withdrawal. While Representative Don Beyer quickly showed new support to Biden many others said they would most likely show their support in the future but are hesitant to do so now after suggesting he was too old to take the win over President Trump."

The talks were held in Smithers, B.C. The pipeline has been at the centre of protest, just one of many that have disrupted both rail lines and road traffic across the country.
The Wet’suwet’en people are governed by both elected band councils and a traditional hereditary chief system. All of the elected band chiefs have voted to approve the CGL pipeline, but some of the hereditary chiefs, are deeply opposed to the pipeline running through their traditional territory.
The subject of the conversation was centred around land titles and Indigenous rights although precise details of the draft accord have not yet been released. There has also yet to be an agreement on the Coastal GasLink pipeline according to a joint statement by representatives of the Wet’suwet’en nation and the provincial and federal government.
One of the Wet’suwet’en hereditary leaders, Chief Woos said that the “degree of satisfaction is not what we expected”, despite him calling the draft a milestone for everyone involved, according to Global News.
Coastal GasLink issued a statement saying it would resume construction activities in the Morice River area on Monday following the announcement of the proposal. All work on the pipeline had been put on pause for the duration of the talks which began on Thursday.
Kenneth Deer, the secretary of the Mohawk Nation of Kahnawake, said that activists have decided to maintain their rail blockade on the territory south of Montreal until they receive more details on the proposed arrangement before they decided to remove any blockades."

The blockade will reportedly stay in place in Kahnawake until details of the agreement are learned by the community. The agreement still needs to be approved by the Wet’suwet’en people.
The Kahnawake rail blockade is still standing.
Mohawk activists are continuing to hold down the fort even as the situation in British Colombia seems to be improving.

The secretary of Kahnawake, Kenneth Deer noted that there will be a meeting taking place on Monday night and residents have been asked to join in the discussion.
“It is a big decision whether or not to dismantle a barricade,” said Deer on Sunday. “They want to make sure they have all the details of the deal before making this decision.”
The arrangement took three days of negotiations though the draft accord details weren’t disclosed.
Federal and British Columbia governments and the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs released a joint statement saying that an agreement concerning pipeline construction was not reached.
The $6.6 billion Coastal GasLink pipeline project has caused protests to spread throughout the country. Commuter and freight trains have been halted as a result of the anti-pipeline protests.
The blockade in the Mohawk community of Kahnawake has been present for over three weeks. It started on Feb. 10 and has blocked a train line that brings passengers to and from Montreal.
Mohawk activists noted that they will stay at the blockade for as long as it takes to fight for their rights and their land."

Travis Toews will be delivering his plan to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. He will be addressing the provincial budget and government plans to increase investment and competitiveness according to CTV News.
Toews called 2020 a “turnaround year” for Alberta though not everyone shares his optimistic view.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused oil prices to fluctuate and has impacted trade relations with the U.S. and China.
On Thursday, North American benchmark oil prices dropped below US $47 per barrel. Alberta is budgeting for US $58 per barrel.
Toews’ plan involves lowering corporate taxes and also cutting red tape. He believes that the plan will bring in investments of approximately four billion dollars every year by 2023. Toews also says that the plan will create 55,000 jobs every year by 2022.
ADs
Last month, Alberta’s unemployment rate grew to 7.3 percent making the finance minister’s goal seem very ambitious.
Toews expects that rate to fall to 5.1 percent in the next couple of years.
The Conference Board of Canada, on the other hand, expects the rate to go to 7.8 percent this year and stick to 7.7 percent by 2023.
ADs
Opposition Leader Rachel Notley and Shannon Phillips, an NDP finance critic, have both called the finance minister’s numbers “fantasy” projections.
Notley also claimed that there is no practical plan being put into place to create jobs.
According to Toews, $6.9 billion will be spent this year on capital projects to help support an extra 3,000 jobs.

Toews noted that more investments into the Dow petrochemical facility and a Suncor wind power project worth $300 million will help employment.
The first steps in the UCP blueprint will be addressed by Alberta’s Premier Jason Kenny as well as Energy Minister Sonya Savage on Monday in Leduc, Alberta."

“Canada highly values its long-standing relationships with Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain, and Qatar,” said the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, P.C., M.P., Minister of Foreign Affairs, who made the announcement. “I am pleased to have Mr. Clark’s support as we campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council.”
Clark will endeavour to strengthen Canada’s relationships with these four nations and discuss ideas for how best to collaborate and cooperate on regional security, trade, and other areas. Canada’s contributions to a Security Council that is able to adapt and respond to peace and security challenges internationally are at the top of Clark’s agenda.
“I look forward to helping strengthen these important relationships,” Clark said, “including on issues such as peace and security. Canada is committed to working together with our partners toward a more peaceful and inclusive world.”
Canada has a recent history with Algeria when the two nations joined to launch the Global Counterterrorism Forum in 2011. They were co-chairs of the Capacity-building in West-Africa Region Working Group until 2019. Egypt and Canada have cooperated on international peacekeeping efforts in the Sinai region.
Canada has a current troop deployment to a multinational coalition based in Bahrain to oversee counter-terrorism in the Horn of Africa region. Qatar has an outpost of the College of the North Atlantic, which has graduated over 4,500 students since 2002.
The region is the eighth-most important trading partner to Canada, with the value of bilateral trade to the area (excluding Israel) reaching $12.44 billion in 2018, and the number of students attending universities in Canada topping 29,000.
With a seat on the UN Security Council, Canada anticipates continued work with partners in the Middle East and North Africa toward the goals of peace, addressing climate change, promoting economic security, gender equality, and multilateralism."

A survey of over 5,000 US adults was conducted from 2017-18 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that measures people’s height and weight discovered the staggering numbers.
The news findings are actually up two percent from a similar study conducted in 2015-16 from 40 percent to 42 percent. The severe obesity rate increased by one percent as well, moving from eight percent to nine percent over the same time frame.
The numbers haven’t raised enough for it to be considered statistically significant, however the trends suggest that adult obesity will continue to grow according to Cynthia Ogden, one of the authors of the report released this week.
Americans that were considered severly obese in 1970 was only about one in 100, a number that is ten times more common today. The overall obesity rate has gone up by about 40 percent since 2000.
These numbers suggest that an increase in Americans with diabetes, heart disease and cancer are likely to coincide with the rise in obesity according to Dr. William Dietz, an expert on obesity at the University of George Washington.
Dietz also alluded to the increasing difficulty en route to care for the rise in severly obese people, estimating that the average, primary care doctor is already treating about 100 severly obese patients.
“How’s a provider going to do that? Severe obesity really requires very intensive therapy,” he said.
The survey only researched US adults and these numbers don’t apply to kids or teens, although Ogden said that a study covering that may come out later this year. Obesity of kids and teens was 18.5 percent in 2015-16, while just shy of six percent were considered to be severly obese.
Dietz claims the responsibility falls on the US government for not creating more programs to promote physical activity and healthier eating. Dietz suggested that passing a national tax on sugary beverages could reduce the consumption of them as well as building more sidewalks.
Obesity is one of America’s leading public health problems."

Currently, of Canada’s 13 reported cases of COVID-19, six of them, including the recent case in Quebec, are linked to Iran. As of February 23, Iran has been added to the Government of Canada’s Travel and Tourism advisories for nations impacted by the coronavirus. Iran is currently listed as a Level 2 nation, with travellers being warned of an outbreak in the region and to take special precautions for travel.
Per Global News, Professor of Public Health Ashleigh Tuite says the Iranian government’s figures are not to be trusted due to the presence of the disease in Canada originating in Iran.
“Compared to other countries, Canada has relatively low connectivity with Iran via air travel,” she said.
“[The] fact that we’re seeing cases in Canada linked to Iran suggests that the outbreak in Iran is much larger than has been officially reported. It’s likely been circulating in the country for a while.”
According to BBC News, Iranian whistleblowers have reported the death toll from coronavirus at 210–meanwhile the Government of Iran is only reporting 34, and denying a widespread coverup of infections and deaths. The nation currently has the highest mortality rate for the virus anywhere in the world, including China, which has been on a widespread quarantine since December of 2019.
On February 25, Iran’s Minister of Health appeared on national television to dispel public concerns about the coronavirus. Many noted he appeared to look ill. It was confirmed shortly after that he had been infected with COVID-19.

Until the problem is fixed the province will return to the previous white-with-blue-lettering plates for the intermittent period.
Complaints from police officers and drivers had been pouring into the government over the inability to read the licence plates at night because of the blue on blue design.
Initially the Ford government had denied any issues with the new plates before eventually admitting that the aesthetic was in fact difficult to read and that they needed to be changed.
Service Ontario will stop issuing the plates the new plates by March 5, announced the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. Instead they will return to the old white embossed plates however the current stock of those plates won’t be available for distribution until March 16, according to CTV News.

Nova Scotia Senator Mary Coyle has asked Canadians to take action in fighting climate change.
In a statement released on Feb. 6 Coyle wrote, “We inch closer and closer to irreversible damage. There is a need to act now and to take bold steps in addressing this crisis.”
Coyle was appointed by the Trudeau government to the Senate in 2017 after serving as the vice president at St. Francis Xavier University. Her total bill came to $16,778 for air travel. Thousands of the kilometers traveled were for events which were listed as business meetings.
Executive assistant Lili-Anne Delage Larson said, “Senator Coyle is very conscious of the effect of Senate travel on greenhouse gas emissions and as a result limits her travel when possible.”
A Notice of Inquiry was sponsored by Coyle to show a necessity to “reverse human-caused climate change to ensure a healthy planet”.
“We have ten years to quickly steer ourselves onto the right pathways,” Coyle said to the Senate. “In order to do this, we will need everyone on board moving in the same direction. We need to be bold, smart, innovative, wise, fair, inclusive and collaborative.”
“Let us be inspired by the wise Iroquoian principle that decisions we make today should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the future.”
“I am extending an open hand to invite each of you to join in the inquiry and demonstrate to all Canadians and our global neighbours our interest and commitment.”
From September to November 2019, Coyle made multiple flights for “business meetings.” She flew to St. John’s and made a trip to Ottawa when Parliament wasn’t in session.
Coyle has pushed Canadians to take responsibility for their actions to reduce greenhouse emissions.
On Feb. 12, she tweeted “Time to come together on a global green new deal.”
“Our children and grandchildren are already judging our inaction,” Coyle wrote on February 12. “As they witness the damage to the earth and live through catastrophic weather events in their own hometowns, they are telling our country’s leaders that our house is on fire and something urgently needs to be done.”
In the Feb. 6 statement, Coyle wrote, “What is needed is a willingness to be bold and take decisive action in every sector and every facet of Canadian life.”
“Action may not be easy and our path may not be linear, but we are far past the time for debate on the merits of action versus inaction. All Canadians can be leaders in this challenge of the millennium.”
“We the Senate of Canada have a tremendous opportunity to take a leadership role in examining and influencing action on the defining issue of this century, climate change.”
“We have a duty to serve the public good of all Canadians.”"

“As the world tackles a changing climate, nuclear power is poised to provide the next wave of clean, affordable, safe and reliable power,” said O’Regan, speaking at the annual Canadian Nuclear Association conference.
There were over 900 people in attendance at the conference, the largest in the industry. Held in Ottawa, there were dozens of major companies present as well as provincial cabinet minister from Saskatchewan and Ontario. Last December, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick signed a memorandum to work on small modular reactor technology together.
Small modular reactors was one of the main subjects of discussion because although those units produce less power than large generating stations, they can be constructed easier and are expected to operate more safely. Currently there are six proposed reactors being pushed through the regulatory process by Canadian firms, according to the National Post.
The long term goal would be to have the larger units replaced with a group of smaller units. The industry is also hoping to install units in rural or isolated communities, oilsands projects and mines which could potentially phase out diesel powered generators.
“We have been working so hard to support this industry. We are placing nuclear energy front and centre, something that has never been done before.” said O’Regan at the conference on Thursday.
“People need to know that it’s safe. They need to know that it’s regulated. They need to know that it’s safe for them,” he said.
The switch to small modular reactors would also help with the Liberal’s campaign promise that they would gradually reduce Canada’s carbon emissions. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he expects Canada to be carbon neutral by 2050.
How such a goal will be achieved is still unclear however, nuclear energy playing a major part is now being widely understood.
“I have not seen a credible plan for net zero without nuclear as part of the mix. I don’t think we are going to be relying on any one technology. I think it’s going to be a whole host of things.”
It will be countries on track to net zero emissions that will get the largest investors interested said O’Regan.
“Everybody has their shirt sleeves rolled up and we know we need to work on this, not only do we have to work on this for the urgency of the planet, but we have to work on it for Canadian jobs.”
He added, “We must focus on those areas where Canada can and should lead, like nuclear.”"

DART & Maru/Blue conducted a poll for the National Post and found that many Canadians at the moment agree with the following, “Right now, Canada is broken.” In fact 69 percent of Canadians across the country agree with that statement across the country and 83 percent agree with it in Alberta.
“This is one of the few polls that I just looked at — and I’ve been doing this for 30 years, so I did polling around the Oka Crisis — I was astonished when I saw some of these numbers, but I’m not surprised,” said John Wright, a partner with DART.
“A lot of the blame has been centred on the prime minister and the Liberal government,” said Daniel Béland, director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada.
The Liberals seem to be taking the brunt of the blame for the rail blockades with many feeling that Justin Trudeau is not leading the country in a positive direction, nor do they feel that Trudeau has come through on his signature promise to be the Prime Minister that stands up for Indigenous people. Two-thirds of Canadians feel he hasn’t fulfilled that pledge.
Beland believes that part of the reason for this is that when the blockades first started, Trudeau was out of the country, campaigning to have a seat on the United Nations Security Council which left Canadians feeling alienated from their leader.
“There was some form of void. The government left the impression — at least many people came to the conclusion — that there was no one really in charge of the situation,” said Béland.
As time has dragged on Canadians have only had less and less faith in the Prime Minister, with only 27 percent of Canadians who think Trudeau has handled the situation well. The premiers on the other hand had a higher, 45 percent approval rating for their handling of the issue.
Many Canadians themselves feel torn on the concerns of Indigenous people in Canada partly because of the Canadian government’s treatment of them throughout history. The poll showed that 57 percent of Canadians agree that “governments lie to Indigenous people about making things better for them.” More than half, 62 percent of Canadians believe Trudeau has not delivered on his promise to Indigenous people.
Canadians who were polled about the methods of the blockades as a form of protest disagreed with it by about 50 percent but said they would “stand with Indigenous people in solidarity” to help find another way to solve the issue. The other half of Canadians felt that “we’ve done enough for Indigenous people in Canada.”
When the poll asked Canadians if they would support a one-time payment issued immediately to Indigneous people for things like “food, clean water and housing.” two-thirds said they would support such a payment, even if it cost $1 billion.
The DART & Maru/Blue poll was conducted on Feb. 24 and used a sample selection of 1,511 random Canadians."

The shelter has provided trauma and outreach services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, incest, and sex trafficking since 1973. The funding was related to VRR’s Public Education and Community Outreach program.
The decision comes after an extended campaign by trans rights activists to have the City of Vancouver strip funding from the shelter in 2019, with some calling the rape crisis centre “transphobic.”
Please Don’t Let VRR or Anyone Use Public Funds to Teach and Reinforce Transphobia. https://t.co/Wiqjp3Fhig— Morgane Oger (@MorganeOgerBC) February 26, 2020
Speaking to The Post Millennial, Collective Member Karla Gjini emphasised that Vancouver Rape Relief was intended to be a safe space for women to share their experiences and advocate against male violence against women.
“[Our work is based around] women coming together and talking truthfully about their experiences with male violence to find common ground and understand they are not alone.” Gjini said, “It’s important to have that common ground and shared experience.”
Gjini also refuted the claims that Vancouver Rape Relief callously rejected trans-identified people who sought crisis services. Adrienne Smith, a Vancouver-area lawyer most notable for claiming Jessica Yaniv’s loss at the BCHRT was a “step backwards for trans rights,” claimed to have trans clients who had been turned away from VRR.
“If it were ever the case that a transwoman called us and there were no spaces anywhere — we would have to do something about that. But as far as I know, that has never happened.” Gjini said, noting that the safety of victims was VRR’s highest priority.
“We are always full. All the time. We have women and children stuffed to the brims, and unfortunately we have to turn away a lot of women because we do not have space to accommodate all of the women trying to escape the male violence they have experienced.”
The shelter’s stance to keep its space male-free has resulted in a barrage of hatred from trans rights activists, who have vandalised the rape relief’s building on multiple occasions.

In August of 2019, Vancouver Rape Relief’s storefront was spray painted with the words “KILL TERFS” and “TRANS POWER.” A dead, rotting rodent was nailed to the door.
The loss of funding at the behest of trans rights activists is not the first time the Vancouver Rape Relief shelter has been the target of radicals.
In 1995,  a transwoman named Kimberly Nixon sought to work at Vancouver Rape Relief as a councillor, but was denied on the basis of not having the lived experience as a woman. Nixon proceeded to take the shelter to the B.C Human Rights Tribunal, who awarded Nixon $7,500 in “discrimination” damages.
But after the Rape Relief shelter fought back, and the B.C Court of Appeals overturned the BCHRT’s decision, ultimately finding that they had “erred” in awarding Nixon costs. The Court of Appeals, and a subsequent B.C Supreme Court challenge both found that the Vancouver Rape Relief shelter were well within their rights to assemble freely as a women’s only space. The Supreme Court also ordered Nixon to pay the shelter’s legal fees.
Nixon has refused to acknowledge the court-ordered fees since the decision was made in 2009.
On what the future holds now that the shelter relies solely on donations, Karla Gjini is optimistic.
“We are going to continue to work the way that we do. We will find a way to continue offering what we do. We will just have to strategise a little bit.”"

Knight has been in the spotlight a number of times and participated in many interviews with CBC and Global News. She was even arrested in 2016 for occupying a building that was to be demolished in BC.

The Canadian Museum for Human Rights, the local RCMP Headquarters and Liberal MP Dan Vandal’s office. All of the messages were pointed towards the ongoing protests of the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline.
Liberal MP Dan Vandal’s office had the phrases “Stolen land,” “Shut down KKKanada” and “land back” all written in graffiti .
The RCMP monument dedicated to mounties who’d died in the line of duty was also vandalized with the words “F–k RCMP”. The monument is located outside the RCMP “D” Division headquarters on Portage Avenue.
The monument was erected in 1998 and cost $100,000, of the money was raised through fundraising and by employee donations.
RCMP spokesperson, Sgt. Paul Manaigre described the general reaction of the officers as shocked after seeing the defaced monument. “Anger sets in afterwards,” he said.
“We understand … if you want to send a message. But I’m not sure why you would want to target a monument that honours those that gave their lives for the people in this province.”
Today, our beloved monument honouring #rcmpmb officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty, was vandalized.

“It’s upsetting,” he said.
All three acts of vandalism are being investigated as related incidents according to Winnipeg police spokesman Rob Carver. Winnipeg police will be taking on the case with the help of security footage provided by the RCMP. Carver has yet to name any suspects in the case, according to CBC.
The vandalism could potentially be a response to the 10 protestors arrested near Belleville, Ont. on Monday at a rail blockade.

“I do know the group Indigenous Youth and Allies for Wet’suwet’en only [acts] out of a place of peace and love for the land and land protectors,” wrote a member of the Winnipeg group that supports the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs.
The Canadian Museum for Human Rights had the question, “Is this the future you want?” graffitied on the wall in red paint.
“To be honest, my first instinct was a little of blood boils,” he said. “But our mandate is to cultivate reflection, and as we think about it, I think this is a reflection of a very important conversation that is going on in Canada,” said John Young, the museum’s chief executive officer.
“This is something that we need to wrestle with better as Canadians, the realities of colonization,” he said.
“I don’t condone graffiti, but I think … we need to recognize this is an effort to make expression.”
Graffiti painted on Liberal MP Vandal’s office read, “stolen land,” “U fail us” and “do better.” Vandal is the federal minister of Northern Affairs.
“It’s disappointing when that happens, because the way out of this issue is through dialogue — not vandalizing something or violence,” he said. Vandal is also the minister of Northern Affairs. “We need to talk to one another, and we need to set the right stage and the right table for that.”
President of the Manitoba Metis Federation, David Chartrand, said in a written statement that he was saddened by the graffiti although not surprised.
“I challenge the people who did this, to think how they would feel if someone broke into a graveyard at night and did this to a relative’s headstone or gravesite,” he wrote.
“People who commit violent acts and vandalize property will never represent nor receive support from the Métis Nation or other democratically elected Indigenous governments.”"

The obstructions were placed there by a second protest group of Tyendinaga Mohawk demonstrators, according to the Ottawa Citizen.
The protestors could be seen carrying different debris to the tracks where a burning tire was placed on Monday. The OPP showed up to the scene to attempt to get the situation under control.
It is still unknown whether any of the protestors involved in the second camp were charged or taken into custody by police.
The Lennox and Addington OPP charged ten protestors from the first location with resisting arrest, disobeying a court order and mischief of over $5,000. A court date for March 24 has been set for the demonstrators who were charged.
An open letter was issued to Justin Trudeau by Amnesty International which was added to its website on Tuesday. According to the organization, they went to see the protestors shortly after their arrests on Monday.
In the letter, secretary general Alex Neve wrote “visited Tyendinaga today, in the aftermath of the Ontario Provincial Police’s enforcement action which has reportedly resulted in the arrest of 10 protesters.”
“It was notable to us that all community members we spoke with described a feeling of betrayal and broken trust, particularly given the dialogue that had begun with Minister Miller on February 15th, reiterated in his assurance to Tyendinaga leadership the following day, in his letter of February 16th, that he ‘welcome[s] the invitation to talk again in the near future to continue our open and respectful dialogue.’”
Neve told Prime Minister Trudeau, “we appreciated the restraint that your government demonstrated in the initial phases of the blockades” adding the “call for patience is particularly inappropriate with respect to the Wet’suwet’en people, who have waited for 23 years for their land rights to be recognized following the groundbreaking 1997 Supreme Court of Canada Delgamuukw decision; and for the Tyendinga Mohawks who have waited for over 170 years for the return of their lands taken as part of the Culbertson Tract.”
“While your government did initially show remarkable restraint, you have of course in the end given a nod to enforcement action, which is now being pursued by national, provincial and municipal police forces across the country. That enforcement will not bring resolution to the deep concerns that underlie these rights struggles and protests.”
Amnesty asked Prime Minister Trudeau to “ensure that land defenders are not criminalized and that people who have been arrested for defending the land and who have not engaged in acts of criminal violence are released unconditionally.”
He also requested that Trudeau “engage directly and personally in discussions with Indigenous chiefs, elected and hereditary, so as to demonstrate that you recognize that these are not simply matters of barricades and law enforcement, but are the very essence of a respectful and rights regarding nation-to-nation relationship.”"

Propane and feed transportation is also being disrupted, which paired with lost sales is costing producers millions.
According to the Financial Post, shipments of grain to Canadian ports are down by 1.2 million tonnes. The worst of the losses have occurred this month after blockades were started in opposition to the Coastal GasLink pipeline construction in northern BC.
Mark Hemmes, the president of Quorum Corp. noted that in the past month, grain deliveries to ships have dropped by around 560,000 tonnes as they are unable to reach their destination due to the barriers.
“At some point in time, we might make this up but it’ll be way into the summer before we do,” Hemmes said. “Everybody in this business right now, they’ve had their confidence shattered and the impact of that stretches well beyond our borders. We’re going to have to work hard to win back the confidence of our buyers.”
The Western Grain Elevator Association has estimated that demurrage costs, contract penalties and capacity losses have contributed to approximately $63 million per week.
In Vancouver and Prince Rupert alone, there are 52 ships waiting to be loaded. As some blockades were removed on Tuesday, some grain was able to be transported to the ports. According to Mary Robinson, the president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the ships waiting at the ports charge fees for every day that they have to wait which adds even more pressure to the situation.
On Tuesday at an annual meeting for the association in Ottawa, Robinson said, “These extra costs will not be paid by ports or rail companies. They come directly out of farmers’ pockets at a cash-pressed time when we need to prepare and invest for the coming crop year.”
Hemmes noted that grain elevators located in western Canada are currently at 90 percent capacity.
“If the grain elevators run out of room and they can’t deliver it, the farmers can’t get paid,” he said. “That’s what’s so frustrating about this. There has to be a balance between empty and loaded cars moving through the country and that is not happening now.”
Gary Stordy, the director of government and corporate affairs for the Canadian pork council noted that pork producers are suffering as well. He said that with trucks being the only available mode of transportation, storage room is running low. He added that transporting pork with trucks costs approximately three times as much as by rail.
“The trucking companies are overwhelmed too, and it’s slowing everything,” said Stordy. “Everybody’s getting really concerned. This is getting more and more difficult.”
These issues have come about just as Beijing put an end to a suspension on Canadian meat that has lasted for four months. Demand is expected to increase for the market.
“All of this is happening at an unexpected additional cost for farmers and it’s starting to get serious,” noted Stordy."

A train was stopped for a brief period of time close to Belleville, Ontario, when protestors started throwing snowballs towards the train cars. They also tried to start a fire on the track where tires had previously been burnt by protestors.
Bill Dickenson, an Ontario Provincial Police spokesman said, “It’s a little bit of a tense situation right now in terms of how CN goes in to check out the tracks. The big issue is CN’s trying to roll the trains but having tires burning on the tracks is definitely an issue.”
Three trains were able to pass as 20 police officers were situated at the tracks with more overlooking the situation from an overpass. Around 20 Mohawk protestors are still at the tracks on the south side, while police remain on the north side.
These were some of the first freight trains to pass through the area since a Tyendinaga Mohawk blockade was removed by police on Monday. Ten protestors were charged during the incident.
The arrests seemingly sparked more protests across the country, including some in the GTA.
The Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory blockades have done most of the damage to the economy by cutting off CN and Via Rail’s service in eastern Canada.
The Tyendinaga protest started on Feb. 6 to show support for the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs who are against the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern BC.
CN had to temporarily stop their service to eastern Canada on Feb. 14, forcing the company to lay off approximately 450 employees.
Via Rail was forced to lay off close to 1,000 people as they use some of the same tracks as CN. The company’s trains are still suspended east of Toronto."

The group is expected to address the public today.
The Indigenous Youth for Wet’suwet’en released a statement saying, “address why reconciliation is dead, and what they plan to do to facilitate immediate provincial and federal action.”
The group of protestors have been showing their support for Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs who are against the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern BC.
Among other things, the group is planning to voice their opposition against court injunctions being used to remove protestors from an area of pipeline construction close to Houston, BC.
On Monday, the protestors clashed with police as they charged the buildings entrance. They asked fellow supporters to bring supplies to the building such as tents, blankets, headlamps, propane and water jugs.
An injunction was won by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of BC on Feb. 13. The injunction prevents people from blocking doorways as well as driveways of the BC legislature. The BC Supreme Court granted the injunction which also does not allow activists to interfere with staff, security or workers on the grounds.
The protestors are allowed to be on the grounds as long as they are not breaking these rules."

Harper responded to the tweet saying, “Not afraid at all, just bored by mediocre comedy. Come on, make a joke that is funny. You get billions and you can’t make one funny joke.”
This comes just weeks after Conservative leadership candidate Erin O’Toole pledged to privatize the broadcasting company.
When previouslyinterviewed by The Post Millennial, O’Toole said, “We’re announcing today a plan to radically reform and energize the CBC. That will mean cutting CBC digital. That will mean eliminating half the budget of CBC English television—with a view of privatizing it over the course of a four-year government.”

The same report showed that advertising revenue has also dropped 21 percent overall. From 2018 to 2019 its revenues went down from $318.2 million to $248.7 million despite heavy funding from the Canadian government."

With the introduction of Bill 1, the Critical Infrastructure Defence Act, police and prosecutors would have the ability to enforce more provincial penalties.
“Apparently those disincentives haven’t been strong enough for some people,” said Jason Kenney. “Albertans and Canadians respect our constitutionally protected freedoms of expression, of assembly, and to protest but blocking railways, roadways, and commuter trains and critical infrastructure is simply and plainly illegal.”
Kenney again suggested that Sunday’s withdrawal of the Teck Frontier mine was partly caused by protestors against the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern BC.
“If this carries on it will have devastating impacts on our economy here in Alberta and in the rest of the country. Albertans will not tolerate this kind of lawless mockery of our democratic principles and this attack on our nations and our province’s prosperity,” he said.
Bill 1 adds to the legislation introduced by the UCP in the fall which heightens maximum trespassing penalties.
If the Bill passes it would introduce larger fines as well as prison terms reaching up to six months. Bill 1 would also introduce fines that could be added on to initial fines each day that protests continue.
Some of the “essential infrastructure” that the bill would apply to includes oil and gas sites, water utilities and dams and telephone lines.
Justice minister Doug Schweitzer said, “Each day that (this) goes on, it would be a new offence, so the fines would compound over time … We want to send a clear signal that this will not be tolerated.”
Initial fines would begin at $1,000 and reach up to $25,000 by just the second day of a blockade. Corporations that aid or direct blockades could see fines as large as $200,000.
Schweitzer noted that the onsite police would have to power to decide whether or not the law would be applied to these protests.
The bill was criticized by NDP leader, Rachel Notley who said that the bill could potentially be used to shut down other types of protests that the government disagrees with such as teacher’s protests.
“Bill 1 should have been completely focused on jobs, and as we know when it comes to protesters that this premier claims to be concerned about, the law already prohibited that kind of work and the law already allowed for them to be arrested,” Notley said.
Schweitzer told the federal government to follow their lead and take a similar approach with their legislative action."

Teksavvy claims the telecommunications companies used their dominant positions to take advantage of the wholesale market and jack up prices. Through their internet brands Virgin and Fido, the companies were able to offer retail prices below the wholesale prices which allowed them to exclude any other retail competitors. The complaint also sought an inquiry and enforcement action from the federal commissioner.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunication Commission found that Bell and Rogers had violated rate-setting rules more than 50 times between 2016-2019 with rates being inflated sometime as much as 900 percent. The two companies were ordered to correct the inflated rates and to repay the the amounts unjustly taken from competitors in 2019.
ADs
Bell and Rogers managed to be successful in staying execution of the order. The two companies argued in their appeal that its enforcement would have been too damaging to their businesses according to Canadian Lawyer Magazine.
TekSavvy alleged that such anti-competitive conduct has resulted in many problematic consequences for Canadians such as higher retail prices than other countries; the exit of wholesale-based competitors such as the complainants themselves from competing in retail internet markets; and discouraging other new competitors from entering mobile markets. The complaint argued that Bell and Rogers were guilty through the the Competition Act, RSC 1985, c C-34 under all three requisites of s. 79(1).
Together, the companies jointly dominated the wholesale market and retail markets to exclude other competitors.
ADs
More than 150,000 Canadians have called for the CRTC to enforce an order and for the federal cabinet to take action against Bell and Rogers to reduce mobile and internet costs according to a TekSavvy news release.
“These kind of anti-competitive activities are the reason why Canadians pay among the very highest prices for Internet and Mobile services in the world,”  said TekSavvy’s vice-president for consumer legal affairs.
The Post Millennial previously reported that Canadians are finding ways to avoid expensive Canadian phone plans by getting American plans instead.

He says he is worried about how it will affect driving, mental health and young people according to Vice.
During an interview with the Kelowna Daily Courier MacKay said that he believes the legalization of marijuana was “forced” and it should only have been decriminalized.
“It should have been decriminalized and that’s where our government was heading on the advice of the Canadian Police Association and chiefs of police. Bringing in a phased-way with decriminalization would have been far preferable. What I most worry about is the impact on young people, the mental health implications, the impaired driving implications,” said MacKay.
ADs
Stats Canada released information that conflicts with some of MacKay’s views. The statistics show that consumption of marijuana in 15-17-year-olds has dropped 10 percent since its legalization.
MacKay described the legalization as a “back-of-a-napkin promise that the current prime minister had made.”
He also called the attempt by the government to reduce black market sales a “complete failure.”
ADs
“I believe we have jumped the shark on that issue. More emphasis on protecting people from other drugs, fentanyl and oxycontin has to be part of any plan that’s there for public health reasons.” MacKay continued.
“The promise that it (legalization) was going to reduce the black market has been a complete failure. There’s now simply more marijuana available to more people, including young people. I don’t think that’s the most productive and highest priority that a government could pursue.”
MacKay is not the only politician against cannabis legalization. Former Conservative MP Julian Fantino compared legalization to murder in an old interview with the Toronto Sun, Fantino said, “I guess we can legalize murder, too, and then we won’t have a murder case”

In 2015, Fantino said he was still “completely opposed to legalization of marijuana”"

The protests continue with new blockades as anti-pipeline protestors halt the transportation of goods and people in an attempt to shut down the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline that will cross through territory belonging to the Wet’suwet’en people.
The two rail rivals decided to work together after some quiet talks brokered by a government desperate to dampen the growing economic threat caused by the protestors according to CN and government sources.
Ontario Provincial Police arrested 10 of the demonstrators on Monday in order to get service back up and running on the line near Belleville, Ont.
CN trains are bypassing the blockades using alternate routes, travelling through the U.S. to continue deliveries to Quebec and the Maritimes. Communities in those provinces are facing shortages of essential goods such as propane for heating and chemicals for water treatment facilities.
The deal was negotiated by Transport Minister Marc Garneau’s office, Transport Canada, CN Rail and Canada Pacific all in private out of fears that more blockades would be set up in response according to CBC.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alluded to the CN/CP side deal en route to question period in the House of Commons yesterday saying, “Over the past number of days we’ve been working with rail carriers to ensure that many trains continue to use alternate routes to get through and that’s one of the reasons we’ve been able to avoid some of the most serious shortages,” said Trudeau.
The Retail Council of Canada’s senior vice president, Karl Littler, commented after hearing of the news, “We’re talking about foods, we’re talking about fuel to keep people heating in what can be a cold winter,” said Littler.
“You’re talking about a lot of stuff that Canadians need everyday. I think it’s the responsible thing to look to see what alternative channels exist and if that means collaboration in these circumstances, so much the better.”"

The blockades are in protest of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in BC. The poll was conducted by Ipsos between Feb. 21 and Feb. 24 and surveyed 1300 Canadians over the age of 18.
The protestors involved in the blockades claim to be in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs who are against the construction of the natural gas pipeline. The blockades began in BC and have spread throughout the country blocking main rail lines and ports.
The amount of Canadians against the pipeline has risen in comparison with results of a similar poll released by Ipsos last week. The poll also suggests that people who were previously on the fence about the issue are beginning to side against the protests and are supporting police intervention.
The poll shows that 63 percent of respondents support police intervention in main transportation corridors—up 10 points from last week. On the other hand, 26 percent of people are in opposition of police intervention which is down two points. Results show that 11 percent of respondents are unsure.
According to the poll, 60 percent of respondents are against the blockades with 35 percent very, and 25 percent somewhat against them. These numbers are up 11 points since last week. The poll shows that 27 percent of people are in support of the blockades with 11 percent very, and 17 percent somewhat in support. This shows a decrease of 5 points from last week’s poll. Results also show that 13 percent of respondents are unsure, which is a drop of seven points from last week.
Manitoba and Saskatchewan residents are most against the blockades at 71 percent while 63 percent of Alberta, 60 percent of Quebec, 59 percent of Atlantic Canada and 57 percent of Ontario residents are against them."
0,2020-02-24T05:07:48.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/the-trudeau-government-wont-release-information-gender-research-why,The Trudeau government won’t release information gender research—why?,"When Bill C16 passed in 2017, many women rang the alarm against legislation that would amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include protection against hate speech with regard to gender identity or expression. Concerns about the Bill were that gender identity protections would supercede protections for women. While there was a promise that a gender-based analysis (GBA) report would be forthcoming, it has not been released. That’s not good enough for Jennifer Joseph, who has launched a petition for the release of this information.
“We, the undersigned, Citizens of Canada,” resolves the petition, “call upon Candice Bergen to ask for the Gender-Based Analysis report be made public, and for Statistics Canada to explain their analysis or publish the results.”
Women who voiced concerns back in 2017 were not listened to and were accused of transphobic hate speech for broaching concerns about Bill C16. Yet much of what they predicted has come to pass. Women who speak out against having male-bodied persons in women’s spaces are called names, ostracized, and shut out of those places themselves.
In 2018, Kristi Hanna left a Toronto shelter for abused women rather than share a room with a male-bodied trans person. Her complaints were unheeded by staff. Vancouver Rape Relief, Canada’s oldest rape crisis centre, was denied funding by the City for not being inclusive enough to male-bodied trans persons. A human rights complaint was filed by Kimberly Nixon in 1995 against the center for the refusal to train Nixon, born male, to become a peer counsellor. Vancouver Rape Relief did not believe that Nixon could be a peer counsellor to other women, because Nixon was not born female. A rape relief center did not want women who had been raped to have to be counselled by a male person, so they lost their funding entirely.
The case of Jessica Yaniv, who has brought multiple complaints before the Human Rights Tribunal, accusing women of being hateful for not wanting to wax her male genitalia, shows how absurd this entire thing has become. Women’s rights to determine the work they would do in their private homes were questioned under Bill C16.
The petition states that police departments across Canada are no longer recording the sex of alleged offenders, “but instead the gender by which they identify.” The reasoning is that a person’s sex is too personal, and irrelevant to the charge of a crime committed. It is reasonable to consider that this change is to avoid running afoul of Human Rights legislation. Problems with this new practice include the confusion of crime stats, which then record crimes committed by male-bodied female-identifying persons as women’s crimes.
The Bill also interferes with parental rights, forcing parents to go along with their minor children’s ideas about medical alterations to their healthy bodies.
""For the past 11 months, Robert Hoogland, a father in Surrey, British Columbia, has been forced to watch as his 14-year-old daughter was “destroyed and sterilized” by court-ordered testosterone injections.""https://t.co/WXVdC2RoTX— James Shupe (Formerly Jamie Shupe) (@NotableDesister) February 21, 2020
Perhaps the biggest problem with Bill C16 is the one that is most readily dismissed by trans activists. Bill C16 seeks to rewrite protections for women by removing the definition of the word. This denial of a biological definition of the word woman is what has allowed women to be brought up on charges of human rights abuses when they define the word to exclude persons who are born male.
Bill C16 offers protected classes for “gender identity” and “gender expression,” which terms are not legally defined. This defacto changes the meaning of the word woman to “whatever if feels like” to any given individual. In essence, this has meant that a person who dresses up as stereotypically feminine can say they are a woman, and gain access to those protections, such as abused women’s refuges, rape crisis centres, women’s prisons, and women’s hospital wards, that have previously been designated for the care of women.
This is done out of compassion for the individual who identifies more with those stereotypes that are associated with the opposite sex than with their own, but in doing so, it offers no consideration for women who need spaces and protections that male-bodied persons, no matter their fashion choices, do not. This petition seeks redress of these grievances by obtaining information on the effects of the law and is open for signatures until April."

If you’ve been convicted of a crime, and you have paid your debt to society, you cannot be reconvicted of the exact same crime.
Of course, this guaranteed right only applies to such crimes in the Criminal Code as murder, rape or kidnapping. For thought crimes, there are no such guarantees. When it comes to thought crimes, we have yet to discover the upward limit for the jeopardies that may be imposed.
A double-jeopardy fix seems to be in for Lynn Beyek, appointed to the Senate by Stephen Harper in 2013. From the heavily mixed Indigenous/non-Indigenous northern area of Dryden, Ontario, Sen Beyek is presently a non-affiliated senator. A Senate committee is poised to decree next week that even though Sen Beyek fulfilled the requirements of her penalty for an initial thought crime, she is deemed insufficiently … re-educated, let us say, and must, therefore, suffer further, much more punitive retribution.
ADs
It is quite possible, even probable, that Sen Beyak, removed from the Conservative caucus in early 2018, and suspended without pay from Senate duties for several months in 2019, will now be suspended again without pay for the duration of this parliament, and forced to undergo further re-education concerning her problematic beliefs.
If that happens, many of her colleagues will be glad to have this thorn in their side out of sight and out of mind for several years (barring a successful no-confidence vote in this minority government). But others—the supporters who share her convictions (and she has a few senate colleagues who do; whether they will say so publicly we’ll know in due course), as well as those who do not share her views, but do support her right to hold them —will believe a great injustice has been done.
What are Sen Beyak’s thought crimes, which used to be posted on her website, but are no longer there? Well, for one thing, she believes status Indigenous peoples should integrate fully into Canadian society. As she wrote in an open letter on Sept 1, 2017, quoted in a CBC report, “None of us are leaving, so let’s stop the guilt and blame and find a way to live together and share. All Canadians are then free to preserve their cultures in their own communities, on their own time, with their own dime.”

Sen Beyak expressed approval of Pierre Trudeau’s 1969 White Paper on Indigenous issues, produced in collaboration with Jean Chrétien as Indian Affairs Minister, which proposed doing away with the Indian Act and treaties and eliminating a distinct legal Indian status. Sen Beyak said she felt they “got it right.” Trudeau had proposed an end to the Indian Act, with a fair, one-time settlement for individual natives, in exchange for the financial (not historical) portion of the treaties and land claims. Sen Beyak is in agreement with Pierre Trudeau’s statement, “We could mount pressure groups across this country on many areas where there have been historic wrongs. I do not think it is the purpose of a government to right the past. It cannot re-write history. It is our purpose to be just in our time.”
Sen Beyak at this point was already in trouble for remarks in the Red Chamber considered even more heretical back in March 2017, when she criticized the Truth and Reconciliation Report for its failure of balance in its indictment of the residential school system (while conceding that there was some representation at the TRC by former residential-school students who recounted positive experiences). “I speak partly for the record, but mostly in memory of the kindly and well-intentioned men and women and their descendants—perhaps some of us here in this chamber—whose remarkable works, good deeds and historical tales in the residential schools go unacknowledged for the most part,” she said.
Sen Beyek was mocked by politicians from all parties as “ignorant” and her “hate speech” was denounced by all the liberal media. She was removed from the Senate Aboriginal Peoples Committee by interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose, after four years of uncontroversial service on it, and calls for her resignation filled the air.

In Sept, 2017, Sen Beyak questioned the wisdom of the government’s decision to create a second costly Indigenous ministry. The media trashed her for it, erroneously implying in one case that Sen Beyek was not aware that Indigenous peoples were citizens of Canada.
Compounding her alleged wickedness were controversial letters sent from supporters of Sen Beyek’s heterodox views, which she posted on her website, and refused to take down when ordered to be by Senate Ethics Officer (SEO) Pierre Legault. Some of the comments in them were indeed offensive – Sen Beyek called them “edgy and opinionated” – and even Sen Beyak’s defenders would say she showed poor judgment in choosing such a small hill to die on, so to speak.
One letter, for example, suggested that if only people on reserves had the work ethic of the Amish, their homes would be well-constructed and safe, their resources up to standard and their communities economically self-sustaining. The latter was considered an example of “overt racism” by a Walrus writer, who accused some of Sen Beyak’s supporters of expressing “white-supremacist sentiments.”
ADs
I find such language misleading, erroneous and quite over the top. The letter is pointing to the tragic consequences of the “learned helplessness” that is a feature of many reserves. It has been referenced time and time again by credible, sympathetic mainstream writers. The writer’s impatience with the ongoing dysfunction on these reserves may present itself in an uncomfortably blunt manner, but it most certainly does not rise to the level of hate speech. (Which doesn’t mean some of the “edgy and opinionated” letters are a good look on a senator’s tax-funded website.)
Sen Beyak is likely more naïve than a willful provocateur, but in pushing back against what she considers the sanctification of native suffering, she often shoots herself in the foot. In resisting the tendency of progressives to label everything they don’t like “racist,” she said in an interview with Legault, “In my view, there is no racism in Canada. Right now there are groups putting people into silos, trying to divide us, by saying that we have racism against violence, we have racism against Indigenous people, Ukrainian, white privilege—I find those people racist. Those who seek to divide us are the racists. The rest of us are Canadians. We all bleed the same colour, we all live together in peace and harmony. That’s the way Canada is supposed to be.”
(Most of what Sen Beyak says here is fair comment. Unfortunately, how many Canadians will get past the words “there is no racism in Canada” without a sharp intake of breath—even those who believe the most fervently in freedom of speech? It certainly doesn’t help Sen Beyak’s case that she is a born-again Christian with all the politically incorrect views that implies.)
ADs
In January 2018, Sen Beyak learned from a press release that she had been removed from the Conservative caucus. The press release states that “Senator Beyek admitted to posting racist letters on her website and refused to take them down when I asked her to.” Sen Beyak denied that any formal request had been made to remove the letters, and categorically denied that she was a racist or would ever “admit” that she was racist. Her website was frozen.
By alluding to Sen Beyak as a racist, Scheer opened the door for a senate inquiry request, which emerged four days after his press release. The Ethics Office report gathered snippets from the letters, some out of context and painted them in toto as referring to Indigenous people as “opportunistic, pampered whiners who are milking the government and exploiting the taxpayer.” None of the letters actually say that, but that is the impression given by the report.
On Feb 27, 2019 Sen Beyak was presented with the SEO’s preliminary report. Not included: letters from Indigenous women – one a chief – supporting Sen Beyak’s position, or any other of the hundreds of non-racist letters vigorously supportive of Sen Beyak’s views. Also omitted were declarations from journalists and academics who had read all the letters, and who found nothing racist in them, lauding Sen Beyak as well informed and objective on Indigenous issues.
ADs
Former Manitoba provincial court judge and journalist Brian Giesbrecht for example, wrote in an April 2019 Frontier Centre for Public Policy blog post: “As far as the posted letters, the great majority provide thoughtful comments from people who have thought long and hard about the highly complex and vexing Indigenous situation.  While a few of the more awkwardly worded letters could best have been omitted, the notion that the senator’s website is teeming with hatred and racism is preposterous.” He asks and answers: “So, what is the senator’s real crime – a crime deemed so egregious that she must be humiliated, shunned, and even financially damaged and hounded out of public office?  Her ‘crime’ is refusing to go along with the politically correct version of the prevailing orthodoxy pertaining to Indigenous issues.”
On April 30th the Ethics Committee presented their harshly critical report on Sen Beyek to the Senate. It concluded that by “refusing to recognize the cultural oppression imposed by the residential School System, and the discriminatory objectives of the Indian Act, Senator Beyak appears to deny a historical truth and displays conduct that ignores its racist underpinnings.”
ADs
Sen Beyak was directed to take an online course given by Indigenous Awareness Canada, entitled “201 Indigenous Certification.” The goal of the course was “to build effective and positive relationships with Indigenous people,” focusing on “racism towards Indigenous Peoples, Residential Schools, Chronology and Current realities.” Ms Beyak completed the course and received a suitable-for-framing “Indigenous Awareness” Certificate.
Next, the Senate retained the federally funded ($6,888,000 in 2019) Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres (OFIFC) in Toronto to provide Sen Beyak with “cultural competency Training.” Interestingly their website describes their mission as one of service to Indigenous people in urban communities. It makes no mention of cultural competency training for non-Indigenous. Anyway, there were to be three “training cycles,” undertaken at Sen Beyak’s own expense, at OFIFC’s Toronto office, a four-hour drive from her home, on separate occasions in June and August.
Sen Beyak took the first of them last June 6th as planned, in a group setting. Cycles two and three were mutually arranged for Aug 26 and 27. When Sen Beyak arrived on Aug 26, she was taken to the training director’s office and told that training was no longer available to her. Sen Beyak reported their refusal to the SEO, who replied that he had no communication to that effect from the OFIFC. Repeated requests from Sen Beyek to the OFIFC for an explanation went unanswered.
ADs
Nevertheless, in Sept, 2019, Liberal Senator Peter Harder, a senior bureaucrat in previous Liberal governments, sent an email to Canadian Press columnist Joan Bryden, falsely stating that “Senator Beyek has so far refused to follow through on the Senate’s recommendations for remedial measures.” On Sept 24, Bryden perpetuated the falsehood in The Toronto Star that “Senator Beyek refused to take sensitivity training.”
On parting from the OFIFC after the first session, Sen Beyek told her sensitivity trainer, “We would have to agree to disagree.” Disagree with the only “correct” understanding of “reconciliation”? How puzzling and disconcerting this statement must have seemed to the trainer. That was probably the first and only time anyone sent in for sensitivity training had dared to state that in spite of paying respectful attention to the course material, she had not changed her mind.
It seems clear that the OFIFC felt Sen Beyek was a lost cause, and simply abandoned her as they felt she could not be re-educated. One staffer claimed Sen Beyek had made the environment “unsafe” by claiming to identify as Métis on the grounds that she has an adopted sister of Métis provenance. Sen Beyek vigorously denies she made any such claim. Under normal circumstances it would be her word against the word of the staffer. But the SEO and the media seemed to feel such a gaffe was par for the course, and bought it without interrogation. A CBC reporter wrote:  “she told her instructors she was Métis because her parents had adopted an Indigenous child.” That should have been “she allegedly told her instructors…”
ADs
The knives are out for Sen Beyek—too many, I fear, for her to avoid more drawn blood.
Sen Beyek has never had a fair trial. Racism, the word at the centre of the storm, has never been formally defined or debated throughout this process. The word “reconciliation” has become a cudgel to force everyone in public life to toe the line on what is acceptable and what is not acceptable to say regarding Indigenous policy. Sen Beyek may speak her mind in a more unfiltered way than we are used to these days, but is that the fault of her words, or the fact that the rest of our politicians have learned the art of self-censorship so well that it is her candour alone, rather than the content of her discourse, that startles and offends?
ADs
I couldn’t help but think of Sen Beyek’s case as a macro example of what happened to Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer in a micro way when he recently spoke out in favour of law enforcement to deal with illegal Indigenous and environment activist blockaders. He was “de-platformed” from an all-leaders’ meeting with the PM. Why? Because, Trudeau said, Scheer had “disqualified” himself in having  shown a  “deliberate misunderstanding of reconciliation.”
If Andrew Scheer is disqualified from attending a party leaders’ meeting with the PM because he failed to understand the meaning of reconciliation, then I guess I don’t understand the meaning of reconciliation either. And I guess millions of others don’t understand it as well, because that’s how many of us are in Andrew Scheer’s lane on the blockades.
And it may likewise be that millions of Canadians agree with Sen Beyek’s perspective on Indigenous relations with their fellow Canadians, including some Indigenous people. If the Senate is bent on humiliating Sen Beyek for her alleged failure to understand reconciliation, then what does the word really mean? Reconciliation is supposed to bring people together. Instead, every time someone who embraces a heterodox view of the word is punished for speaking his or her mind, it drives us apart.
ADs
Furthermore, it is not up to the Senate to declare that Sen Beyek does not understand “historic truths.” Nobody knows what historic truths are while they are living through them. In a hundred years, if the reserves are exactly as they are today, our grandchildren may well say that Sen Beyek had a more coherent vision of historic truth than Justin Trudeau and his white-privilege-intersectionality minions.
Meanwhile, let us stop calling the sessions Sen Beyek attended “sensitivity training” or “reconciliation” sessions. If someone directed to take them cannot attend and listen in good faith and still disagree with what he or she has heard without undergoing double jeopardy and a “disappearance” from public life, then let us call them what they are: maoist re-education sessions.
Sen Beyek is no racist, any more than Jean Chrétien and Pierre Elliott Trudeau were. She has a right to hold opinions that beat against the current of conventional assumptions. Let her colleagues debate her if they don’t like her ideas. Instead, they have invited “cancel culture” into the Senate of Canada. What a dismal piece of political theatre we are witnessing, and one more giant nail in the coffin of freedom of speech.

George is both a band member and part of the hereditary system. She also previously helped translate a major Supreme Court decision that gave greater control to Indigenous communities over their land.
She says she is opposed to the blockades that have been set up throughout the country according to an interview with the Globe and Mail.
“I want the world to know what’s been happening to us. We are being bullied, it’s so shameful, so hurtful. We are being humiliated.” said George.
George was only a young woman when she was selected by her community for a Wet’suwet’en leadership role. A role that George says she knew she would be fulfilling for the rest of her life.
George was initially very apprehensive about speaking out against what is happening in her community. She didn’t want to cause any further pain surrounding this issue however she said she feels it is also important that the truth be told.
“I want the world to know why I am stepping forward as a matriarch,” spoke George at the Pleasant Valley Cafe in Houston, B.C. “The world thinks the matriarchs are behind all the protests going on and that’s not true. None of the matriarchs were contacted.”
“There is no love, there is no respect. That’s not the way of our ancestors,” Ms. George said, saying she is speaking on behalf of the matriarchs and elders of her community. “If I keep quiet, if I don’t come forward to address our point of view, it will look like we are supporters. We are not.”
George expressed having great difficulty speaking out against some of her own and the unaffiliated anti-pipeline protestors who have turned her community into a battleground over issues of climate change policy. She said even the elders are afraid to voice their concerns.
Ms. George said the current influx of outside protesters who are pushing their own agenda via her community has muddled the exchange of opinions within the Wet’suwet’en community. Instead, George feels it would be much more appropriate if the Wet’suwet’en community had time and the privacy to discuss this important issue.
“It hurts me to see them [pipeline opponents] wearing regalia in the snow and mud and marching in the cities. That’s not right. That’s affecting all of us. Our ancestors would say they are dirtying the names and the regalia.”"

Conservative Party leadership candidate Erin O’Toole recently called for the privatization of the publicly funded TV service.
CBC’s potential new “Oh” marketing campaign is reminiscent of the network’s earlier attempts to boost sales with previous trademarks such as“Fall for CBC” in 2014, “Canada’s Own” in 2011, and “Trusted, Connected, Canadian” in 2001.
In 2013 the public broadcaster sued a Montréal cable station for $50,000 over the trademark “Ici” (“here”) which they used for their French-language service according to Blacklock’s Reporter.
“Our public broadcaster is stuck in the past,” said O’Toole in a campaign video on February 14. “An O’Toole government will modernize and reform the CBC,” said O’Toole. “We will end funding for CBC digital and we will cut the CBC English TV budget by fifty percent. Our plan will phase out TV advertising with a goal to fully privatize CBC English TV by the end of our first mandate.”
The CBC receives $1.2 billion grant per year from the government, however, their English-language television ad revenues fell 37 percent last year.
O’Toole said he would keep CBC French-language services and the Crown broadcaster’s national radio network as it is.
In 2017 a Conservative bill to privatize the CBC as an entire corporation was brought forth but was defeated.
Former Conservative MP Brad Trost was a sponsor of the bill, “The Mulroney administration philosophically should have done it, just as the previous Harper administration philosophically should have been prepared to privatize the CBC,” said Trost, in an interview at the time. “Someone needed to take the first steps to get things going.”
“The late former finance minister Jim Flaherty actually broached this subject a few times in the past,” said Trost. “He spoke to me about how it was one of his wishes to privatize the CBC. Jim and I discussed it.”
Bill C-308 An Act To Provide For The Incorporation Of The CBC would have reorganized the network under the Canada Business Corporations Act with plans to have a final sale within the following three years. The bill was shot down in the Commons by a vote of 260 to 6."

The birds may now have another reason to be disliked as they’ve been spotted donning MAGA hats.
A group calling itself P.U.T.I.N. which stands for Pigeons United To Interfere Now has claimed ownership for the pro-Trump publicity stunt. They glued MAGA hats onto the heads of pigeons and then released them to fly about the city. One of the pigeons was even adorned with a Trump style wig according to NBC News.
“P.U.T.I.N. have used their pigeons to launch a one-of-a-kind aerial protest piece in response to the arrival of the 2020 Democratic Presidential hopefuls,” according to a group statement. “The release date was also coordinated to serve as a gesture of support and loyalty to President Trump.”
A total of twenty-five pigeons were released, 24 of them wearing hats and one donning the wig according to P.U.T.I.N. “Most have returned. We expect to see the rest tonight or tomorrow,” the group said.
While many have found the stunt humourous, Mariah Hillman, who runs a Las Vegas pigeon rescue organization, called the MAGA stunt “animal cruelty.”
This isn’t the first time Las Vegas has seen pigeons dressed up, videos of three pigeons wearing miniature red cowboy hats went viral back in December 2019.
“It started here with the press making fun of it, the police didn’t do anything about it, and now it’s grown into this, so when is it going to stop, and who’s going to do something about it?” Hillman said.
Hillman and her volunteers are setting traps to hopefully retrieve the pigeons so they can remove their hats before rehabilitating and releasing the birds.
P.U.T.I.N used eyelash glue to secure the hats to the pigeons’ heads.
“It doesn’t matter what kind of glue it is. It is still, in fact, cruelty, because you are impairing their vision,” Hillman said, adding that her organization rescues many birds, such as wedding-release pigeons and racing pigeons, that are trained to return to their flocks.
“There’s not always a guarantee that they’ll return, because they can get injured or killed before that happens.”"

That’s approximately 53 percent of the $3.8 billion the government is asking MPs to approve in supplementary spending according to CBC.
The ask comes as companies are turning away from doing business with Canada because of the blockades and protests. One president and CEO referred to the ongoing in Canada as a “ridiculous situation.”

Mohawk protestors have blockaded train tracks in Belleville Ontario for the last 15 days, demanding an end to the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern BC—a project approved by the Wet’suwet’en First Nation.
Conservative Treasury Board Critic Tim Uppal pledged that his party would work to ensure that the money was spent to improve the lives of Indigenous people: “Canada’s Conservatives have long advocated for the federal Liberal government to take more steps to ensure Indigenous peoples across the country are able to more fully participate in Canada’s economy.”"

No deadline or outlined plan has been publicly announced by the Trudeau government to lift the blockades. But on Wednesday, while talking with the BC government, he considered the idea of replacing the RCMP that are on Wet’suwet’en land with an Indigenous police force.
“This is an issue that obviously comes under the decision of the police forces and the province where the RCMP works as provincial police. This is exactly the kind of discussion and reflection that we are having to resolve this situation peacefully,” said Trudeau.
The idea was shut down by chief Na’Moks, who also goes by John Ridsdale. On Wednesday, he told the Star that they have not requested that the RCMP completely pull out of their territory but just the detachment that is situated near the blockade.
He said, “Not out there, they have no reason out there”  when referring to the RCMP. He added that they must withdraw the detachment or no meetings can be held with government ministers.
“You can’t have that all weighing on you and make clear and concise decisions. That’s not free, prior and informed consent in any way shape or form. When we say free, well, when you’re under duress that’s not free,” he said on Wednesday.
Na’Moks also mentioned that some of the hereditary chiefs were on their way to meet up with Mohawk communities in Montreal and thank them for their support in opposition to the pipeline.
When speaking of a meeting with Trudeau, Na’Moks said, “If we’re going to do a meeting, it should be on our territory. This is what we’re talking about. He should come and see how pristine and beautiful it is. Right now I’m looking at a blue sky and sunshine with snowcapped peaks.”
“You won’t know what we’re trying to do unless you put feet on the ground, breathe the air, have a look at the beautiful river, and eat the food here.”
Jagmeet Singh, the NDP leader addressed the issue saying, “Will the prime minister meet with the hereditary chiefs and appoint a special mediator?”
“The RCMP need to stand down to allow these conversations and dialogues to happen.”
According to a senior federal official, the option of using a mediator has not been ruled out though they are still waiting for a response to the offers made by the BC and federal governments to arrange a meeting.
Wilson-Raybould has asked the Wet’suwet’en to let Canadians know exactly who speaks for the community.
Trudeau has asked for patience as the blockades continue though many cannot afford patience at the moment.
Because of the blockades, Via Rail has been forced to lay off approximately 1,000 employees.
Cynthia Garneau, the President and CEO of Via said, “In 42 years of existence, it is the first time that Via Rail . . . has to interrupt most of its services across the country.”
Despite the calls for action, the Trudeau government has not set a deadline.
The Star reported Public Safety Minister, Bill Blair saying, “I’m reluctant to put a deadline to something because I find that that’s not a very effective means of negotiation.”
Trudeau said, “We know that people are facing shortages. They’re facing disruptions. They’re facing layoffs. That’s unacceptable. That’s why we are going to continue working extremely hard with everyone involved to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.”
“We understand how difficult this is for so many people who are facing shortages and layoffs right now, but we know we need to resolve this in a way that will not create more problems months from now and over the coming years,” he said in question period.
“That is why we are taking every step necessary to resolve this constructively, peacefully and rapidly.”
Mark Strahl, a Conservative MP referred to Trudeau saying, “He’s made promises to Indigenous communities about how different it was going to be with him as the prime minister. It hasn’t happened. He hasn’t resolved these long-standing issues. So the patience — patience to what end?” Strahl told reporters.
“Just simply so he can drag this out longer and hope that they get tired and go home seems to be the strategy.”"

Across the nation, railroads have been unusable for over the past two weeks.
Via Rail and CN Rail have now been shut down for 15 consecutive days, resulting in both companies being forced to lay off more than 1,000 total employees according to Global News.
“Today the prime minister will again engage with premiers in a call with the Council of the Federation. We’re working hard to reach a peaceful and lasting resolution.”  said Cameron Ahmad, director of communications for the Prime Minister’s Office.“From Day 1 the prime minister and ministers have been directly engaging with provincial governments to resolve this complex situation,”
Protestors behind the blockades claim they are acting in solidarity with some of the hereditary chiefs of B.C.’s Wet’suwet’en First Nation who are opposed to the Coastal GasLink natural gas line project. This claim remains despite the fact that the majority of Wet’suwet’en people voted to approve the project.
The five hereditary chiefs who oppose the project are a minority of the 13 total hereditary chiefs of the community who do support the project. Members of the Mohawk community in Tyendinaga and Kahnawake said they are protesting in solidarity with those five Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs who stand against the Coastal GasLink project.
The elected band council for the Wet’suwet’en people also support the pipeline, as do 20 other First Nations that are along the proposed route.
Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller is confident that this new meeting will bring a resolution to this ongoing dispute.
“These are opportunities to come to a peaceful resolution,” Miller told reporters in Ottawa. “I think this will give us an increased opportunity to have those discussions so we can de-escalate.”
RCMP in B.C. offered to leave the area of the territory the Wet’suwet’en claim as their traditional lands despite having a court injunction to remove the protestors from the area.
Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said he feels the RCMP’s move will show some good faith, “the conditions have now been met” for a resolution. “I believe the time has come for the barricades to come down,” he said."

The Conservative leadership candidate would introduce a government policy where blockades are quickly cleared by police so it doesn’t get to the stage where “clearing them risks violence”.
“Peacefully protesting is a key type of speech that our government must protect,” read an O’Toole campaign statement, released on Thursday. “Intimidation and physically preventing people from going about their lives is different. It is a form of common law assault and should, in the appropriate situations, be treated as such.”
O’Toole’s new plan has come out at the same time that rival Peter MacKay deleted a tweet supporting Albertans who took it upon themselves to take apart a blockade. In the heavily criticized tweet, MacKay said he was “glad to see a couple Albertans with a pickup truck can do more for our economy in an afternoon than Justin Trudeau could do in four years.”
The tweets that MacKay posted after deleting his original showed a softened stance on the issue compared to the first, saying things like, “peaceful removal of debris deliberately placed on a railway that posed a threat to public safety.”
The plan released by O’Toole on Thursday blamed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for the current state of the blockades that were started to show support for the Wet’suwet’en community.
“The Liberals are the party that began the Shut Down Canada culture by cancelling pipelines, banning tankers and bringing forward Bill C-69 over the objections of a majority of provinces,”  noted O’Toole’s statement. “The illegal blockaders took their cues from the Trudeau Liberals.”
He added that Trudeau’s “weakness and indecision” led to the blockades. He also said that Trudeau has “made it crystal clear that he will not stand up for the rule of law but will instead bow down to those who want to shut down our economy.”
According to O’Toole, his plan will “get our economy moving and ensure that any group with a grievance will not be able to shut it down again at a moment’s notice.”
He noted that he would bring in legislation titled the Freedom of Movement Act as prime minister. This legislation would call transportation routes such as inter-provincial railways, national highways, international bridges and ports “Critical National Infrastructure to make it clear that the federal government takes responsibility for keeping them open.”
The legislation would make blocking “a railway, airport, port, or major road, or to block the entrance to a business or household in a way that prevents people from lawfully entering or leaving” a criminal offence.
Police would also be able to clear blockades without the need of a court injunction.
“Organizations should not have to wait for the courts and then see them ignored or have to endure more intimidation and loss before an injunction is enforced in order to simply continue operating legally.”
Courts would need to believe that the legislation goes hand in hand with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for it to be introduced.
O’Toole also said that he would “amend the tax code to remove charitable status from any group that has accepted foreign funds and has engaged in action related to the offences outlined above for blockading critical public infrastructure” and he would make the necessary efforts to “improve trust between Indigenous communities and law enforcement by creating and funding a specialized RCMP Aboriginal Liaison Officer position.”
He would also introduce a pilot program that will “deploy these specialized officers to communities that have high levels of off-reserve Aboriginal populations and/or a high number of missing or murdered Indigenous women cold cases.”"

A statement released by the company says, “We’ve obtained the injunction and are hoping for a swift resolution of this incident so that passenger commuter rail service can resume.”
On Thursday, François Legault, the Premier of Quebec said, “Once the injunction is granted, we will dismantle the blockade.”
The injunction was filed by CN Rail on Wednesday because a blockade was formed on the Mont-Saint-Hilaire train line close to Saint-Lambert station.
According to Legault, the Longueuil police were responsible for removing the blockade and would apply force if they had to.
The story in BC is very different with the RCMP offering to remove themselves from the Wet’suwet’en territory.
Service on the Mont-Saint-Hilaire train line was cancelled by transit operator, Exo, who said it was not possible “due to the shortage of buses and drivers in the metropolitan area.”
This train is the second to encounter difficulties in the Montreal area. In Kahnawake, a blockade caused Exo to discontinue travel on the Candiac line. The travel has been discontinued since February 10.
According to Legault, the Quebec government is not going to dismantle that blockade because it is located on Mohawk territory.
A protestor named Pierre-Oliver Parent noted that he felt he should be at the blockade to condemn the government’s actions.
“I’m a white settler, I’m a construction worker,” said Parent. “It’s a huge issue … it’s not the Canada that I want to live in.”
On Thursday, one man decided to attempt to take down the Saint-Lambert blockade on his own while swearing and yelling at the protestors. The man tore a cord that was supporting the banners and said that the protestors didn’t have the right to be blocking trains.
Marie-Therese Belanger, who lives close to the blockade said that she supports what the protestors are doing. She went to the blockade to show her support.
“Someone has to stand up and talk, and if it doesn’t work, this is what you have to do,” said Belanger. “I hope they’ll win.”
Parent said he hopes that the blockades prove to the government that “a large solidarity” is shared with the Wet’suwet’en people.
“We see that people are being touched by the injustice … and injustice to one is an injustice to all,” said Parent.
“All our brothers from each nation, we need to stand together.” he said"

Most of them are showing their support for the hereditary chiefs who disagree with the construction of the $6.6 billion Coastal GasLink pipeline through their land in northern BC, according to CBC News.
It is now known that many Wet’suwet’en people support the pipeline and are angered by the ongoing protests. Some people see the natural gas pipeline as a chance to build their community with the new jobs it will bring.

Though there is still some division in the community, the 20 elected First Nations councils have signed agreements and shown their support for the project.
The national protests began when some of the hereditary chiefs showed their opposition to the project and claimed that it violated their rights.
On Wednesday, the community of Houston held an event at a movie theatre and brought out about 200 people from their community of 2,000, for three hours. Houston is located right on the path of the pipeline. The pro-pipeline event had Wet’suwet’en Nation members explaining why they support the project.
TRUTH BOMB DROPPED: ""Go away! I want them to leave.""

During the meeting people mentioned that they wanted to see the economic opportunities that could be created by the construction.
One of the supporters, Robert Skin, was an elected member of the Skin Tyee First Nation council which is also a part of the Wet’suwet’en Nation. He noted that the pipeline will give the next generation a better life.
“With the benefit agreement that [the Skin Tyee] did sign, I see us being in a better place even within the next five years,” he said.
When he was talking at the theatre, he noted that the protestors only have “one side of the story” and are not looking at the positive things that the project could bring.
As the lumber industry has been struggling in the region many people at the event explained that they wanted more of the community to have job opportunities so that they could provide for their families.
The Wet’suwet’en people also said that the protests have made conflict in the community worse than before. Some also noted that they did not want to see a separation between the First Nation and Canada.
Another part of the Wet’suwet’en Nation called the Witset First Nation is very divided on the issue according to Edward Tom, who told CBC that he thought the protestors are “very pugnacious and overbearing,” and added, “They’re professional protestors.”
A lot of people in attendance said that protestors seem to be unaware that many Wet’suwet’en people want the pipeline to be built. The people who have backed the pipeline said that they have received threats and intimidation from other members of the community.
The event marked Marion Tiljoe Shepard’s first time voicing her support for the project. She has a trucking company in the area and feels that the project will help her business along with others in the area. Shepard said that the protestors do not represent her or her community.
“It’s none of their business,” she said. “All of these protesters don’t have the right to close down railways and ships. It’s not right. Go away. I want them to leave.”"
0,2020-02-19T11:01:58.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/will-censorship-get-worse-when-donald-trump-is-re-elected,Will censorship get worse when Donald Trump is re-elected?,"It seems counter-intuitive to claim that the re-election of the free-speech champion, the notorious politically incorrect jackhammer, Donald Trump, would pave the way to greater censorship rather than greener pastures.
Let me be clear: I’m saying if a Democrat wins in 2020, the first wave of censorship would have proven to be not only an effective political strategy, but it would achieve what Project Veritas has exposed as Silicon Valley’s desire to “change the way people think.” The digital book burners, modern-day tyrants, and behavioral re-educators, could take pause, needing only to tweak the successful model to be re-deployed in future elections, and set on autopilot.
What happens when the king senses his power is fading, and control is slipping from his grasp? Typically, they double-down on the very behavior that makes him the tyrant in the first place. If the past is prologue, then the re-election of Donald Trump will be the breaking point in 2020. The first wave of censorship would be deemed a failure, requiring retaliation and a second wave of expurgation. Unfortunately, what is even more chilling is that the political excommunication will worsen, and Donald Trump will do nothing about it.
According to a recent press pool report, the president applauded the so-called MAGA club. “For 144 days, we set a record stock market. It means 401Ks, it means jobs. Four trillion-dollar companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft. You have MAGA. The trillion-dollar club.” Perhaps, he may be more concerned with the flattering numbers of financial success rather than the staggering numbers of banned or demonetized patriots: Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes, Steven Crowder, Laura Loomer, and the list is literally endless.
Within minutes at the Social Media Summit, intended to highlight big tech censorship and biases, the president began to compliment the stock market and skyrocketing 401(k)s. Great, slow hand clap. Unfortunately, Trump’s showmanship on censorship won’t repair the harm done to those banned online, many of which depended on their conservative activism for a living, and ultimately assisted the president in his electoral success.
Is it financial success if the next 50+ years are consumed by technological oppression? None of the major players banned were in attendance even though they are widely credited for the president’s election. Why, are they too controversial? Would it detract from the summit’s purpose? On the contrary, it would have reinforced its objective. But, we as conservatives have allowed the left to designate what is considered fringe within our own party; meanwhile, the radical left runs rampant with no guardrails or moderators, only having drunken cheerleaders on the sidelines.
The left has lost the battle through the judicial system, and they have been unable to materialize hate speech as a legal definition. Consequently, leftist technology companies are embracing the concept of hate speech by creating community guidelines and banishing violators from their platforms.
Recently reported by The Post Millennial, Censored.TV, founded by Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes, has been banned on Facebook and Instagram and it is literally impossible to send links to his channel through private communication or DMs. The leftist behavioral re-educators not only want to control what you post in public and in private, they seek to control how you think about issues through conditioning and intimidation.
According to Statista, 59 percent of the earth’s population is plugged into the world wide web, approximately 4.54 billion people. More than ever these social media platforms and applications are an essential component in our social environment and establishing itself as the modern public square. Ignoring the phenomena of digital gulags would hinder controversial, provocative, and inquisitive thinkers from ever reaching an audience, and without radicals, we wouldn’t have Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King, Jr., or the other Martin Luther.
Out of fear of violating conservative orthodoxy and the idolization of free-market absolutism, we are afraid to take meaningful steps in reigning in the political targeting and digital assassination exhibited by those who control information. YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, is the second largest search engine, and many of the conservative firebrands have been de-platformed and deprived of access to a market that many leftist radicals continue to reach and enjoy.
If the right doesn’t take action on censorship in fear of advancing the tentacles of big government, then the Trump phenomenon will fade; meanwhile, the burgeoning tentacles of big tech will strangle conservatism into a slow death, and there are only so many missteps one can make before the fall becomes fatal. Behold America, a new tyranny is amongst us. A citizen-tyranny where fellow Americans report you not to the government, but to a soy-pounding drone tech employee, sifting through content and complaints made for your improper and impure thoughts (posts).
How would the great architects of Western civilization see today’s frenzy of censorship? We have inherited the world’s greatest tradition and we are squandering it to pathological political knuckle-draggers. Aristotle famously said, “Man is by nature a political animal” with the gift of contemplation and the power of morality. It is indisputable that those who have been targeted for censorship are not the hate-mongers they’ve been falsely accused of being. The real hatemongers are hiding in plain sight, like David Duke, Richard Spencer and radical Islamic terrorists. Strangely, they all have been graced with the privilege of maintaining Twitter along with other various social media accounts. Perhaps, it serves the left’s purpose to raise certain individuals to prominence while degrading true conservatives into obscurity.
Aristotle would have probably agreed, to deny a man his political voice, is to deny him his humanity."

“[Mr. Trudeau] wants it to be done in peace. We agree with that, but there must be results and, for the moment, the situation has become very dramatic for the Quebec economy,” said Mr. Legault told the press. The federal government must resolve the crisis in the short term, in “the next few days,” he said otherwise the situation will only get worse.
In particular, the Premier of Quebec says he is worried that the Port of Montreal will no longer be able to receive new goods because there will be no space to store them. Legault also expressed concerns that stores may soon start to run out of certain items according to Le Journal de Quebec.
“We are losing control. I don’t want to fall back into the propane crisis with the farmers, I don’t want people to be unable to take off from planes because there is no more fuel,” said François Legault.
Justin Trudeau has been the subject of much criticism for being abroad while the country was at an impasse. Trudeau has stated that he would like all parties involved to remain “patient” until a peaceful resolution can be reached.
The Minister of Indigenous Services Marc Miller and the Mohawks of Tyendinaga, Ontario held a meeting at a local community centre for many hours although they have not released much details on what their conversations entailed."
0,2020-02-19T07:00:47.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/pete-buttigieg-isnt-gay-enough-for-queer-activists,Pete Buttigieg isn’t gay enough for queer activists,"In a sane world, the LGBT community and its allies would be ecstatic that a gay presidential candidate would be receiving not only national attention but real traction with a surging campaign. A few years ago (before the woke cult takeover), this would have signified a huge step forward for acceptance. However, to the surprise of some, Pete Buttigieg is facing backlash from insatiable queer activists who cite his “white audience” and lack of concerns for the broader LGBT community. It’s important to note that this “broader LGBT community” is being expanded and stretched daily. Even most LGBT people can’t keep up.
While speaking at the San Francisco’s National LGBTQ Center for the Arts, Buttigieg was protested by a group called Queers Against Pete who began chanting “Boot-Edge-Edge!” (a degrading reference to Buttigieg being a “bootlicker.” This is a common, irrational attack by radical activists against minorities who dare disagree with them on any level.
One of the protestors spoke to the Guardian and stated, “it’s hard to enjoy or appreciate” Buttigieg’s status as a gay candidate because he speaks “to a predominantly white, upper-class audience”. Other protestors cited Buttigieg ’s refusal to boycott Chick-fil-A.
An open statement from Queers Against Pete reads, “Some have touted former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s openly gay identity as proof of progress in our politics. However, being gay is not enough to earn the support of LGBTQIA communities. We cannot in good conscience allow Mayor Pete to become the nominee without demanding that he address the needs and concerns of the broader Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual communities.”
Alright, here’s the part where I give up objectivity and insert my opinion—THIS IS RIDICULOUS! As a Republican, I will not be voting for Buttigieg. However, even I can acknowledge the positive step forward in terms of culture that he represents. A few years ago, the idea of a gay candidate having any chance of becoming President whatsoever would have been laughable at best. Despite our political differences, I think it’s awesome representation for the community. But of course, you can never appease the woke mob- you can never be gay enough, and you never been progressive enough. The goalpost will always be moved toward further radicalism, and anyone who doesn’t instantly move with it will be left behind and cancelled.
As far as I can see, Buttigieg’s policies land firmly in the “progressive” lane, yet still don’t meet the standards of those who see white gay men in the same way they see other “privileged” demographics. The possibility of the first gay President and his husband living in the White House means nothing to the rabid mob. Only time will tell if the radical or moderate voices will rise to the top and determine Buttigieg’s fate."

The poll also suggests that about three of four Canadian respondents believe that the federal government should step up and address the issues affecting Indigenous people in Canada, according to an Ipsos poll commissioned by Global News.
Ipsos published a poll on Wednesday regarding the protests against the natural gas pipeline that is meant to be built in Northern British Columbia.
According to the survey, 61 percent of people don’t agree that the protesters involved in the blockades are carrying out legitimate or justified protests. The results show that 39 percent of respondents agree that they are justified and legitimate protests.
Darrell Bricker, the CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs said, “It’s the first poll that we’ve ever done on this issue. The first takeaway is that Canadians are not pleased to see ports and railways blocked.”
“In fact, they so don’t agree with it that almost half of Canadians—actually better than half, 53 percent—actually think the police should move in and do something about it.”
“What we also see in the polling is that… [75 per cent] of the people we interviewed are saying that something needs to be done about the plight of the Aboriginal community and that the government hasn’t performed particularly well on this,” said Bricker.
Coastal GasLink—the company attempting to build the pipeline—has signed agreements with all 20 First Nations elected councils on the pipeline route. There are however, some hereditary chiefs disagree with the action and oppose the $6.6-billion project all together.
As a result of the ongoing blockades, CN Rail has been forced to shut down its eastern Canada operations.
Prime Minister Trudeau had to cancel his out of country tour in order to return to Canada and deal with the ongoing tensions. The House of Commons held an emergency debate on Tuesday.
When asked if they believe that indigenous people have been properly consulted by the government, 56 percent of respondents said yes while 44 percent disagreed.
“They are trying to reconcile two things in their minds: one of them is a legitimate concern that Canadians have about the situation and the plight of Aboriginal people in this country—it’s quite clear that there’s a fairly deep feeling that something needs to be done on that… but on the other hand, even though they feel that this is an important thing that needs to be dealt with, they don’t feel that protesting by shutting down rail lines and shutting down ports is the correct response,” said Bricker.
Bricker added that there are differing views among Canada’s different regions but Alberta and BC are aligned on certain issues.
“This is one of the only issues I’ve seen in which British Columbia and Alberta actually align—when natural resources are concerned,” said Bricker, who added that the poll results show “younger Canadians are more aligned with the Aboriginal community.”
In Alberta, 69 percent of respondents support police intervention while in BC, 68 percent support it. Quebec has the highest opposition to police intervention with 38 per cent and Ontario comes after with 29 percent.
Bricker said that in his polling experience “the longer that things go on like this, the more the pressure builds on the government.”
“Public order is one of those things that is really regarded as a primary responsibility for the government and to the extent that… [the public] perceives that things are out of control, the worse it gets for the government.”"

The railroad tracks in Belleville, Ont. have now been halted for the last 12 straight days and don’t have an end date in sight at this time. The protestors vow to remain there until the government cancels the proposed Coastal GasLink pipeline that will partially run through the unceded land of the Wet’suwet’en First Nations.
The consequences of these blockades are already being felt across the country as the movement of goods has been greatly delayed. Experts now say that gas prices in Lower Mainland BC are expected to rise as a result of these protests.
Kent Fellows, an Alberta-based economist at the University of Calgary predicts the spike could be anywhere from 10 to 30 cents per litre. “If blockades persist you will definitely see an increase in fuel prices… A lot of the volume that is coming in from Alberta refineries to the Lower Mainland is now on rail.”

“You can’t go without gas, much like you can’t go without utilities or food. It’s above my paygrade to solve that problem.”
Trudeau recently held a meeting to attempt to remedy the problem of growing frustrations on both sides of the issue.
“I understand how worrisome this is, and difficult. We are going to continue to focus on resolving this situation quickly and peacefully,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The Port of Vancouver has also been affected by the demonstrations, preventing the loading and unloading of cargo.

“Let me be clear Mr. Speaker, standing between our country and prosperity is a small group of radical activists, many of whom have little to no connection to First Nations communities. A bunch of radical activists who won’t rest until our oil and gas industry is entirely shut down.”
“Now they may have the luxury of not having to go to work every day. They may have the luxury of not facing repercussions for skipping class, but they are blockading our ports, our railways, and our borders and roads and highways. They are appropriating an Indigenous agenda which they are willfully misrepresenting.”
This comes in response to Trudeau’s statement on February 17, wherein Trudeau gave little insight into what action would be taken. “We had a good meeting with morning with the incident response group, discussions with ministers, I made some phone calls to Indigenous leadership as well as a number of premiers. I understand how worrisome this is for so many Canadians and difficult for many families across the country. We’re going to continue to focus on resolving the situation quickly and peacefully, and that’s what we’re going to do.”

Scheer called the statement a “complete advocation of responsibility and of leadership.”
Scheer also highlighted that the majority of members of the Wet’suwet’en people were in support of the coastal gas link project. “every single elected band council on the gas link route supports this project. The majority of hereditary chiefs support this project.”

The motion will be introduced by Bloc leader Yves-Francois Blanchet. The motion suggests, “That the House call on the government to not authorize the Teck Frontier mine development, as this project can not be reconciled with the Paris Agreement targets.”
Bloc MP Alain Therrien has also supported the motion.
Two more motions will be brought forward by the Bloc, though only one will be chosen to be put up for debate in the House of Commons. The Bloc has not yet specified the motion that will move ahead.
Non-political regulators have already given their approval for the $20.6-billion northern Alberta project. The Liberal natural resources minister noted that their approval of the project may be delayed if Alberta continues to oppose Ottawa’s carbon tax. Many eastern Liberal MPs do not want the project to go through it all.
The federal government has indicated it may be abandoning the project, though Teck claims that it will help the GDP of the province and create approximately 7,000 jobs.
A statement was just released by Teck noting that by 2050 it plans to be a net-zero emitter.
The statement on the company’s website says the project, “will consist of surface mining operations, a processing plant, tailings management facilities, water management facilities, and associated infrastructure and support facilities.”
The project is estimated to generate around 260,000 oil barrels in a single day.
All of the 14 Indigenous communities in the project area have come to agreements with Teck.
According to the federal government, they will not be giving an answer any time before late February.
Federal Environment Minister Johnathan Wilkinson said that environmental impacts would be taken into account before the project is approved.
“With respect to (Frontier), we need to look at all the environmental impacts, we obviously need to look at the economic opportunities, and we need to ensure we’re taking both into account,” said Wilkinson.
“Certainly, one of those issues is how does this project fit with Canada’s commitments to achieving the reductions we are committing to (for) 2030, and the net zero commitment to 2050? I would just say again that it’s important that all provinces are working to help Canada to achieve its targets.”
Wilkinson noted that every province should be expected to help the country achieve those goals.
The industrial emitter plan, TIER (Technology, Innovation and Emissions Reduction) was revealed by the UCP government in bill 19.
This plan came in place of the NDP’s climate Leadership Plan by revoking carbon tax on residents and some businesses while keeping the tax on the big emitters.
The TIER plan gives facilities a number of options such as reducing emissions or paying $30 per tonne in a TIER fund.
The federal carbon tax challenge was brought forward by the Alberta government in 2019. Arguments went ahead in Alberta’s Court of Appeal on Dec. 16-18."

A recent Facebook post that has been shared almost 5,000 times in its first day talks about the personal relationship that Terri Tilijoe has had with the Hereditary Chiefs of the Wet’suwe’ten people.
Terri is caucasian although she is a member of the Westbank First Nation and has been since she was 16, through her marriage with Larry Tilijoe, who is Unistoten. She believes that the vast majority of Wet’suwet’en people are in favour of the pipeline, estimating it’s about 85 percent.
The post began with Tiljoe stating, “I see all these posts supporting a few OW Hereditary Chiefs but what I don’t see is the Wetsuweten people speaking up about how this office operates. I get it though, I live on Westbank First Nation, I see exactly how opportunities are disbursed based on whether you are ‘one of them’ or ‘one of us’.”
Tiljoe described her experience with the OW Chiefs and how “In 1993, we started a silviculture business, Nadina Mountain Contracting, located within the Morice Forest District. Our goal was to become a sustainable First Nation contractor who harvested, replanted and rejuvenated the areas we harvested.”
“The OW, situated an hour east of Houston, took over ALL the forest related activities earmarked as First Nations. We were forced to work under the OW for contracts within our own forests; the OW took a portion of the contract value for the ‘service’. The OW’s lack of knowledge in forest health and neglect in their financial responsibilities continually caused our business to suffer hardship which rippled to our banker, our employees, and our suppliers.”
“I personally question the integrity of some of the chiefs, and I wonder if it’s the same case with CGL; that the OW wants to control ALL the negotiations, ALL the monies, ALL the contracts and ALL benefits and administer it back to the Bands in the territory? As it stands the individual bands will receive the monies and benefits and not the OW. If the OW can’t have it ALL then NO one will have anything.”
The protests continue while the Trudeau government continues to dither twelve days in, while various road and rail blockades cripples the transport of goods and people."

The bridge is located in Gananoque near Kingston Ont.
The bridge allows access to US from Canada however both ways had previously been restricted due to the protests. The traffic restrictions were lifted as of 3 p.m. Monday.
As of 3:00pm today traffic restrictions have been lifted from the Canadian span of the Thousand Islands Bridge Crossing and normal traffic will resume.— Thousand Isle Bridge (@TIsleBridge) February 17, 2020
Many commuters were stuck at the border for such as Dan Vance who told Global News he was halted for 45 minutes on his back from the U.S. The 59-year-old was in Canada customs paying taxes when he was delayed.
“Hopefully, it’s no more than an hour or two but right here, this time of year, right around the Thousand Islands nothing is opened because it’s wintertime,” Vance said.

The railway blockages and protests have been happening for the last three weeks in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs who oppose the pipeline.

The elected Indigenous councils have already signed an agreement with Coastal GasLink to approve the route however some hereditary chiefs oppose it and claim to have rights over the unceded land.
Niagra Falls, Ont. and Niagra Falls, N.Y. also had a group of protestors shut down the border crossing however they left on Sunday of their own accord.
There are other protests currently happening throughout the country."

According to the Chinese government, Dr Liu Zhiming is said to be undergoing resuscitation after contracting the deadly virus but is alive, despite some reports claiming he had died. Many Chinese citizens remain skeptical of the news that Dr Liu remains alive due to previous attempts to cover up deaths of medical personnel.
Dr Li Wenliang died of coronavirus earlier this month. Wenliang was responsible for making knowledge of the coronavirus public and was punished for doing so by Chinese officials. His hospital denied any reports of his death initially before confirming it according to the Daily Mail.
All media outlets were instructed to suppress the coverage of the passing of Dr Li Wenliang. The news of this denial caused a great backlash from the public over the cover-up. Many took to social media to express their rage with the government however their posts were quickly censored.
“He wasn’t allowed to speak. He wasn’t even allowed to die,” wrote one person via the Chinese messaging app WeChat.
“Dr Li Wenliang was only allowed to ‘die’ after most web users had gone to bed,” wrote another person.
Dr Li’s family was paid just over $150,000 after Beijing ruled his death a ‘work place injury’ following the online backlash for the whistleblower.
Liu Fan, 59, was a nurse at Wuchang Hospital who died of the coronavirus after contracting the disease at work last Friday. It’s suspected that Ms. Liu became infected with the disease after failing to get a hazmat suit due to the shortage of medical supplies in Wuhan. The hospital has denied any such rumours.
The hospital released a statement urging all medical workers to protect themselves during work.
It continued: “All neighbourhood clinics need to enforce personal preventative measures according to requirement.”
“In this battle, the virus is cruel. We express our deepest condolences for comrade Liu Fan’s passing”
“We sincerely hope all medical workers remain healthy and will return safe and sound after the battle.”
Chinese authorities have said that those who died from contracting coronavirus in the line of duty should be named martyrs. The Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission said that family members of medical workers who’ve passed should receive financial compensation from the government.
Dr. Liu was the most high-profile medical worker to contract the virus and die and became even more famous after being reprimanded by police and accused of spreading “fake news.” It was in response to a social media post of Dr. Liu, warning of “SARS at a Wuhan seafood market” on December 30. Li’s post came two weeks before the coronavirus broke out in the city."

Wuhan has been under lockdown since Jan. 23 in the wake of the coronavirus that began there and has now infected at least 67,000 people and killed more than 1,500. The majority of cases have been in the Hubei province, where the city of Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, is located.
China has so far quarantined more than 50 million people in the Hubei province and all transportation in and out has been shut down.
Shramko can leave her loft in Wuhan, although officers will check her temperature and she is required to wear a mask. Officers patrol the street and and shops to make sure that people comply with the precautions.
Shramko was born and raised in Vancouver and met her boyfriend in Wuhan during a month-long trip to the city. She moved there to be with him about a year prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Shramko’s boyfriend was not in Wuhan at the time of the shutdown due to a business trip. He isn’t allowed to return as per the quarantine rules, so he is currently staying with his family in another province.
Shramko had initially registered herself to be on an evacuation flight when Canadian authorities began chartering flights to get citizens back to Canada, however the strict no-pet policy forced Shramko to make the tough decision to remain in Wuhan to take care of her cat.
“I don’t know when the epidemic will be over so it’s kind of abandoning her in a way, even if I give her to a friend,” Shramko told Business Insider.
Shramko went on to describe the mental conditions of living in quarantine.
“After a month of just being alone and not having that much human interaction, it really takes its toll mentally,” Shramko said
“It’s pretty much a ghost town outside,” she said. “I live directly across from a huge mall and this mall was always packed with people. Even the street to get into the mall’s parking lot was always busy. Now, there are no cars at all and nobody outside.”
Shramko described many of the grocery stores shelves as being barren. She spends her time working on her YouTube channel, watching a Chinese version of Netflix, reading books and playing with Kitya.
She communicates often with her boyfriend and family back in Canada.
“They update me on what they’re hearing about the coronavirus in Canada and I let them know what’s going on in China,” she said.
The Chinese government has extended foreigner visas as a result of the epidemic, however money is getting tight for those forced to stay in quarantine.
“Nobody is working right now so there is no income,” Shramko said. “I’m trying to save as much money as possible since we don’t know when all of this will be over.”
Shramko was initially unphased by the coronavirus lockdown.
“In my mind, a super contagious and deadly virus just didn’t seem real,” she said. “It seemed like something you only saw in movies. After a few weeks, it really kicked in that this was a serious matter.”
Shramko said she understands the circumstances she’s in and doesn’t resent the Chinese government’s handling of the virus.
“I can’t say that I’ve put all my faith in the Chinese government, but I can say that they are doing their best,” she said. “It’s a highly contagious virus, so it’s hard to control.”
Shramko is getting restless to return to Canada now and wishes the government would allow her to take her cat on the plane.
“She’s been there for me throughout this whole quarantine,” Shramko said of her cat. “I should be there for her, too.”"
0,2020-02-16T10:03:56.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/petition-against-liberal-gun-ban-closes-and-makes-canadian-history,Petition against Liberal gun ban closes and makes Canadian history,"Saturday was the final day for the petition against the Liberal gun ban that received a Canadian historical record of 174,810 signatures from angry Canadians, many of whom are law-abiding gun owners.
The Liberal government wants to ban “military assault rifles” in Canada while there is no legal definition for that type of weapon in our country, according to Public Safety Canada. The petition officially opened on Dec. 17, 2019.
If the ban were to go through, Canadian gun owners would be stripped of guns that have been legally purchased. Many Canadians do not want to allow this to happen and petition E-2341 was created as a result.
“Public safety should always be the top priority of any government. The focus therefore must be directed towards criminals who use illegal firearms and put the safety of our communities at risk.” said Conservative MP Glen Motz, who was the one to back the petition.
“Canada’s legal firearms owners are among the most scrutinized in Canadian society. Nonetheless, they are the target of a misguided Liberal plan determined to make criminals out of them with a proposed ban on ‘military-style assault rifles’. As we know, there is no legal definition for ‘military-style assault rifles’ in Canada.”
“The use of this term is a deliberate, politically motivated attempt by the Liberals to misinform Canadians and seeks to target certain firearms without a rational basis. If the government is referring to military grade firearms, those capable of firing multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger (fully automatic) and with large capacity magazines, they are already prohibited in Canada and have been for decades. Firearms should be classified by what they can do, not by how they look.”
Minister of Public Safety Bill Blair previously estimated that the buyback program that has been suggested would cost anywhere from $400 to $600 million. Blair’s office did not respond to request for comment from The Post Millennial. Previously Blair’s office told TPM the Liberals ban would not target hunters, but did not specify what guns would be on the list.
The bulk of the petitions votes came from Ontario with over 56,000. Alberta and B.C. also provided a large number of votes with 37,500 in Alberta and 34,300 in BC."

Mind Medicine Inc. is running clinical trials with psychedelic based drugs, according to Bloomberg.
“Our ambition is to be one of the first publicly listed neuro-pharmaceutical companies developing psychedelic medicines,” said JR Rahn, the company’s co-founder and co-chief executive. The company is currently gearing up to list on Canadian stock exchanges, pending final approvals. Mind Medicine Inc. is hoping to list on Toronto’s NEO Exchange by the first week of March.
While it may seem like a bit of a stretch for people to accept the idea of a company working with psychedelic drugs like MDMA and psilocybin, many Canadians quickly became comfortable with the legal use of cannabis since October 2018.
Companies have been experimenting at a growing rate with clinical trials of psychedelic treatments for mental health issues such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and curing addiction to other drugs such as nicotine and heroin.
The US Food and Drug Administration recently granted certain companies a legal way to conduct research on otherwise illegal drugs which will open the door to public listings.
Ronan Levy is the executive chairman of Field Trip Psychedelics Inc. and his company is building a network of clinics that will focus on ketamine-enhanced psychotherapy. The first clinic will open in Toronto as early as next month with more clinics to open in New York City in Los Angeles.
The work that these psychedelic companies are doing is legal in the U.S. because they aren’t using cannabis and that allows for “greater opportunity to access growth capital from private investors in the U.S. who may not touch cannabis,” Levy said.
It’s worth noting that this will be an industry separate from cannabis, which can only grow so large due to the substance’s illegality in the US The cannabis industry has also recently seen stock prices collapse amid slower sales in Canada as of late.
“I think that the psychedelics industry could be much bigger than the cannabis industry because it’s going to attract institutional capital and already is starting to,” Rahn said. “It’s also going to be a more concentrated space because the barriers to entry are much higher.”"

CBC News reported that the Privacy Commissioner’s office noted that they saw “strong indications of systemic under-reporting.”
Many people who were affected by the privacy breaches were not notified.
The breaches were not explained by the federal government when they received an order paper question from Conservative MP Dean Allison. The errors were anywhere from small mistakes to large breaches that included sensitive and personal information.
David Fraser, a Halifax lawyer at McInnes Cooper said, “There’s a significant problem with the way that the government protects personal information.”
“The numbers that we’re consistently seeing reported out of the federal government are higher than they should be and significantly higher in my view.”
Most of the breaches involved the Canadian Revenue Agency with over 3,005 different incidents that ultimately affected around 60,000 Canadians. The breaches took place between Jan 1 2018 and Dec 10, 2019.
The reasons the department gives for these errors are security occurrences, misdirected mail and employee misconduct.
CRA spokesperson, Etienne Biram said, “We consider a single privacy breach to be one too many. Two-thirds of the total individuals affected were as a result of three unfortunate but isolated incidents.”
In January 2019, the personal information of 11,780 people was accidentally made accessible to employees of the CRA.
Another incident involved one CRA employee who was able to view the information of 11,745 people by accessing certain accounts.
“These individuals are not notified since the risk to them is deemed to be extremely low,” said Biram.
Throughout the same time period, Health Canada saw 122 breaches which affected about 24,000 people.
CBC had 17 breaches resulting in the information of over 20,000 employees being at risk.
There were over 2,000 combined breaches within Refugees and Citizenship Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada.
Some of the breaches at Employment and Social Development Canada included birth certificates and passports being mishandled and sometimes lost.
Errors were also reported by the RCMP, the Communications Security Establishment, Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the Department of National Defence.
Fraser noted that private sector firms follow strict rules by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and the government should have higher standards for breaches and the protection on personal information.
“In the private sector, individuals can choose what businesses they do business with. If they don’t like the privacy practices of a bank, they can go to another,” Fraser told CBC News.
“But we don’t get to choose as citizens what governments we deal with, and governments are custodians of a significant amount of highly sensitive personal information.”
An Office of the Privacy Commissioner spokesperson noted that the order paper question is still being reviewed.
Vito Pilieci said, “We have raised concerns about strong indications of systemic under-reporting of certain types of breaches across government.”
Canada Research Chair in Information Law and Policy at University of Ottawa, Teresa Scassa said that when the government makes errors like this, they can not be trusted to always report their mistakes.
“That is the classic conundrum. On the one hand, you don’t want to get people so used to data breaches … so that every time they get a notification they think, ‘Whatever, doesn’t matter.’ You want people to pay attention when it’s necessary to pay attention,” said. Scassa
“At the same time, you don’t want the discretion being exercised on the side of avoiding embarrassment, so that internally the nature of the severity of the breaches is played down because an organization really just doesn’t want to have to own up to the fact that they’ve had a significant data breach.”"

Hart’s past was brought to attention when she revealed this information according to Fox News.
It was revealed by independent journalist Mike Cernovich that the former Memphis City School Board President has a history of Democratic activism and anti-Trump posts on social media. Hart is also a failed Democratic candidate.

Hart had actually made posts about Stone’s case on social media. She has called Trump and his supporters racists after showing her support for Robert Mueller’s investigation—the investigation that eventually ended up with the prosecution of Stone. Stone may face many years in prison.
How on earth did the judge—who gagged Roger Stone himself during his trial—allow a Russian collusion hoaxer who ran for Congress as a Democrat, was a practicing attorney, and was posting about Trump during the trial to sit on the jury as its foreman? https://t.co/ze0W8acyYh— Sean Davis (@seanmdav) February 13, 2020
In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Hart gave her appreciation for the prosecutors, “I have kept my silence for months. Initially, it was for my safety. Then, I decided to remain silent out of fear of politicizing the matter.”
“But I can’t keep quiet any longer. I want to stand up for Aaron Zelinsky, Adam Jed, Michael Marando, and Jonathan Kravis – the prosecutors on the Roger Stone trial.” All four have since withdrawn.
“It pains me to see the DOJ now interfere with the hard work of the prosecutors. They acted with the utmost intelligence, integrity, and respect for our system of justice. For that, I wanted to speak up for them and ask you to join me in thanking them for their service,” said Hart.
OAN’s Jack Posobeic revealed Hart’s testimony in court as a prospective juror. Hart had stated that she had no recollection of Roger Stone, but in reality, she “mocked Roger Stone’s arrest.” As Posobeic notes, this possibly constitutes perjury.
Here is the Tomeka Hill's testimony in court during her

There were other questionable jurors involved in the case such as Seth Cousins who was a donor to Beto O’Rourke, a former Democratic presidential candidate.
When speaking of how the case was conducted, President Trump called it “ridiculous” and an “insult to our country.” A new trial could be a possibility for Stone’s team as new information arises. If Hart responded incorrectly to questions about her social media activity, it would help their case.
On Wednesday, CNN reported that Hart “stands with the prosecutors.”"

On Wednesday, Marie-Anna Murat, a spokesperson for the company said, “Via Rail is working with the infrastructure owner on the specifics of the resumption of service which is estimated to take at least 36 hours from the time the line is cleared.”
The company announced on Tuesday that all services from Via Rail will be cancelled from Toronto-Ottawa and Toronto-Montreal until Thursday.
The protesters have been active for many days and caused a lot of interferences with travel throughout Canada. The protests are being held to show support for those of the Wet’suwet’en Nation who do not want the pipeline to be built on their land.
The 20 elected band councils along the route of the pipeline have allowed Coastal GasLink permission to follow through with the pipeline. However, there are some hereditary chiefs who don’t want the 670-kilometer pipeline project to go through.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau touched on the subject in Senegal, saying, “We recognize the important democratic right—and we will always defend it—of peaceful protests. This is an important part of our democracy in Canada, but we are also a country of the rule of law and we need to make sure those laws are respected.”
“That’s why I am encouraging all parties to dialogue to resolve this as quickly as possible,” he said.
It has now been five days since the railway service has been active. According to Via Rail, approximately 34,000 passengers will have been inconvenienced by the 223 trains that they have had to cancel.
“We know that this unfortunate situation has an impact on our passengers travelling plans and we apologize for the inconvenience it is causing,” said Via Rail.
“We encourage them, if they need to travel in the affected areas over the next 2 days, to use alternative modes of transportation.”
Conflict began last week when the RCMP made their way into the Wet’suwet’en land attempting to stop the protesters from obstructing roadways.
Via said, “since the blockade continues near New Hazelton, B.C., normal rail activities are interrupted between Prince Rupert-Prince George, in both directions until further notice.”
The company also made it clear that they would be giving customers full refunds for their inconvenience and because of the amount of requests this could take close to ten days for some."

“I’m here in support of industry, whether it’s forestry, logging, mining and right now pipelines,” Wilson said.
“I don’t agree with the protests at all because for one thing it’s all one sided.”

The anti-pipeline protesters have been all around Canada recently. There are groups blocking ports in the Vancouver area and also protesters in construction areas for the pipeline. Many are in Ontario as well blocking freight trains and passenger trains around Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa.
“I just don’t agree with it. I think they’ve brought a lot of disruption and disunity and everything to our culture. That’s not the way the Wer’suwet’en’s operate,” said Wilson.
“We also care for the land, but we have to live a balanced lifestyle.”
Another Wet’suwet’en Nation member named Vernon Mitchell said that he is for the pipeline because it will create jobs for younger members and bring more money into the area.

High up military officials are urging the government not to allow the Chinese company a role in Canada’s 5G networks because they see the company as a threat to national security.
Trump has been warning US allies about similar concerns stating that Chinese spies could possibly gain access to secretive information. The US has told Canada that they may have to stop sharing certain intelligence information if Huawei is involved in Canada’s networks.
Within the Five Eyes network, Canada is the only nation that hasn’t made up their mind as to whether or not they will be working with the company. The US banned the company and New Zealand and Australia followed suit. Boris Johnson on the other hand decided that the UK would allow Huawei partial access to their networks.
Canadian MP Erin O’Toole is among those who have stated that they side with the Canadian military on the issue.

Canadian and Chinese relations have been rocky ever since the arrest of the company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. The arrest took place in Vancouver in 2018 after a request was made by the U.S. Since the arrest, China has locked up two Canadians—Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in Beijing. Certain agricultural imports also came to a standstill.

The Ford government says that its ultimate goal is for an open market approach to cannabis. For now, however, the PCs say a supply shortage forced the government to start off using a lottery system for limited retail licences. There are no expected changes to the cannabis framework at this time, however the Progressive Conservatives said that the most recent consultation is to understand potential decisions to create an open market in the future.
The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario has confirmed that it has already received more than 700 applications for retail operator licences which has prompted the provincial government to consider the possibility of “consumption venues” in addition to permits for special occasions such as concerts or outdoor festivals.
Ontario is dedicated to giving the private sector the freedom to build a safe and convenient retail system said Attorney General Doug Downey in a press release. This is an attempt to hopefully combat the illegal market."

He made the announcements as he continues to attempt to obtain a seat for Canada on the United Nations Security Council.
Trudeau spent three days in Ethiopia’s capital of Addis Ababa and met with many notable people from the African Union. This was the 33rd union meeting in the capital.
Trudeau also spent a fair amount of time with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia—Abiy Ahmed. After meetings between the two, they eventually went on a private tour where they walked through the Prime Minister’s residence. Abiy made no indication as to where his security council vote was leaning.
He mentioned to Trudeau that the country is thankful for the support that Canada has provided in the past.
“We Ethiopians have a deep sense of friendship to Canada,” said Abiy
Abiy received the Nobel Peace Prize last fall and is considered one of Africa’s most influential leaders.
Trudeau noted that the two countries were planning to work together more closely in the future and will soon begin to negotiate a Foreign Investment Protection Agreement.
The current trade relationship between Canada and Ethiopia has been fairly small with only $170 million traded between the countries in 2018. Over the course of the last 20 years, Ethiopia’s economy has been well on the rise and the city of Addis Ababa is growing at a fast pace.
Trudeau was involved in several other meetings mostly involving talk of economic growth opportunities but also of gender equality and climate change.
After revealing the commitment of $10 million towards the African Nations, Trudeau received support from President Zewde who is thought to be among the most powerful women in Africa. Zewde told Trudeau that she valued his “strong female policy.”
Canada is currently competing with Norway and Ireland for the two available seats.
Many of the continent’s scholars are skeptical of Trudeau and believe that he has not attempted to forge a relationship with Africa in the past and is only doing so now to receive their votes. Africa has 54 of the 193 total votes to determine the non-permanent seats of the Security Council.
The trip was the first that Trudeau has made to Ethiopia."

“Under the federal government’s current rebate structure, most households will still receive more than what they pay in fuel charges,” said Yves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer. “However, once the provincial and federal sales taxes on carbon pricing are accounted for, these amounts will be lower on a new basis when compared with the analysis in our previous report.”
Saw this yesterday, but couldn’t respond given dad’s funeral. The PBO has chosen to ignore secondary effects of the inflationary carbon tax. A quick check with Cdns on grocery prices year over year would have shown their report to be sloppy and incorrect #smartenupPBO https://t.co/Isog7DuymA— Dan McTeague (@GasPriceWizard) February 6, 2020
However, Dan McTeague, President of Canadians for Affordable Energy disagrees with the PBO’s findings. McTeague was a member of the Liberal parliament for 18 years and he held the consumer file for the Liberals during some of the years in opposition, during the Harper government. He is now the President of Canadians For Affordable Energy.
“I was a little concerned that the PBO had fallen short of what I’ve always expected them to do and that is to do a thorough review of government programs as they impact the finances as well as the efficacy of these kinds of policies and in the past I think they’ve been very reliable,” said McTeague to The Post Millennial.
“I was surprised that PBO effectively only looked at the rebate itself, and even there, what didn’t get reported was the fact that the amount of revenue to the government was certainly not neutral as many critics had said when this was imposed. It would not be revenue neutral if by virtue of the fact that the tax itself was subject to another tax,” McTeague continued.
“I denounced tax cascading when it came to fuel pricing back in 1998 on behalf of Liberals way back when in committee report I wrote to try to underscore the need for more competition, but also took a shot at our own guys on the ever-increasing windfall for governments when they impose taxes on taxes and that’s the case here. By the way that did give rise to two energy rebates back in 2001 and 2003.
“What concerned me about the PBO is that I thought it did a fairly sloppy job in terms of looking at the entire impact on consumers with respect to this carbon tax. Most specifically, two words, ‘carbon leakage’ comes to mind. There is no way that you could look at the rebate and the imposition of the tax and keep it in one silo and say, ‘Hey, you got your tax rebate and here’s what it’s going to cost you for fuel going forward.’ We know the knock-on effect of carbon taxes throughout the economy is certainly noticed by everybody, especially those of us who have to feed our kids.”
The Post Millennial also reached out to Aaron Wudrick, Federal Director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, who said, “There actually wasn’t much surprising to us in the PBO report. The legislation requires that all of the revenue be returned within the province in which it was collected.”
“What was more interesting were two things: That the benefit appears to be shrinking (i.e. the difference between the rebate and the cost is shrinking) and the amount of GST collected, which is going to be close to $300 million in a couple years. That is not being rebated and nobody seems to be talking about that part.”
“Finally, the scope of the PBO report is only on the fiscal side. The main policy objective of the carbon tax is to reduce emissions. As we have seen in BC, where emissions did not drop, it is not a slam dunk that emissions are dropping. If that persists, why exactly are they even doing this?”
McTeague also sees the carbon tax as hurting Canada’s competitiveness in a global market and Canadians wallets at checkout lines.
“I haven’t even gotten into the issue of whether or not the taxes leading to higher costs for goods in Canada that could lead to more jobs being lost and putting our import competitors at a strategic advantage over Canadian producers.”
“I think Giroux could have done a much more thorough investigation instead of this piece-meal, which I think is now being used by partisan supporters of carbon taxes to advance the notion that this is somehow a net good for Canadians. I believe, fundamentally, it isn’t and I think anybody who’s been in a grocery store would agree.”"

United Conservative Party MLA and Minister of Education Adriana LaGrange argued “there is no room” for radical activists in the classroom. Lagrange gave Extinction Rebellion as an example of the type of activists she believes have no place in schools.
NDP MLA and Women’s Issues Critic Janis Irwin responded to LaGrange’s comments saying that there is “absolutely” room for groups like the Extinction Rebellion.

Minister @AdrianaLaGrange, there is *absolutely* room for the perspectives of groups like Extinction Rebellion in our classrooms, just as there’s room for the perspectives of industry. Let me explain why. #abed #ableg https://t.co/4cqjOu7QAr— Janis Irwin (@JanisIrwin) February 6, 2020
Extinction Rebellion identifies itself as a “nonviolent civil disobedience activist movement.” It was founded in 2018 by Roger Hallam and Gail Bradbook.
The group most notably held a sizeable demonstration in London in 2019 where over 1,100 arrests were made in 11 days. BBC News reported that the protest cost police about $12.9 million.

In an article posted in Medicine Hat News, LaGrange wrote, “climate change must be taught in a way that prepares our students to address the issue rationally, not in a way that purposely seeks to cause fear and anxiety. There is no room in our classrooms for radical activists, like Extinction Rebellion, whose demands include shutting-down Alberta’s oil and gas sector by 2025.”
Irwin argued against LaGrange’s statement on Twitter saying, “When I taught social studies in very conservative parts of rural Alberta, I ensured kids were exposed to multiple perspectives. I didn’t force my beliefs on them. They didn’t leave my classroom as radical activists, but they left with a broader understanding of issues.”
A separate commenter replied to Irwin writing, “You have to be kidding here. No room for extremism in our kids classrooms. That’s why we voted the NDP out. They can be educated ‘about them’ but not ‘by’ them. Glad you are on the outside looking in.”

The Post Millennial reported earlier this week that the City of Edmonton had children take lessons from an Extinction Rebellion activist."

The mine would be located just north of Fort McMurray, Alberta and run by Teck Resources Limited. There are a lot of MPs that are adamantly opposed to such an approval as they had previously promised to operate under a more environmentally focused government during their campaigns.
This approval would mean the mine would operate for the next 41 years, covering more than 29,200 hectares and produce approximately 260,000 barrels of bitumen daily according to the Huffington Post.
Pushback from constituents was a common theme along the campaign trail after the Trudeau government approved the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project on two separate occasions. When candidates would mention the carbon tax and reducing methane emissions they were often met with comments like, “Yeah, but you guys bought a pipeline.”
“If we are truly committed to net-zero by , and to the science, and to the world, and to our future and tackling climate change,” Beaches–East York’s Nathaniel Erskine-Smith told HuffPost Canada, “there is no explanation sitting here today as to how this project fits within that commitment. So should it proceed as it stands? I think it’s a pretty easy no.”
“I think we have made significant commitments to achieve net-zero by 2050,” he said. “I think we’ve made significant commitments to achieve our Paris climate commitments. …  we have to meet those and my constituents demand that we meet those, and our grandchildren demand that we meet those.” said Pontiac MP Will Amos.
Amos pleaded with his cabinet to have “regard for the science, have regard for climate science, have regard for the science laid out quite clearly in the joint panel report.”
Joint Review Panel released a report last year that found the project would result in 7,000 jobs during its construction phase and 2,500 thereafter, as well as about $70 billion in taxes and royalties for all three levels of government. The downfall is that project would have “significant adverse environmental effects” on wildlife, wetlands and old-growth forests. Certain species affected in particular would be the Canada lynx, woodland caribou and the Ronald Lake bison herd. There are also affects to certain Indigenous groups and their land rights. The project will also make reaching Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets very difficult.
MP Jennifer O’Connell stated that the environment was the biggest concern in her riding and while she acknowledged the importance of economic growth she stated, “I just know that if we are going to be serious about climate change and hitting our emissions, then that is what we need to factor [into] any project and any policy we consider as a government.”
Don Lindsay, CEO of Teck Resources Limited, said in a press release that the company hoped to be carbon neutral by 2050 although he did not provide any details on how such a goal could be achieved. He also noted that due to the recent weak energy prices the project may not get built at all, even with federal approval.
Some Liberal MPs are still undecided such as John McKay who has been open about his uncertainty surrounding the issue. “I’m at sixes and sevens; I haven’t come around to it.”
MP Adam van Koeverden, from Milton, Ont., said he did not want to comment on the Teck mine. “I’m listening with my ears and gathering as much information as I can,” he said.
Peter Schiefke said the cabinet will take “everything under consideration.” Schiefke is the parliamentary secretary to the minister of the environment and climate change. “I think it’s a challenge, I think one of the things we have to do as a government, which we’ve pledged to Canadians, is find that balance between economic growth and environmental protection, and the decision rendered by cabinet is going to have to be one that finds that balance.”
Schiefke says he will support the cabinet whatever it decides. “I know that they’ve listened to all of us and also looked at all the options on the table in rendering that decision.”"

According to The Canadian Press, commissioner Mario Dion stated in a report that when it came to disclosing his private interests, which is required by the code of conduct, Peschisolido “chronically” failed to do so.
Dion noted that he would recommend “appropriate” sanctions be imposed by Parliament if Peschisolido was still an MP, but he lost his BC seat last fall. Now that he is no longer an MP he is not subject to the same rules.
It is required under the code that MPs file a complete confidential statement containing their private interests as well as their family’s interests. The statement must be provided to the commissioner within a 60 day period after the MP is elected. Any changes to the interests are to be reported to the commissioner within 60 days as well.
According to Dion, Peschisolido did not disclose multiple things, including a shareholders loan as well as a personal guarantee of debt. The commissioner noted that both of these were worth “well in excess of $10,000.” Peschisolido also did not divulge changes in his marital status or in his law corporation.
Dion wrote, “Given Mr. Peschisolido’s chronic failure to comply with the code’s disclosure requirements, there is no doubt in my mind I would have recommended that Parliament impose appropriate sanctions.”
The excuse that Peschisolido gave Dion was that he was focusing so much on his duties as an MP that he failed to care for certain matters regarding his law corporation. This caused him to fail to make the disclosures.
“This prompts me to emphasize how meeting all obligations under the code, including those relating to disclosure, is in fact an integral part of a member’s role,” wrote Dion, who said disclosure “is essential to helping prevent conflicts between public and private interests.”"

Middle-Class Prosperity Minister Mona Fortier said, “It is incumbent on us to be more familiar with Canadians’ needs … A lot of people are feeling the squeeze at the end of the month and need a little help to make ends meet … We still have our work cut out for us in order to strengthen the middle class.”
According to Blacklock’s, Bill C-2 was passed by Parliament last December proposing gradual hikes in personal tax exemption. The cut comes out to $90 this year which is only $1.73 per week.
Fortier told the Commons that the cut “means more money that can be used to do things like buy healthy food.”
Conservative MP Pat Kelly said, “It’s about $1.70 a week. Will that pay for groceries?”
Minister Fortier responded, “We know we still have work to do.”
New Democrat MP Peter Julian called the tax cut baffling and said, “It’s perplexing to me because it seems so out of touch with the reality so many Canadian families are facing.”
“Half of Canadian families are $200 away from insolvency at the end of every month,” he said, “People are saying $1.73 is not going to make a huge difference. That’s the figure the Parliamentary Budget Office did say was the impact this year.”
Fortier said the cut puts “more money in their pockets” and added, “It is incumbent on us to be more familiar with Canadians’ needs.”
“You know, I am looking at the middle class and we know Canadians want to have access to a good home, they want to be able to pay for education for their kids, they want a dignified and secure retirement, and they want a good job,” noted Fortier, “They have costs of living, and the middle class – it’s important to say the middle class has the reality of wanting that good place, education, and retirement. So, we can look at it that way.”
When asked what the median Canadian income is by Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre, Fortier’s reply was, “Excuse me?”
“What is the median income of Canadians today?” She said, “When we talk about Canadians and middle-class Canadians, we know that depending on where they live and depending on their realities they will have different incomes.”
Blacklock’s Reporter noted that $48,000 per year is the median income for single-parent homes in Canada while it is $68,600 for couples with children."
0,2020-02-06T08:39:26.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/senator-lynn-beyak-denies-claiming-she-was-metis,Senator Lynn Beyak denies claiming she was Metis,"Senator Lynn Beyak said yesterday that she never actually claimed to be Metis. “Media is reporting I am Métis,” Beyak wrote in a statement. “Métis are a great people but to be clear: I am not now, never was, and never will be Métis. I have never claimed to be Métis at any time, in any way, to any one, in my life.”
Nicole Meawasige was Beyak’s instructor for her anti-bias training at the Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres of Toronto. Meawasige wrote in her report dated October 16, 2019 that, “The Senator identified herself as Metis.” The report was sent to the Senate Ethics Office and went on to add, “Senator Beyak explained that her Métis identity resulted from her family’s adoption of an Indigenous child, her adopted sister. The Senator’s understanding and presentation of her Métis identity were flagged as a concern by the trainers.”
Beyak was forced to attend Federation sensitivity training last year after she posted 129 constituents’ letters on her website that included five deemed racist by the Senate Ethics Office. Among the letters were claims that First Nations were “pampered” and engaged in “chronic whining” despite that they “received better treatment and education than society gave the Irish.”
Beyak claims that this account is false. Beyak described her instructors as “unprofessional and inconsiderate”, in her own written account of those sessions, stating that one trainer, Terrellyn Fearn told her she was “white privileged.”
“She asked if I knew about the meaning of white privilege and if we could focus on that,” wrote Beyak: “Terrellyn jumped up and went to the board where she hastily drew a sweeping blue arc and jabbed a multitude of blue dots beneath. She said the blue arc indicated white privilege and the English and French takeover of their many Indigenous nations represented by the blue dots, to get the land and resources they wanted, to use for their own gain.”
“I explained while I accepted her understanding of history, mine is different and since we are both well-informed and neither of us was there, we would have to agree to disagree,” wrote Beyak.
The Senator is facing a second suspension pending a second written apology with completion of more training courses. The Senate postponed the vote on her suspension yesterday although no senator has spoken publicly in Beyak’s defence according to Blacklock’s."
0,2020-02-06T07:49:40.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/wind-turbine-blades-mostly-heading-to-landfills,Wind turbine blades mostly heading to landfills,"Tens of thousands of wind turbine blades are being taken down from their towers and brought to landfills across the US and Europe. The aging blades have been built to withstand hurricane-forces and as a result cannot be easily recycled, repurposed or crushed down. The blades must be first sawed into three pieces, small enough to be strapped to a flatbed eighteen-wheeler. A wind turbine’s blade is close in size to the wing of a Boeing 747 and sometimes larger, according to Bloomberg.
In the US about 8,000 blades will be removed annually over the next four years. In Europe, there will be about 3,800 coming down annually until 2022, according to BloombergNEF. They predict the problem is going to get worse as the installations of today are five times the size as the blades that are being recycled from the last decade.
There are a handful of landfills across America currently accepting them. Bob Cappadona is the chief operating officer for the North American unit of Paris-based Veolia Environnement SA.
“The wind turbine blade will be there, ultimately, forever,” he said. The company is searching for better ways to deal with the blades disposal. “Most landfills are considered a dry tomb. The last thing we want to do is create even more environmental challenges.”
Wind energy is one of the cheapest ways to use clean energy. Electricity is generated by the turbine blades that spin to power the generators. During the 1973 Arab oil embargo western countries were compelled to invent modern models of wind power in order to find an alternative to fossil fuels. New Hampshire was the first state to install a wind farm in 1980, California followed shortly after.
The US Congress passed a tax credit in 1992 to help manufacturers solve the problem of expensive and inefficient models, that at that time were spinning fast and low. Models were then redesigned to be much taller and more powerful.
Wind power is carbon-free and the majority of the turbine’s materials, about 85 percent are able to be recycled or reused with the exception of the blades. Some fibreglass blades are as long as a football field. Scientists are working to extract what resins from fibres they can in hopes of reusing some of the material in the future. In Europe, the blades are often burned in kilns but burning the fibreglass emits pollutants.
“We can process 99.9 percent of a blade and handle about 6,000 to 7,000 blades a year per plant,” said Global Fibreglass Solutions chief executive officer Don Lilly. “When we start to sell to more builders, we can take in a lot more of them. We’re just gearing up.”
Municipal and commercial landfills will continue to take the bulk of the waste until Fibreglass Solutions becomes more established. It is currently the safest and cheapest solution according to the American Wind Energy Association in Washington.
“Wind turbine blades at the end of their operational life are landfill-safe, unlike the waste from some other energy sources, and represent a small fraction of overall US municipal solid waste,” the group released in an email."

As Stephen Kruiser put it in a PJ Media morning briefing following Trump’s third State of the Union address Tuesday night, “The president’s speech hit more high notes than the Vienna Boys’ Choir during a Christmas program practice.”
Amongst the highlights: “The years of economic decay are over…we have shattered the mentality of American decline… our economy is the best it has ever been… Our borders are secure. … We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, colour, religion, and creed… 7 million new jobs—5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration…unemployment rate under my Administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country…African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.… women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.” And so forth.
Whether or not Trump exaggerated his accomplishments, there was enough truth to justify a victory lap, and he did so in soaring, eloquent rhetoric. Of course, he didn’t write the speech, but his direction guided its themes and its mood. The man is in love with the American Dream. Of course, it isn’t a fully recognized dream, and sure, we all knew we were complicit in sentimentality by giving in to the buoyancy of it all, but isn’t extolling a half-recognized dream better than ramming a nightmare down American throats, as has become the habit of the left for more than six decades?
Trump was betting his relentlessly optimistic pitch, not to mention frequent references to God and the sanctity of life, would go down well with his base, especially Evangelical Christians. But he was shrewd enough to reckon—accurately, I believe—that his God-talk and sanctity-of-life allusions would not offend ordinary Americans, who find God-talk perfectly benign, whatever their beliefs, and are appalled by such obscenities as late-term abortion. He might not have gained new votes from the left in tipping his hat to social conservatives, but he may have scored a hit with some normally passive centrists troubled by rapidly disintegrating cultural norms.
His choice of guests—a beautifully diverse group on so many levels, including those beloved of leftists – was inspired, showcasing in their lived experience the ambitions, love of democracy, attitudes to adversity, grace under pressure, belief in redemption, and muscular patriotism that represent American life at its best, even when coping with life at its most challenging:
a single black mom who wants to get her gifted daughter out of a failing public school and into one that will encourage her creativity;
the democratically elected leader of Venezuela’s National Assembly Juan Guaido (whom even the Dems stood and applauded for);
a military widow and her son whose husband had been killed in Iraq by a roadside bomb provided by the late, Trump-whacked arch-terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani;
the brother of a man murdered by an illegal alien with many previous crimes on his rap sheet, but who was at large because of California’s sanctuary-state policy (Trump intends to legislate a policy giving victims of such crimes the right to sue states on sanctuary-policy grounds);
the ambitious young grandson of a remarkable black Air Force pilot, also honoured;
a long-serving border patrol agent;
a black Army veteran of Afghanistan suffering from PTSD who struggled with addiction and triumphed over it;
the parents of  Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian aid worker in Syria, captured, enslaved and murdered by ISIS;
the youngest U.S. baby (21 weeks gestation) ever to survive and thrive, with her joyous mother;
Venezuela’s top cop, imprisoned for protecting protesters, now a U.S. immigrant; the brother of a teenager goaded to suicide by cyber bullies;
the family of a military man on his fourth deployment, away eight months, reunited (a surprise to his wife) at the SOTU.
Also inspired was the decision to award cancer-stricken Rush Limbaugh the Medal of Freedom, presented by Melania Trump. It was an emotional moment for the popular radio host. Limbaugh’s hard-line conservatism may be anathema to liberals, but the smart ones understand that respect is due to the host of the most beloved long-term radio show in the U.S., with an estimated 27 million listeners per week, who may not have very long to live.
Symbols are so important on these occasions, are they not?
Speaking of which, no response to the SOTU address would be complete without a word about House Leader Nancy Pelosi’s unbelievably dumb gesture at the end of the speech. With the camera still steady on a radiantly happy Trump and her, plainly visible behind him, she ripped the pages of his speech in half.
Whatever possessed her? Had she already planned to do it before she arrived? Hard to believe that with time to consider, such a seasoned politician wouldn’t see the obvious danger of unintended consequences inherent in that symbolic act. Or was it Trump’s insulting refusal to shake her proffered hand before the speech that triggered her ill-considered thirst for revenge? Even then, she had a full hour to contemplate the gesture’s attendant risk.
Whatever, Pelosi’s “Nantrum” (thanks, witty tweeter) is the meme that will live in infamy. Trump was wrong to ignore her hand, but that was only an insult to her personally – or perhaps to her party. Tearing up the speech was an insult not only to Trump and Republicans, but to his guests. And in any case, there is no tit-for-tat possible here, because the expression implies that Trump and Pelosi are peers. They are not. He is the duly elected president of the United States. She is a party appointee, not even a candidate for president.
Pelosi does represent her party on such ritual occasions, and if there were some of her colleagues present who thought the tearing was a brave gesture, there had to be others who closed their eyes in mortification. They would be the ones who immediately understood that many Americans, a lot of them undecided, would see the gesture as an offence to the office of the presidency. After all, she had gotten a dig in by refusing to intone the usual introduction with the words “honour” and “privilege,” so she had already riposted the handshake refusal. I’m pretty sure Pelosi handed Trump a significant number of votes with that moment of uncontainable malice.
Never a dull moment in American politics, eh? Even without impeachment dramas, an Iowa primary disaster and a SOTU spat meme gone viral, it’s a circus like no other."

The tax cut in question would return $90 to Canadians annually or the equivalent of $1.73 a week. This suggestion comes from the office of Minister of Middle Class Prosperity according to Blacklock’s.
“We are lowering taxes for middle-class families and people working hard to join them, which means more money that can be used to do things like buy healthy food, send kids to camp,” Fortier told the Commons January 31. “This is just the next step in our plan to make life more affordable for middle-class Canadians.”
One reporter asked Minister Fortier how the cut spreads out over time, “What’s that per paycheque?”
“Well, you know, it will help,” replied Fortier. “Well, it’s still money,” the Minister earlier told reporters. “It will help families cover some costs, that they want to send their kids to camp or put money aside for retirement.”
Bill C-2 An Act For Granting To Her Majesty Certain Sums Of Money was passed in Parliament last December and it raised the basic personal exemption for Canadian taxpayers from $12,298 to $15,000 a year by 2023. Once the $15,000 exemption is reached, it is predicted that said individuals would save approximately $300 a year according to the finance department.
“We know that will have an important impact,” said Finance Minister Bill Morneau. “It’s a very significant measure.”
Not everyone is impressed, including MP Pat Kelly, deputy Conservative finance critic for Calgary Rocky Ridge. “The government is trying to get extraordinary credit for what is really a very modest tax cut,” said Kelly. “It’s a tax cut, and I support cutting taxes for Canadians, but this isn’t going to help Canadians get ahead anywhere near to the extent this government is claiming.”
“The budget resembles marketing documents rather than giving Canadians accurate and clear information about what the government actually plans to do,” said Kelly. They have got Robin Hood backwards,” said MP Peter Julian (New Westminster-Burnaby, B.C.), told the Commons. “The Liberals are taking from the poor and giving it to the rich.”

Beyak is looking at potential suspension after failing to complete her anti-racism training from the Red Chamber. Beyak was forced to undergo anti-racism training after publicly defending residential schools.
The details of Beyak’s training sessions have been released by the Senate’s ethics committee. The program was through the Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres and took place in the fall of 2019.
Initially, Beyak was expected to attend a three-day course of Indigenous “cultural competency training.” However, on her first day she claimed that she had Indigenous heritage due to her parents adoption which did not sit well with the OFIFC according to their report.
“Beyak explained that her Metis identity resulted from her family’s adoption of an Indigenous child (her adopted sister). The senator’s understanding and presentation of her Metis identity were flagged as a concern by the trainers … and by other participants,” said Nicole Meawasige, the training coordinator, in her email to the Senate ethics committee.
Manitoba Metis Federation President David Chartrand called the claim a “weird and strange sudden pronouncement” of Metis ancestry and said that it was offensive, according to CBC.
“I want to say in the strongest terms possible that even if she were Metis, the Metis Nation would disavow all of the discriminatory statements and actions that have come from this senator,” he said. “We deplore the way Senator Beyak has tried to say that it’s OK for her to publish racist comments because she claims to be Metis. Stay away from our nation. Identity theft is a crime.”
Beyak failed to complete her first lesson because of her “inflexibility and conduct made the learning environment unsafe,” said the trainers’ report which was then sent to Senate Ethics Officer Pierre Legault. The OFIFC then asked Beyak to leave the premises the report said.
Beyak’s lawyer is disputing the claim that she was asked to leave the premises calling the statement “untrue” in a letter to Officer Legault.
“Anyone who knows Sen. Beyak and her polite manner would immediately be suspicious of such an accusation,” he wrote.
He criticized the report of her training sessions as a “dilatory personal attack” calling the OFIFC “disorganized” and “unprofessional” in the manner with which it dealt with the senator.
This marks the second time that the Senate ethics committee recommended that Beyak be suspended from the upper house because of her failed attempt to take her anti-racism training seriously. They also cited the fact that she offered an insufficient apology after posting anti-Indigenous letters on her Senate website. The vote for her suspension will take place this coming week.
Beyak also told her trainers that there is no racism in northwestern Ontario prior to being asked to leave."

“If you’re a distributor of content in Canada and obviously if you’re a very small media organization the requirement probably wouldn’t be the same if you’re Facebook, or Google. There would have to be some proportionality embedded into this,” Guilbeault told Evan Solomon an interview on CTV’s Question Period.
“We would ask that they have a licence, yes,” Guilbeault continued.
Attempting to curtail freedom of speech and access to information under the veil of “regulation and licensing” is undemocratic and offends Canadian constitutional values.

This past week a panel of broadcast experts tabled a list of 97 proposals—a report called the “Canada’s Communications Future: Time To Act”—to the Trudeau government that included the recommendation that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) or another regulatory body control licencing of all companies creating “audio, audiovisual, and alphanumeric news content”.
The Trudeau government has already picked favourites in the Canadian news sector by offering a $600 million bailout to the industry, which allowed eight special interest groups tied to the legacy media to decided which companies would be eligible for the taxpayer money.
“No, a free democracy does not require the press to obtain a government licence,” said Globe and Mail columnist Andrew Coyne in response to Sunday’s news.
All you needed to say was “no,” minister. No, a free democracy does not require the press to obtain a government licence…

Guilbeault also told CTV’s Solomon that the government was taking their time deliberating what 97 recommendations to adopt and hasn’t committed to anything yet.
The Trudeau government also appears to be set to force streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime to pay tax and create and stream a set quota of Canadian content.
“As far as the GST or PST, depending where you are in the country, is concerned, it’s about fairness. Companies aren’t paying PST or GST in Canada, and there’s no reason that the wealthiest companies in the world who are operating on Canadian soil shouldn’t pay for it,” said Guilbeault in the CTV interview. “
And as for asking them to do their fair share to contribute to Canadian cultural content, I mean you were talking about Netflix. Well last year Netflix spent around a billion dollars in Canada. And what we would be asking them to do, what the panel is recommending and what we have said as a government many times before, is that they take part of that money and invest it in the development of and the distribution of Canadian cultural content.”
The list of 97 proposals also includes having the CBC—notoriously known for not crediting other journalists’ work and for pushing Trudeau government propaganda—monitor and police other news outlets’ content."

“Our government’s top priority is keeping Canadians safe. Too often, Canadians experience firsthand the devastating impact that gun violence has on our communities. We must take decisive action to strengthen gun control. That includes ending the proliferation of military-style assault rifles in Canada,” Blair’s spokesperson told The Post Millennial.
The proposed gun ban has received heavy backlash as over 141,000 Canadians have signed an official parliamentary petition that’s opposing the ban. The petition is now the most signed official petition in Canadian history.
“We will not bring back the long-gun registry, and we will not target guns designed for hunting. Hunters, farmers, and law-abiding recreational gun owners will be treated with fairness and respect as we work together to keep our communities safe,” Blair’s spokesperson continued.
“In the last mandate, we invested $327 million to give police and prosecutors new resources and tools to fight gang-related violence and address gun smuggling. We also brought in legislation that ensures stronger background checks.
“In this new mandate, we will take further steps to address gun violence, including strengthening our border, giving cities the ability to ban or restrict handguns, and doing even more to tackle gang violence.
“We will be announcing details of our government’s agenda on firearms in the near future, which will come as each step is ready to be implemented.”
The Post Millennial reached out to Tracey Wilson, who is a gun rights advocate from the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights. She was not convinced by the public safety minister’s spokesperson’s words.
“They never did release all that funding … but they did promise it. It’s a drop in the bucket compared to what they will waste buying legal guns out of the locked safes of licensed Canadian gun owners.”
Nicely done @RaquelDancho !!! Thank you!! https://t.co/O23OlurZMt— Tracey Wilson (@TWilsonOttawa) January 31, 2020
“There is zero evidence that these measures like gun bans will reduce gun violence. It is noted that they have yet to actually define what their ‘version’ of an ‘assault rifles’ is,” said Wilson.
“The standard, internationally-accepted definition saw a ban of those in 1978. This is simply political theatre to appease an aggressive anti-gun lobby movement in Canada, and continue to cop out of working on actual crime, instead targeting legal owners.”
“If there is legitimacy to gun bans, then let’s debate that democratically by utilizing the appropriate method of legislation rather than an OIC.”

The petition against the gun ban has been open since Dec. 17, 2019 and will close on Feb. 15 2020.

Trudeau’s trip to India was marred by what seemed to be endless photo-ops of him in costume. New documents unearthed By Global reveal that one more photo-op had been planned that never came to fruition.
Indian Prime Minister Nahendra Modi, Trudeau and his wife Sophie, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and some Bollywood celebrities were scheduled to do a public yoga session.
It was to be an hour-long yoga session at dawn, with television cameras and press to boot, that would take place at Humayan’s Tomb in Delhi. The tomb is from the 16th century and is one of India’s most important cultural treasures.
Referred to as the “Yoga Summit”, it was cancelled just before Trudeau left Canada, however.
Prime Minister Nahendra Modi, an avid yoga enthusiast wanted to do the yoga session in an attempt to improve Canada-India relations, according to the detailed to page note prepared for Trudeau. Modi begins his day with a one-hour session.
“Promoting yoga globally has been a soft power priority for Prime Minister Modi,” bureaucrats wrote in a briefing note for Trudeau.
A copy of the briefing was included in the 300-page briefing book given to Freeland so she could prepare to accompany Trudeau on the trip. The briefing book was eventually granted to Global News nearly two years after it had been requested, however much of it had been redacted by bureaucrats.
The United Nations General Assembly declared June 21 the annual International Day of Yoga which was under the guidance of Modi back in 2015
It was believed that the morning yoga session involving the two prime ministers would be useful as an event to “demonstrate people-to-people ties through sports” and “deepen [the] relationship with Prime Minister Modi through sharing his personal love for yoga and supporting India’s yoga cultural diplomacy.”"

“There was a mourning period of people from July when we made the announcement,” said Violet MacLeod, a spokesperson for Sobeys Inc.
“We did hear a lot of nostalgia, a lot of, ‘What will I put in my boots?’ … but we’ve had six months go by and people are accepting the change.”
Sobey’s first made the announcement back in July of 2019 from all 255 locations. There are officially the first nation-wide grocery store to take such action. This simple action will eliminate the production of 225 million plastic bags a year, according to CBC.
“It’s important for us to step up and listen to what Canadians have been asking for and work to reduce that avoidable plastic and this plastic bag elimination is just a first step on that journey,” said MacLeod.
Currently Canadians go through approximately 15 billion plastic bags annually according to the government. Trudeau announced announced a nationwide ban on single use plastics last year that is to be implemented by 2021. This would include bags, straws, and cutlery among other things.
The first province to ban the use of plastic bags was Prince Edwards Island followed by Newfoundland and Nova Scotia with plans to have full implementation by the end of the year. Vancouver has also brought in the ban to take effect in 2021 as well as Prince Albert, Saskatchewan approved the ban this week which will begin Aug. 1.
In lieu of the plastic bag ban, paper bags will be the most sustainable option according to MacLeod. Consumers in Quebec are encouraged to bring reusable containers for their shopping needs.
Some stores, such as Walmart have been charing customer five cents to reduce customers use of them as far back as 2016. The company said that the surcharge resulted in 50 per cent less people using plastic bags since. They project that number will be eradicated completely by 2025.
Loblaws released a statement saying it’s en route to reducing the plastic packaging of its products as well, in addition to the selling of plastic bags. Some of their individual locations have made the decision to remove plastic bags altogether."

He made the decision despite the U.S. asking Britain not to include the company in the next-generation communications for fears that they will have too much access to sensitive information.
According to CBC, Johnson has decided that Huawei can only access “non-sensitive” information and can only have 35 percent involvement in the 5G network.
The company would not have access to the core of networks or any sensitive locations like military bases according to the British government.
Donald Trump and the U.S. administration will not be content with the decision as they fear the company could be used by China to access secret information. The U.S. said that they would possibly reduce intelligence cooperation with London.
The new 5G network with its unprecedented speeds is said to be among the largest innovations since the internet was introduced.
After a meeting led by Johnson, Nicky Morgan, the British Communications Secretary said, “This is a U.K.-specific solution for U.K.-specific reasons and the decision deals with the challenges we face right now.”
Cybersecurity officials in Britain have noted that Huawei is always handled as a “high risk” business.
The White House has not yet responded to the actions taken by Johnson.
On Tuesday Huawei’s vice-president, Victor Zhang said, “Huawei is reassured by the U.K. government’s confirmation that we can continue working with our customers to keep the 5G roll-out on track.”
“This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future. It gives the U.K. access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market.”
Huawei has claimed that the U.S. does not want the company in Britain because they cannot compete as Huawei is the largest producer of telecom equipment in the world.
Within the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, Canada is the only country that has not decided whether to work with Huawei on 5G networks.
As Canada continues its rocky relationship with China, things remain uncertain. Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou has finished the first stage of extradition hearing but China still has two Canadians detained.
The U.S. has claimed that as the 5G networks grow and evolve, Huawei’s access to different parts of the network will be harder to monitor."

The Conservative leadership candidate mentioned that he applied to organizers of the parade asking to join.
If MacKay is successful in gaining permission to join the parade and is able to win the conservative leadership, he will become the first and only permanent federal leader of the Conservatives to be a part of the LGBTQ rights parade.
“Pride parades are important,” he said.
“We live in a world where sexual orientation and gender identity are still used by tyrants and bigots to belittle and oppress. In Canada we are lucky to have a society that has grown more tolerant, more accepting and more understanding, but there is still more work to be done,” CBC reported MacKay saying.
MacKay is considered the front runner in the leadership race, according to recent polls.
In the past, MacKay has been more welcoming to same-sex marriage than other Conservatives. He voted against a Conservative resolution to define marriage as it was traditionally defined in a 2006 vote.
MacKay assumed he would be criticized by some conservatives for the decision.
In a statement he said, “The fact that some will condemn this statement speaks louder than any argument I could make about the importance for the next leader of the Conservative Party of Canada to follow in the footsteps of Rona Ambrose, and march in support of pride.”
Andrew Scheer did not participate in any of these types of events during the time he spent in the party.
Mackay referred to this saying that Scheer could not “deftly deal” with these types of issues.
He said that issues such as same-sex marriage “hung around Andrew Scheer’s neck like a stinking albatross, quite frankly.”
Among the provincial Conservatives who have participated in such events is Ontario Premier Doug Ford. He marched in the York Region Pride Parade."

One CBC headline recently read, “Animal rights activists decry Ontario bill that would limit farm protests“. That’s true, it would do that, but there are reasons for not allowing protesters to trespass that don’t seem unreasonable to reasonable people.
One paragraph in the article reads, “An offender could be fined as much as $25,000, a significant hike from the current $10,000 maximum under the Trespass to Property Act.” The $25,000 fine only comes into play for people who are reoffenders, a detail worth mentioning.
The problem here, as far as I can see, is that the animal rights activists are expressing their right to free speech but what muddles this is that the location that they’re expressing it is private property, and furthermore, someone’s home. Farming isn’t your typical occupation, it doesn’t abide by a regular schedule. It’s a lifestyle.
The land you work is also your home, most farmers houses are a stone’s throw from their barn. A cow may calve in the middle of the night, a storm may take out a fence or a coyote may get into the chicken coop. Farmers choose to be farmers, they don’t just fall into it.
In any major industry there will always be a few bad apples, but the majority of farmer’s take pride in what they do, and proper sanitation for animals is a big part of that. The issue with animal rights activists is that their concern has little do with sanitation or practices but with the concept of livestock itself. The fact that they don’t want anyone to consume meat or animal byproducts keeps means they’ll never be pleased until the farms are completely shut down. They also don’t seem to go after the giant corporate factory farms that supply to McDonald’s and their counterparts but rather, medium scale, honest, hardworking family farms.
Another issue is that you can’t reason with someone that has no respect for what you do. I’d be willing to bet my last buck that no activist drives all the way from Toronto up to some farm in rural Ontario only to say, “Actually gang, we think this farm looks pretty good. Although these hogs will eventually go to slaughter, their living conditions are pretty tranquil and the farmer does seem to have an innate appreciation for his livestock. Pack it up folks, I guess we missed the mark on this one.”
Nope.
Many activists view these farmers as mass murderers. Harvesting an animal is akin to murdering a human, according to their signs. This makes it very difficult to find some common ground and civility, particularly after they’ve trespassed onto your home to begin with. I’m all for free speech, all the way, but it should be exercised within a public space. I think there is nothing wrong with animal rights activists protesting in a town square and voicing their message online, but once you show up onto someone’s property with hidden cameras and the intent to destroy their livelihood, it’s obviously going to end poorly, for everybody. Property rights matter too.
If somebody wanted to bring back Prohibition because alcohol is quite damaging to one’s health there would be a fundamental difference between them protesting in the street and storming the doors of a microbrewery. Protestors often damage property when they arrive at people’s farms, so much so that section 15 of Bill 156 would require restitution for damaged property on behalf of the protestor(s). Section 15 is a direct response to this being an ongoing problem.
Bill 156, as far as I can tell, is less about silencing protestors and more about protecting farmers and their families from inexcusable and illegal behaviour from the animal rights activist mob."

CBC has reported that the change was made public in the 2019 Albertan budget as well as by letters recently mailed by the government.
The letter says, “To ensure the government can continue to provide this program to our province’s seniors and to keep Alberta’s health system sustainable, the government is changing the eligibility criteria for the program.”
According Health Minister Tyler Shandro’s spokesperson, Steve Buick, the seniors program is the largest drug program in Alberta. The program costs approximately $600 million annually.
“The Seniors [Benefit] Drug Program is for seniors—not for non-seniors. No other province covers non-seniors through a seniors’ drug program,” wrote Buick.
Buick says that dropping the coverage of dependents who are under the age of 65 is estimated to save Alberta about $36.5 million annually.
He noted that the number of Albertans currently using the program as dependants is about 46,000.
Heather Waldie is among the Albertans who will no longer receive coverage starting in march.
Waldie is an Edmonton resident and has Stage 4 breast cancer. Her cancer treatment requires costly drugs that the government has covered until now but that coverage will end in March.
“My coverage is ending because I’m 63. I’m under 65. My husband is over 65, but with the new eligibility criteria I am no longer eligible for drug coverage,” Waldie told CBC. “My future is very uncertain because I have ongoing treatment. So it’s a stressor.”
Waldie showed up to an NDP news conference to share her objections towards the program which she described as “absolute hogwash.”
“This affects 46,000 Albertans who have contributed to life in Alberta, who want to contribute as they live their lives. Billions of dollars have been given away in tax cuts to corporations,” she said.
“I think this is completely affordable by this government, but they are choosing to cut valuable programs that preserve the health and well-being of Albertans who have built this province. I think it’s outrageous.”
Waldie planned her retirement from a career in teaching with the benefit program in mind.
She said, “Seniors are part of a family household, and codependents, so it’s a family budget. You hurt one member of a family unit, you’re hurting everybody in that family unit.”
The option that the government has suggested is applying for non-group Blue Cross coverage for Albertans losing their benefits."

He is touring internationally to gain support from other countries and take the upper hand over Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s current socialist party leader.
Guaido’s trip outside of Venezuela has not been permitted by the country’s Supreme Court, who sides with Maduro. As one of the countries supporting Guaido’s efforts to take power, Prime Minister Trudeau and senior cabinet ministers will be meeting with him today.
In a statement, Trudeau said, “I commend Interim President Guaido for the courage and leadership he has shown in his efforts to return democracy to Venezuela, and I offer Canada’s continued support.”
Guaido and Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister took questions in Ottawa at 11:30 a.m. ET.
Over 50 countries acknowledge Guaido as the interim President, considering Maduro’s reelection to be illegitimate. Guaido is head of congress for the South American nation.
Sanctions have been imposed against some of Maduro’s government officials by Canada who is one of five nations who believe Maduro should be handled by the International Criminal Court.
Maduro still has the majority of control throughout Venezuela regardless of the support that Guaido has received from other countries.

He recently travelled to Davos for the World Economic Forum last week where he met with activist Greta Thunberg.
Upon his arrival, he drove an electric Jaguar car to the Swiss resort where the convention was being held. Prince Charles gave a speech on Wednesday in which he urged world leaders to take “bold and imaginative action” when it comes to their environmental practices according to the Daily Mail.

It was an appearance and a speech that didn’t corroborate very well with the Prince’s lifestyle. The Ministry of Supply revealed that in just the 11 days leading up to the convention Prince Charles took three flights on private jets and one additional flight via private helicopter for the purpose of official government business.
The Paramount Business Jet calculator, a program that allows passengers to understand and calculate their carbon emissions tallied that the air travel of those 11 days alone amounted to 162 metric tons of carbon emissions. That is 18 times the amount that the average Brit uses a year, and it cost approximately 270,000 British Pounds.
Clarence House spokesman said, “Global travel is an inescapable part of the Prince’s role as a senior member of the Royal Family representing the UK overseas.
“When he travels he does so at the request of the British Government. He does not choose the destinations any more than he chooses the means by which the journeys are undertaken.”
A source from within the Royal circle defended the Prince saying, “The Prince has been campaigning against the dangers of global warming for 50 years. As soon as there is a more efficient way of travelling, bearing in mind all the factors involved, he’ll be the first to adopt them.”
However, Muna Suleiman, of Friends Of The Earth, said: ‘Climate targets can’t be met without cutting pollution from aviation emissions, and private jets are a particularly wasteful way to travel.’’
Prince Charles had a Bombardier Global Express fly 944 miles from Austria to pick him up from his Birkhall home in Scotland. He was then flown to Muscat, where he paid his respects to the departed Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said on behalf of the Queen. He then flew 750 miles by private jet from Scotland to Switzerland for the Davos summit days later.
Following the speech, he travelled 1,740 miles to Israel. A private jet was chosen for security reasons and the Prince only accepted the Davos invitation because it was on the way to Israel according to Royal officials."

Andre Latreille, the department’s mental health ombudsman wrote, “Many employees are afraid to speak openly about their situation in the workplace.” he added, “The confidential meetings helped them to explore potential situations.”
The number of managers that have been demoted for misconduct remains unknown but Latreille wrote in his 2019 Annual Report To The Deputy Minister, “Based on feedback from the ombudsman and on other information, senior management decided to terminate the acting assignments of employees in positions of authority because of conduct considered inappropriate by subordinates.”
Amongst the complaints listed are “favouritism, unfairness and lack of transparency in staffing” in department offices nationwide, he said: “Various employees across Canada expressed their frustration regarding staffing decisions that lacked transparency. Employees perceive favouritism in staffing, while others have even reported nepotism.”
“The favouritism and nepotism reported by some employees violate the principles of fairness and transparency in staffing and undermine trust in the organization,” said the report. Ombudsman Latreille also cited complaints of “psychological harassment” by supervisors including “denigration, shouting, badmouthing, gossip and offensive remarks.”
There weren’t any detailed examples included nor any names of managers who had provenly hired friends or relatives.
The Public Service Commission conducted a 2018 Staffing and Non-Partisanship Survey and found that 54 percent of federal employees said that the hiring in their office “depends on who you know.” The survey questioned 101,892 employees.
A total of 31 percent of people said that the people hired in their work units were incompetent while 16 percent strongly agreed that “people hired in my work unit can do the job.” There was only a small, 14 percent who strongly agreed that promotions were fair.
Greg Phillips, national president of the Canadian Association of Professional Employees said, “It if often unclear why a person has been screened out of a process.” In a 2018 testimony at the Commons government operations committee, he said, “It has resulted in a deep distrust of the process. Employees remain fearful to speak out or file a complaint.”
Christ Aylward, national president of the Public Service Alliance of Canada testified as well saying, “It comes down to who you know, and it’s not necessarily the best-qualified person getting those jobs. Our members see that. They see it in virtually every staffing position.”
“Managers don’t have to hire the most qualified candidate, only the candidate they think is best,” said Aylward: “This has created the potential for abuse, and certainly the perception of abuse.”"

While Bernie himself is enjoying the support of the man behind the most popular podcast in existence, The Joe Rogan Experience, the old socialist democrat’s erstwhile allies are less keen on seeing their favoured candidate rub shoulders with a figure they’ve made no shortage of attempts to cancel.
“I think I'll probably vote for Bernie… He’s been insanely consistent his entire life. He’s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.” -Joe Rogan pic.twitter.com/fuQP0KwGGI— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 23, 2020
The woke left, who are largely supporters of Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic candidates, have taken to condemning Rogan for over his past decisions to platform problematic figures like Milo Yiannopoulos, as well as statements he’s made that don’t fit in with their narrow vision of political correctness.
Feminist author Sady Doyle was among the first to chime in with complaints about Rogan’s supposed sins.
“Joe Rogan also had friendly interviews with Milo Yiannopolous & Jordan Peterson, yelled, “you’re a fucking man” on-air about a trans woman, vocally argued against allowing trans kids puberty blockers THIS YEAR, says “f*g,” and believes the world is stacked against men, so,” she wrote. “Enjoy.”
Joe Rogan also had friendly interviews with Milo Yiannopolous & Jordan Peterson, yelled ""you're a fucking man"" on-air about a trans woman, vocally argued against allowing trans kids puberty blockers THIS YEAR, says ""f*g,"" and believes the world is stacked against men, so. Enjoy. https://t.co/X1oFy71elf— Sady Doyle (@sadydoyle) January 24, 2020
As I’ve pointed out on Twitter, Rogan’s 2015 interview with Milo led to his fall from grace.
Rogan’s numerous interviews with Jordan Peterson humanized and popularized the clinical psychologist, whose book, 12 Rules for Life, is credited by left-leaning writer Iman Amrani—for pulling young men away from the margins of society. It’s curious how Rogan is now being cancelled for doing what amounts to a good deed.
Doyle’s other points are equally easy to debunk: Rogan’s supposed outburst about a “trans woman” is a misrepresentation of his opposition to trans athletes who compete unfairly against women in professional sports. And as for giving kids puberty blocks? Volumes of teenagers would agree with Rogan’s views on the matter. Countless transgender teens are publicly detransitioning, as Blaire White documented for The Post Millennial.
The feminist writer was joined by the Human Rights Campaign’s Charlotte Clymer, who condemned Bernie’s endorsement of Rogan. Clymer picked apart language composed by Sanders’ national press secretary, who attempted to address the complaints over the podcast host’s supposedly dangerous views.
This is a pathetic response and I’m done. It is clear the Bernie Sanders campaign does not care about holding transphobia accountable, among the many other awful things Joe Rogan has perpetuated on his program.

I am a human being and a trans person. I am not “another belief”. https://t.co/QCwpRCDb09— Charlotte Clymer???? (@cmclymer) January 24, 2020
Former Vox host and censorious leftist Carlos Maza, whose claim to infamy revolved around his attempts to ban Steven Crowder from YouTube, was equally offended by the Rogan endorsement. Referring to him as an “incredibly influential bigot,” Maza once again reverted to calls of censorship by demanding Democrats “marginalize” Rogan instead of accepting his endorsement.
Bernie’s campaign cutting a campaign ad with Joe Rogan fucking sucks. Rogan is an incredibly influential bigot and Democrats should be marginalizing him.— Carlos Maza ? (@gaywonk) January 24, 2020
CNN political contributor Joan Walsh condemned Sanders for accepting the endorsement over Rogan’s belief in theories surrounding the murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich.
Sorry, Joe Rogan is also a Seth Rich truther. That cruelty and insanity is a dealbreaker for me: https://t.co/lhVFLRMN4c— Joan Walsh (@joanwalsh) January 24, 2020
Not everyone on the left is on board with the cries of outrage, however. The Young Turks’ Ana Kasparian took up the defence of Sanders, noting that “all the ‘woke’ and easily outraged (at progressives) feminists” were more eager to conduct acts of purity policing instead of going against Democratic establishment candidates who support overturning Roe v. Wade.
Relevant for everyone attacking Bernie over @joerogan endorsement. Words from a podcast host vs. Dem establishment propping up Dems who want to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Vox editor-in-chief Ezra Klein also appeared as a voice of reason, stating that Bernie’s strength was his ability to win over voters skeptical of the Democratic establishment.
Bernie’s strength is that he can win over some voters who are skeptical of Democrats – like Joe Rogan. If you think getting Trump out of office is actually important, that’s a good thing, and he should lean into it.— Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) January 24, 2020
On the centre and right, libertarians and conservatives alike mocked the woke brigade’s condemnations of Sanders and Rogan. Posting on Twitter, libertarian commentator and video game host Colin Moriarty pointed out that Democrats condemning Sanders were more eager to lose elections than accept the endorsement of someone so influential.
Democrats want to lose the election to Trump so badly they can’t even accept kind words from Joe Rogan, one of the nicest men on the planet.— Colin Moriarty (@notaxation) January 24, 2020
Conservative host and Daily Wire editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro made similar points.
For the Woke Police, it is far more disqualifying for Bernie that he just touted the endorsement of @joerogan, a person who says biological sex exists, than that Bernie has endorsed every communist regime of the last several decades and campaigns with anti-Semites.— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) January 24, 2020
Independent journalist Tim Pool, who identifies as a leftist, pointed out that due to purity policing on the left, “there is no right way to be ‘left’ anymore.”
Joe Rogan says hes likely going to vote for Bernie and the left attacks him and Bernie over it

Politics flows in one direction

If Joe said he was for Trump they'd call him a Nazi

Soros said that Facebook has nothing stopping it from circulating disinformation. Soros is a billionaire investor and philanthropist.
At the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Soros said, “I think there is a kind of informal mutual assistance operation or agreement developing between Trump and Facebook,” he added, “Facebook will work together to re-elect Trump, and Trump will work to protect Facebook so that this situation cannot be changed and it makes me very concerned about the outcome for 2020.”
The National Post noted that Soros did not back up his claims with any evidence. A spokesman for Facebook, Andy Stone responded to the claims saying, “This is just plain wrong.”
Soros has previously made similar accusations against the company during a Davos speech in 2018. He said that Facebook treats its users in a similar way that gambling companies do when they get their users hooked.
Facebook has been accused of shady business by many in recent years. One incident that stands out is the Russian misinformation campaign which was on the website without being detected for months leading up to the 2016 election.
Some people are arguing that Facebook already unintentionally supports Trump by rewarding content that has viral potential which Trump produces a lot of.
The company made the choice not to take political ads that may contain lies down. Mark Zuckerberg noted that a corporation should not make the call on such things and he cited the first amendment.
On Thursday, Soros said, “Facebook basically has only one guiding principle: maximize your profits irrespective of what harm it may do to the world.”
When Soros made comments about the company in 2018, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer had employees investigate whether Soros was making the comments for financial reasons.
In a statement, Facebook said, “That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook’s stock.”
Sanberg received criticism for mishandling the situation."

Petition E2341 is a petition against a ban on “military-style assault rifles.” The petition was initiated by Alberta resident, Bradley Manysiak.
With over 100,000 signatures, the petition is the second largest in Canadian history.
E-petitions can be open for 30, 60, 90 or 120 days for signature based on what the petitioner prefers. The petitions get a government response within 45 days of their opening. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair is overseeing the “buyback program” which Blair estimates could cost anywhere from $400 to $600 million.
The petition has been sponsored by MP Glen Motz who told The Post Millennial, “I am always pleased to help Canadians voice their concerns, especially on such a deeply flawed policy like the Liberals’ misguided approach on firearms  policy that ignore criminals and instead focuses on law-abiding Canadian firearms owners. It is unfortunate that tens of thousands of Canadians feel ignored, maligned and even demonized by the Liberals, to the extend that this petition even necessary.”
“Canadians expect policies that focus on stopping criminals, gangs and the flow of illegal firearms into Canada, not policies that attacking law-abiding Canadians firearms owners.” Motz added.
“Canadians want clear, honest policies based on facts and evidence. But the Liberals firearms proposals make it clear they are intent on ignoring the evidence and will pursue public safety policies that do nothing to make Canadians safer.”
Blair’s office did not respond to request for comment from The Post Millennial. His office was asked what the minister’s response is to over 100,000 Canadians calling on the government to drop what many experts see as a completely ineffectual action to curb gun violence. Blair was also asked about fellow Liberal MP Marcus Powlowski’s letter addressed to him that opposed the gun ban (Powlowski has since retracted the letter) and Winnipeg Police constable calling the ban “nonsense”.
“When we seize handguns, the handguns are always almost 100% in the possession of people who have no legal right to possess them. They’re almost always stolen or illegally obtained,” said Const. Rob Carver. “I simply don’t see how as a 27-year-old veteran, how adding another layer of law will make any difference, anywhere in this country.”
In Powlowski’s letter to Blair he wrote, “Over the course of the past three months, I have heard a wide variety of views on this proposed ban. I believe it is my role to ensure that these views are brought to your attention for consideration.”
“Given that there is currently no legal definition for a ‘military-style assault rifle’ in Canada, some community members I have spoken with are skeptical that a ban based on this term would make sense as a coherent firearm policy,” the letter continued.
In a CBC interview in the summer of 2018, Blair said that most of the gun crime is committed by illegal handguns smuggled in from the U.S. and he was skeptical of a gun ban being effective in combating gun crime. His position changed drastically once he was appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the public safety minister.
The Post Millennial also reached out to Tracey Wilson, who is a gun rights advocate from the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights.
“Parliamentary e petition E2341 is currently the second most signed petition in Canadian history. If we had the other 27k that missed step 2 we would be in first place. There is still more time so I’m confident we will surpass previous records,” said Wilson.
“This is proof positive that Canadians not only oppose bans on legal guns, but the undemocratic use of OIC’s to do it. I believe the reason for circumventing the usual parliamentary process is the Liberals know they don’t have the support they would need. They are dependant on other parties to pass legislation in their current state of a weakened minority.”
Guys make sure you’re doing the 2nd step or it doesn’t count! We’ve got 27k signatures unconfirmed (more people forgot to confirm than those who signed the anti gunners petition). ????? https://t.co/7L7m2ibZO0— Tracey Wilson (@TWilsonOttawa) January 22, 2020
“There are two main reasons why law enforcement, every credible expert and Canadians in general oppose these measures; 1) they know it’s not licensed RCMP vetted gun owners that need to be targeted, its criminals and gangs. 2) the billions of taxpayer dollars they will waste could have been better allocated to at risk youth and community programs, law enforcement and technology at the border to prevent illicit smuggling.” said Wilson.
She added, “This will go down as one of the Liberal Party’s biggest failures and we are all the victims of it.”
A big portion of the signatures have come from Ontario with 35,533. Alberta had 21,753 signatories and B.C. had 18,930."

The Canadian Radio Television and Telecommunications Commission released a report that the average Canadian spends about $101 a month on the cell phone plans. The agency released a report entitled, Communications Monitoring Report 2019 found that the average cost is $50.25 a month for a basic 5G plan with higher rates in rural areas.
“Larger households may have higher expenditures for these services, e.g. purchasing more internet data,” wrote the Commission: “The data presented here does not allow for analysis of individual expenditures on communications services.”
“Canadians shouldn’t have to choose between having a cellphone and heating their homes,” said Trudeau, one of his main campaign promises last year was to lower cell phone bills by 25 percent.
“As Canadians we pay some of the highest prices in the world for cellphone services while Canadian telecom companies are among the most profitable in the developed world,” the Liberal Party stated in their platform Forward: A Real Plan For The Middle Class. “To help lower monthly cellphone bills and bring costs in line with what people pay in other countries, we will move forward with cutting the cost of these services by 25 percent in the next two years using the government’s regulatory powers.”
During their Throne Speech on December 5, the cabinet repeated their pledge to lower cell phone costs for Canadians. On December 13, they sent a Mandate Letter to the Department of Industry demanding the rates drop by 2021. “If within two years this price is not achieved, you can expand the mobile network operators’ qualifying rules as the CRTC mandate on affordable pricing,” read the letter.
At the communications committee in 2018 Members of the Senate expressed their dissatisfaction with the CRTC’s ability to advocate on behalf of consumers. “Like a lot of Canadians, I’m very frustrated with telecommunications in this country,” said Conservative Senator Michael MacDonald. “It’s outrageously expensive for data. It’s basically a cartel, let’s face it. It’s a small oligarchy.
“I’m not convinced the CRTC has the fortitude to take on these cartels and the consumers are losing because of it,” said MacDonald. “What’s the solution, besides going to the CRTC? Is it relevant anymore in terms of serving the public interest? I’m convinced it is not serving the public interest.”
The Post Millennial reported late last year that many Canadians are now finding loopholes to get comparable American phone plans that cost a third of the price and don’t charge for roaming or long distant calling in North America."

Emerging in Wuhan, central China, last month the disease has already taken the lives of at least 17 people with more than 590 cases of infection. The city is on complete lockdown according to the Daily Mail.
There is little known about the new strain of virus, other than that it causes pneumonia. Scientists believe it might have spread from snakes or bats to humans.
Coronavirus is linked to the same virus that led to the SARS epidemic in 2003 and leading Chinese virologists fear that this new deadly strain of coronavirus could lead to an outbreak 10 times worse than the previous one.
China has locked down its third city in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. The major Lunar New Year events that had been planned for Beijing have been cancelled. Train stations have been shut down in Ezhou. In Huanggang, public schools, trains, cinemas and internet cafes have all been temporarily closed down. All flights have been cancelled in Wuhan and citizens are banned from leaving which has caused panic and people to fight over food supplies.
With almost 600 patients currently infected with the disease, officials predict that at least as many as 10,000 more could be undiagnosed in Wuhan alone. Experts say no virus has spread this quickly since SARS.
Chinese officials are showering the streets with gas in hopes of disinfecting entire streets at a time and roadside quarantine tents are leaving many residents in great fear of what is to come. One resident described the feeling of the city as ‘the end of the world’ in a recent BBC interview.

The coronavirus has left China as well due to travellers who’ve landed in the U.K. and the U.S. One man landed in Washington state from China and was infected with the virus but was not diagnosed until Monday, five days after he returned from China. He is said to have had close contact with at least 16 people within that time period. He is now been quarantined. The main fear is that the virus will mutate and become even deadlier.
An increasing amount of pressure is being placed on the World Health Organization to declare the coronavirus as a public health emergency crisis such as Ebola or Zika were in the past. Wuhan’s Health Commission has reported the city is full of patients with a high fever and that hospital beds are in short supply.

British government ministers have issued a shutdown on flights from Wuhan and are effectively quarantining any passengers entering the country from China. One professor warned that the death rate from coronavirus holds a semblance to the 1918 pandemic of Spanish Flu which took the lives of more than 50 million people.
What data is known thus far about the coronavirus suggests that one in fifty people who contract it will die."

The idea for the move is due to its proximity to the Remembrance Day Parade according to CBC.
The motion Lewis introduced was to restrict any parade permits on public streets between Nov. 1-11, the idea being so that the public doesn’t lose focus on the veterans and the sacrifices they’ve made. Lewis serves as chair on the committee.
“As a member of the Royal Canadian Legion myself, I think it is important that Remembrance Day and the lead up to it have a public focus on our veterans and the sacrifices they have made for us,” Lewis wrote in a letter.
The London Santa Claus Parade has taken place on the second Saturday of November in the past, a date that often falls just before Remembrance Day, leaving many veterans feeling unappreciated.
The organizers of the Santa Claus parade agreed to move the date in the future but Lewis wanted to ensure that this didn’t become an issue down the line.
“As time goes on, people retire from organizing events, other people take over, councils change, mayors change, and I think it’s just a good idea to formalize it in our procedures and policies with respect for our veterans,” he told the committee.
Much to Lewis’ delight, the motion passed 4-1.
Ward 3 Coun. Mo Salih voted against the decision however stating, “Me personally, I’m supportive [of the motion], … but I’m struggling on restricting people from choosing to make their own decisions,”
He went on to add, “Many of those people who have served, served to ensure people can make whichever decisions they want to make and do what they want to do on certain days, but I recognize where this is coming from,”
“It seems like a simple solution,” said Ward 1 Coun. Michael Van Holst, who voted in favour of the motion. “[It’s] surprising that someone hasn’t thought of it before.”
Lewis stressed the importance of dealing with this procedurally, saying it’s the only way to address the issue but the decision will still require approval from city council."

You’d think that wouldn’t make the news with all the more prescient issues at hand but it seems the pettier the better in our clickbait world. Critics wasted no time chastizing the prime minister for his decision to buy doughnuts on taxpayer dollars.
I want to be clear that I don’t like Justin Trudeau. I didn’t vote for him the first time around. I didn’t like that he ran on his father’s legacy. I don’t like his pious cadence. I don’t like his inability to answer basic questions. He is at worst corrupt and at best, a plug.
One thing I do like, however, is consistency. I want people to hold one another to the same standards as they would anybody else. The political polarization that is often discussed in regards to the United States has undeniably seeped into our home and native land as well. People get in their camps, left or right, and they stay there. Wilful blindness, logic twisting and “whataboutisms” plague the public discourse and there is no better platform to sling mud than Twitter.
It has become increasingly clear that in today’s political climate you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t. The Liberals are having a cabinet retreat in Winnipeg and Trudeau stepped out to grab some doughnuts and no doubt a much-needed photoshoot. He and the shop in question, Oh Doughnuts posted about the transaction and lo and behold people on the internet got upset about it.
I don’t wish to advertise for bitter Twitter users in this article but if you happen to be a fan of faux outrage, the hashtag is #doughnutgate. In this thread, you’ll find people whining away, primarily about the cost of the doughnuts which came in at a whopping $47 a dozen. That is what we are squabbling about, the difference of thirty some odd dollars it would have cost if he’d bought the doughnuts at Tim Hortons.
Tim Hortons, the famously Brazilian-owned coffee and doughnut chain was surely open and operating just as close by many complained, so why didn’t he go there and save his compatriots the pocket money? Because he’s an elitist, that’s why. It could also be that Tim Horton’s employees in Winnipeg are currently on strike or the franchisee refusing to raise their wages. It could be because the Prime Minister wanted to photo-op of him shopping locally.
I don’t understand why or how, any Canadian could criticize a politician for shopping locally, I can’t even play devil’s advocate momentarily on that one.
Sure the guy likes to spend our money, there are plenty of vacation receipts to prove that, but it’s important to separate the wheat from the chaff.
One Twitter critic complained about the fact that Trudeau was out shopping himself, claiming he could have got one of his assistants to run the errand. The tweet also opened with “Elitist Trudeau.” It’s hard wrap your head around some of this stuff. How can a politician be elitist for not sending his assistant to run an errand but instead opting for a chance to connect with his fellow citizen? It’s absurd.
Again, I’m no fan of Trudeau or of politicians in general for that matter but my disdain for hypocrisy far outweighs any political leanings. I wonder how positively effective social media could be as a forum for communication if the majority of users weren’t operating through an us vs. them scope. The truth of the matter is that we all have more things in common than we do things uncommon.
The next time a politician, or anybody for that matter that you don’t like is doing something just ask yourself, “how would I feel if it was my politician or my friend in this exact scenario?” I’d be willing to bet it would change your perception of it a great deal.
I think we’d all be a step closer to harmony if we seek truth and fairness over a momentary ‘victory.’"

These accusations were made by Clinton in an October interview with David Plouffe.
The Hawaiian congresswoman said she’s proven her loyalty to America via her service in the military in the Army National Guard. The charge claims that Clinton’s comments tarnish Gabbard’s presidential bid and that she must now focus energy on clearing her name. Gabbard believes the accusation comes as a retaliation for her previous endorsement of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary.
“Rep. Gabbard must defend her good name,” Gabbard’s lawyer said in a statement on Wednesday, according to the Daily Mail.
“In February 2016, Tulsi believed the best Democratic presidential candidate for our country was Senator Bernie Sanders. She also knew that Clinton had a stranglehold over the Democratic party and that crossing Clinton, who considered herself the ‘inevitable nominee’, could mean the end of her own political career. Yet Tulsi put the country before herself, and she publicly endorsed Senator Sanders, becoming the most prominent politician to do so at the time,” the complaint states.
“Clinton–a cutthroat politician by any account–has never forgotten this perceived slight. And in October 2019, she sought retribution by lying, publicly and loudly, about Tulsi Gabbard,” it adds.
Gabbard has reacted to the alleged defamation with a $100 million dollar lawsuit for monetary damages and legal fees. Gabbard claims to have already lost $50 million in damages due to the comments from the former secretary of state.
‘The Defamatory Statements have caused Tulsi to lose potential donors and potential voters who heard the Defamatory Statements. Tulsi has suffered significant actual damages, personally and professionally, that are estimated to exceed $50 million,’ the complaint reads.
An additional $50 million in special damages is to be awarded as well, argues the complaint, bringing the total to at least $100 million.
‘Tulsi is entitled to appropriate special and punitive damages of in view of Clinton’s malicious and unrepentant conduct. The amount of these damages will be proven at trial, but in no event should they be less than the amount of Tulsi’s actual damages,’ it reads.
Forbes magazine estimated that the combined net worth of Hillary and Bill Clinton was $240 million during the 2016 campaign and it is suffice to say it has risen since.
Nick Merill, Clinton’s spokesman called the lawsuit “ridiculous” according to CNN.
Gabbard stated in the lawsuit that Clinton is unable to get over the 2016 election and thus has a particularly “special hatred and animosity” for her.
“Clinton has not gotten over her loss in that election and still dwells on what happened. Clinton blames many persons for her loss,’ reads the complaint, adding: ‘Clinton reserves a special hatred and animosity for Tulsi – who never endorsed Clinton, did not campaign for her, and to top it off, gave the nomination speech for Senator Sanders at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.”
Gabbard also states in the complaint that there is no basis for the accusations Clinton has levelled against her.
“Clinton had no basis for making her false assertions about Tulsi – and indeed, there is no factual basis for Clinton’s conspiracy theory. Clinton’s peddling of this theory has harmed Tulsi, has harmed American voters, and has harmed American democracy. Tulsi brings this lawsuit to ensure that the truth prevails and to ensure this country’s political elites are held accountable for intentionally trying to distort the truth in the midst of a critical Presidential election,” the complaint states.
‘Tulsi has suffered anguish and damage to her reputation, with direct and substantial injury to her positions as United States Congresswoman; Presidential candidate; and officer in the Army National Guard,’ it adds.
Gabbard’s presidential campaign has failed to meet the qualifications for the last two primary debates and has been unable to gain momentum thus far. She is currently ranked second last for the Democratic nomination and according to RealClearPolitics holds a 1.3 percent approval rating.
Gabbard is choosing to focus on her presidential bid and therefore won’t see re-election to her congressional district in Hawaii."

The Bank of Canada has joined the study group alongside the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Swedish Riskbank and the Swiss National Bank.
The Swedish central bank began studying the issue several years ago and has already implemented a pilot project to deal with the country’s declining use of cash however they haven’t reached a final conclusion on whether or not to keep the project. The Bank of Canada stated in a press release that they will assess the potential for digital currencies in their home jurisdictions.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently in circulation are not suited for paying for things because their value can fluctuate too quickly. The Libra project, backed by Facebook, is a digital currency that has been called a stable-coin because it is tied to existing currencies. The major backers in Bitcoin such as Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and eBay have all left the association in order to oversee Libra as it comes under fire from regulatory authorities.
The goal of the group is to assess technical issues and share their knowledge of impending technologies. Benoit Coeure, a former top ECB official and Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England will serve as the group’s co-chairs."

The letter received a lot of attention from those opposing the ban and was circulated around the internet.
The letter was dated January 16 and included objections and concerns regarding the plan. Powlowski said that he wrote the letter to pass on views of his constituents. One supporter wrote that Powlowski is “standing up to his own party.”
This is from Liberal MP. He knows an OIC is going down a slippery slope. He also knows that a ban doesn't do anything to stop the street violence. Give this man kudos to standing up to his own party. https://t.co/vDKKWaA1QWhttps://t.co/xLLLC35YSv— Stacey Cartmell (@fivefivesix_ca) January 20, 2020
“Over the course of the past three months, I have heard a wide variety of views on this proposed ban,” wrote Powlowski. “I believe it is my role to ensure that these views are brought to your attention for consideration.”
iPolitics reported that Powlowski has worked as a doctor with First Nation communities in northern Ontario for around two years. He has also acquired two degrees in law from Harvard University.
“Given that there is currently no legal definition for a ‘military-style assault rifle’ in Canada, some community members I have spoken with are skeptical that a ban based on this term would make sense as a coherent firearm policy,” the letter said.
“Such a term, as they see it, is more political than policy oriented, and seeks to target certain firearms without a rational basis.”
“For some hunters in my riding, a ban on ‘military style’ firearms would seem to arbitrarily target one forearm over another based on their appearance.”
Powlowski brought up the fact that “military style assault rifles” are frequently used for legal hunting reasons.
Many people have also brought up the fact that the ban will be directed at gun owners who obey the law and legally own their weapons as opposed to the criminals who obtain and use firearms illegally.
Glen Motz, the Alberta Conservative MP, has demanded in a House of Commons petition that the issue be debated in court. Part of the reasoning includes Bill Blair’s estimation that the ban will cost over $250 million.
Powlowski wanted to make it clear that he supports the platform but thought that the concerns should be passed on and considered.
He told iPolitics, “I’m completely behind the Liberal party’s policy,” he added, “I’m not a gun enthusiast, I’m just passing on the views of my constituents, it’s part of my job as a Member of Parliament on behalf of my constituents.”
The House of Commons petition against the Liberal gun ban has accumulated 93,683 signatures and counting. The petition has been open since Dec. 17, 2019 and closes on Feb. 15, 2020."

Some people are referring to this trend as a tax revolt according to CTV News.
“If Alberta’s property tax system is not amended to prevent oil and gas companies from refusing to pay property taxes, many rural municipalities will struggle to remain viable,” association president Al Kemmere said in a release.
The municipalities want the province to change the rules in order to force companies accountable for the taxes they owe Kemmere explained. As it currently stands property taxes are controlled by the province and not the local communities.
“A lot of the oil and gas is doing their fair part as citizens, but we need legislation to force others to pay much like everybody else has to pay,” said Kemmere.
Rural Municipalities Alberta conducted a survey of the owed taxes and found that the number has increased 114 percent from a similar survey they conducted in the spring of 2019. According to the survey, oil and gas companies owe a total of $173 million.
Reeve Paul McLauchlin estimates that his municipality of Ponoka County, south of Edmonton, is owed about $2.6 million out of a total of $27 million. The oilpatch consultant said, “It creates operational constraints, our ability to provide community services. We have nonprofits asking for assistance. We say ‘no’ more and more.”
Many people in the industry believe that it’s the way that taxes are assessed that is driving companies out of business. The provincial government is in charge of assessing properties however they evaluate them based on replacement cost and not market value.
“We defend the need for the province to take a look at how assessment works and have it reflective of the market,” said Ben Brunnen, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
“A lot of these unpaid taxes are coming in jurisdictions where you’ve got assets that are older and not as productive or economic. The choice for these types of assets is to shut (them) in or find a way to reduce costs.” he said.
Brunnen suggested that some municipalities are going to have to accept less revenue from oil and gas companies as a result of such shut-in walls which are often abandoned or never reclaimed after bankruptcy.
Last year it was ruled that municipalities are unsecured creditors by the Alberta Court of Appeal. This ruling effectively puts them at the back of the line when it comes to tax collection following a bankruptcy.
The Alberta Liabilities Disclosure Project works to comprehend the impact of old energy infrastructure on the province. Regan Boychuck, a researcher working for the project claimed, “Oilpatch property tax are now voluntary.”
About 40 per cent of unpaid taxes are from distressed companies that are feeling the effects of an industry hit by lower resource prices according to McLauchlin. The rest belongs to companies that continue to operate without paying.
“My personal opinion is that this is a tax revolt,” McLauchlin said. “They are using this as a lever to decrease their assessment and change those costs.”
One could argue that in a sense the process has already begun. Alberta’s United Conservative government brought in legislation that allowed municipalities to cut taxes on specific well by up to about one-third last year.
Initially, the cuts would be reimbursed by the province but the municipalities said that the program has been abandoned and they are left to deal with the loss.
Boychuck said despite the decline of oil and gas reserves the mill rates on wells and other facilities have remained unchanged for years.
“What industry is really saying is that they’ve depleted their wells so far they can’t cover operating costs. The wells are done and whatever wealth remains needs to be directed to clean up rather than looted any further before bankruptcy.”
The Orphan Well Association is an industry-funded group that was created to clean up abandoned wells. They currently have 3,400 abandoned wells under their care and that number is up by 300 since the beginning of last year."

It did not take long for the Duke of Sussex to make his departure to Canada after deciding to step away from the royal family.
According to Sky News, the current house is just a few minutes from where they stayed for Christmas and where the duchess has been for ten days.
Prince Harry has arrived in Canada to join Meghan and son Archie, after agreeing a deal to step back as senior royals.

The Duke of Sussex had earlier attended the UK-Africa investment summit in London, where he met with the prime minister.

Prince Harry also recently met up with Boris Johnson in private at the UK-Africa Investment Summit. It was held on Monday in Docklands.
There were no aids with the two during their informal meeting that took place in a separate room from the other proceedings.
When referring to the couples withdrawal from the country, Prince Harry noted on Sunday that they had “no other option” in the matter.
During a dinner on Sunday Prince Harry noted, “It brings me great sadness that it has come to this. The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly. It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges.”
“And I know I haven’t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.”
“What I want to make clear is we’re not walking away, and we certainly aren’t walking away from you.”
“Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible.”
“I’ve accepted this, knowing that it doesn’t change who I am or how committed I am.”

Prince Harry also mentioned that he hopes “that helps you understand what it had come to, that I would step my family back from all I have ever known, to take a step forward into what I hope can be a more peaceful life.”
“I was born into this life, and it is a great honour to serve my country and the Queen.”
After the Queen had been holding talks with Prince Harry, Prince Charles and Prince William a deal was made. They agreed that the couple would lose funding from the royal family and discontinue any use of their HRH titles.
Prince Harry and Meghan also have to pay back $4.09 million of UK taxpayers’ money that they used to renovate their cottage. They plan to keep the property for the time that they spend in the UK.
When discussing who will be paying the couples security bill, justice secretary Robert Buckland said to Sky News, “I think there is an issue about how public money is spent.”
“Quite clearly there have already been arrangements made about how that family are going to live and how they are going to be able to get private income but there clearly has to be a line of delineation.”
“I think we all want a family like that to be safe, but at the same time I think what really needs to happen is they need to understand how their lifestyle is to adapt and what their needs might be.”"

He proudly proclaimed his support for violent class warfare and said, “what will help is when we send all of the Republicans to the re-education camps.” He praised gulags and said that the “Soviet Union was one of the most progressive places” in history for women’s rights.
The Post Millennial has independently verified that Weissgerber has expressed disdain for police officers, Israel, women, and more on social media—all the while enjoying an opulent lifestyle where he sips champagne, goes sailing and holidaying in Europe.
The former Boston University student has a social media rife with disturbing statements praising Marxism and antifa. He retweeted a post last week critical of Project Veritas’ sting on his colleague Kyle Jurek, an Iowa Sanders field organizer.
In addition to his work on the Sanders campaign, Weissgerber also has a fledgling career as a  Soundcloud rapper, under the name King Manic.
This is the second Sanders staffer exposed by Project Veritas in their “#Expose2020” project. Last week, video showed Kyle Jurek similarly speaking favourably of Soviet gulags and urging similar punishments in the U.S. for counter-revolutionaries. He also expressed support for antifa extremism and advocated for political violence on the street. The Sanders campaign has not responded to the videos."

In a press conference, Fraser told media that the allocated money would be better invested in education.
Yesterday, the Ford government announced that parents who meet requirement thresholds would receive up to $60 a day, with parents who have children in grades 1 to 7 eligible for $25 a day.
Tensions remain high between the Ford government and teachers’ unions, with all unions being in legal positions to strike.
Education Minister Stephen Lecce also announced Wednesday that the measures to ensure all parents were covered would cost up to $48 million a day if all unions were to strike at the same time, and if all eligible parents were to apply."

It’s a claim that has steadily become more mainstream in the months following his sudden death. Baden is citing Epstein’s burst capillaries in his eyes which is a sign of manual strangulation as opposed to hanging.
Baden was a guest on a Dr. Oz special set to air on Thursday, the pathologist examined photographs of Epstein’s eyes and other parts of his corpse taken during his autopsy.
Dr. Baden was present when Epstein’s autopsy took place alongside other physicians. Baden expressed his concern about the unusual change in the cause of death. Once ruled to be undetermined, five days later it was inexplicably changed to suicide by hanging.
Baden described that there were a number of “red flags” which suggest that he was murdered and did not kill himself.
The most damning evidence are of course the burst capillaries in combination with the fact that the colour in his lower legs was pale and not purple or bluish which Baden claims would have been the case had he hung himself.
“In a hanging, the arteries and the blood vessels, the veins are both clogged off and the person is pale. The face is pale,” Dr. Baden said.
“It suffocates you, no blood goes up there,” Dr. Oz concurred.
“That’s right. No blood coming in or out…. with a manual strangulation, there’s a backup of a pressure and the little capillaries can rupture and they’re best seen in the eye.”  said Dr. Baden
Dr. Baden also explained why the pale colour of Epstein’s legs is problematic for a suicide ruling. “The blood settles after we die. The so-called lividity, if you’re hanging, the lividity is on the lower part of the legs.”
“These would be like maroon/purple, front and back and they aren’t.”
Epstein had been awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking after dozens of women came forward and accused him. The majority of women were underage at the time that Epstein was pimping them out to a number of well-known friends and celebrities.
Speculation about to what degree Epstein would cooperate with authorities about naming all the clients he’d arranged appointments for followed immediately after his arrest. Rumours that he would be killed while in prison circulated the internet en masse.
‘’The initial death certificate was issued at the time of the autopsy, it’s pending further study, getting more information.” said Baden. “Five days later it was changed to hanging suicide and one of the things the family wishes to know, the estate wishes to know is, what was that additional information that caused them to change it when five months later and the family still doesn’t know what happened to in the first encounter and what happened to him when he was found dead.”
“Is that unusual, that you have a five-month gap?” Dr. Oz asked him.
“It’s very unusual, especially in a prison situation,” replied Dr. Baden.
Dr. Baden also explained that the “noose” Epstein apparently used to kill himself was inconsistent with his injuries upon examining it.
‘Doesn’t follow the furrow, number one. Number two, there’s no evidence that there’s any blood or tissue on any of the part of the loop. Most of all, this little area shows a pattern that wouldn’t be made by this smooth surface of the sheet that was torn to make the noose.
“The problem I think why we’re here today, five months later, is that there’s been a total lack of transparency in what happened to Epstein,” he said.
Epstein had even been assigned suicide watch to prevent such an event but the prison guards Tova Noel and Michael Thomas failed to complete multiple mandatory checks on him the night that he died. They have since been charged themselves for lying on documents about performing said checks. Prosecutors say they were napping at their desks when not surfing the internet."

Strongest Families is an award-winning charity that provides mental health services to youth and adults throughout the N.W.T. according to a press release.
The Institute helps families to overcome anxiety and behavioural challenges through the use of various evidence-based programs. Operating out of nine provinces in total, coaches provide support any time of the day or night, available in both French and English. Strongest Families also partners with Indigenous advisors to help better connect with people’s needs. The Institute is also committed to respecting the privacy of those they support.
“Our government is committed to making decisions to improve the lives of NWT residents. By partnering with Bell Let’s Talk, Northwestel and the Strongest Families Institute, we are able to provide individuals, families, caregivers and youth with mental wellness and behavioural challenge supports when and where they need them from their home community. There is no waitlist for this innovative, flexible and evidence-based service that is available by phone and can be scheduled around each person’s needs.” said Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services.
One of Strongest Families’ approach is to have weekly 45-minute calls with their clients over a 12 week period, or more if necessary. The clients are given handbooks on different ways that they may be able to deal with their particular mental health issue. There are also videos to accompany the handbook that demonstrate how such skills might be implemented.
“Strongest Families Institute is proud to partner with the Government of the Northwest Territories (NWT), Bell Let’s Talk and Northwestel, to increase access to timely mental health services for children, youth, adults and families. We are honoured to work with these partners to improve access to care. The announcement of this investment allows us to provide our skill-based programs that are proven to overcome mental health issues to NWT residents. Equipping people with life skills will lead to a healthier future. Through today’s announcement of matched funding, together we will improve the well-being of those in need of assistance. Strongest Families Institute applauds Bell Let’s Talk, the Government of the Northwest Territories and Northwestel on their funding commitment to improved mental health wellness for all.” said Dr. Patricia Lingley-Pottie, President and CEO of Strongest Families Institute.
According to Lingley-Pottie about 90 percent of clients report that their mental health issue was eventually resolved or at least improved significantly by the time they had finished the program.
“Bell Let’s Talk is pleased to build on our existing partnership with the Strongest Families Institute to bring new mental health resources to families in the Northwest Territories. Bell and Northwestel share the Government of the Northwest Territories’ commitment to expanding access to mental health support in ways that will make a real difference in people’s lives,” said Mary Deacon, Chair of Bell Let’s Talk.
“As a longstanding partner of Bell Let’s Talk and a passionate supporter of mental health in the North, Northwestel is proud to be involved in today’s announcement about how we will make additional resources available to Northwest Territories families. Mental health affects all of us, and I want to thank Bell Let’s Talk, the Government of the Northwest Territories, and the Strongest Families Institute for the work they are doing to make mental health a priority in our communities,” said Curtis Shaw, President of Northwestel
Bell will donate 5 cents to Canadian mental health programs for each text sent at no extra cost to the consumer. One of the main goals is to remove the stigma of discussing issues of mental health publicly. Bell Let’s Talk will be on January 29th."

Tareq Hadhad was elated to be called up to officially receive his Canadian citizenship. “It’s the biggest day of my life, full of emotions, absolutely,” Hadhad said following the ceremony. He is the first of his family to become a Canadian citizen.
“It’s certainly an honour, I feel that I belong to this amazing nation. I feel that I am free and I will go out of this place so proudly saying that I am so honoured to be a Canadian at this moment.”

Hadhad will waste no time integrating himself into the Canadian culture, saying a top priority is to pick up “a double-double with a toonie and [fly] to watch a hockey game on the weekend.”
Making chocolate is a part of Hadhad’s family history as his father, Assam Hadhad, made chocolate back in Damascus for two decades, employing 30 people in his factory according to CBC. The factory was tragically bombed amid the turmoil and warfare.
Prior to the outbreak of war the company used to ship specialty treats across the Middle East.
Hadhad’s family settled in Antigonish in 2016 after fleeing from Syria. They opened Peace by Chocolate —which ships products throughout the country and employs about 55 people, including other refugees as well.
Marco Mendicino, minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship spoke at Wednesday’s ceremony, “With all the complexities in the world, I think this is just a wonderful silver lining and positive story. It demonstrates that immigration is a true hallmark of our history, but also the key to our future,”
Hadhad passed his Canadian citizenship test with a perfect score, a fact he proudly shared via Twitter. The post went viral, even attracting attention and congratulations from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Can't hide this anymore! I passed my Canadian citizenship test with a 100% Score, not even one answer was wrong. My ceremony will be in a few weeks.

Hadhad’s family has applied for Canadian citizenship and they are hoping to be able to take the test within the next couple of months. Alaa Hadhad, Tareq’s sister said it would mean the world to her and her children to join Tareq’s family as Canadian citizens."

The sudden resignation comes amid a scramble for organization within the party according to a recent article in Maclean’s.
Top Conservative sources have told Maclean’s that Harper’s resignation is allow him to block Jean Charest’s campaign for the party leadership. Although the two once worked closely in the early days of Harper’s reign as Prime Ministers they had a falling out over Charest’s use of funds in Quebec. In 2007, Charest transferred $2.3 billion federal dollars to the Quebec government to pay for tax cuts in the hope to increase his chances for reelection. Harper became suspicious of Charest who ran the Quebec Liberal Party for 15 years.
Charest was formally the premier of Quebec and leader of the Progressive Conservative party from 1993-1998. Charest asked Harper for his blessing to run before Christmas but Harper refused, claiming the party of today was not that of the one Charest had lead in the past. Charest is still likely to run and Harper has decided to get involved in the campaign according to sources.
Harper had already been urged to resign by friends and party officials since the resignation of former party leader Andrew Scheer. This comes at the heels of the dismissal of executive director, Dustin Van Vugt, over Scheer’s expenses. Most conservatives had expected Harper to make a quiet exit eventually but instead he resigned this week without notice while on a trip to India. Harper was attending a forum on international relations and security.
The Conservative Fund Canada handles the finances for the Conservative Party. Since the merger was formed between the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance back in 2003, the fund has been enormously successful.
“The Fund’s in disarray,” said one Conservative senior veteran.
Despite leaving the fund Harper will remain closely involved with the party one source said. Fund members have to stay neutral during leadership campaigns and Harper wants for more “latitude” than the rule permits another source said."
0,2020-01-15T08:13:39.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/trudeau-government-looking-at-compensation-for-canadian-victims-of-online-fraud,Trudeau government looking at compensation for Canadian victims of online fraud,"The Liberal government is discussing introducing a new set of online rights in the wake of many Canadians’ privacy being breached. This would include compensation for victims of online fraud.
When such legislation will be introduced remains unclear, and there is little information on what the compensation would look like, but the government says fines for those found guilty of breaching someone’s personal data are certain.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has assigned mandate letters for Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault in order to curb the problem, asking them to work on a “digital charter” that would usher in new legislation to compensate Canadian victims of data breach, according to the CBC.
“It will be significant and meaningful to make it very clear that privacy is important. Compensation, of course, is one aspect of it,” said Bains, explaining that the government would like “to demonstrate to businesses very clearly that there are going to be significant penalties for non-compliance with the law. That’s really my primary goal.”
Compensation for victims would encourage private companies to take these issues more seriously according to privacy lawyer Ryan Berger, of Lawson Lundell in Vancouver. “It will incentivize organizations … to take steps to protect that information and ensure that, for instance, health information is encrypted,” he said. “So right now, there aren’t the sorts of financial implications for them if they fail to do that.”
It is a pressing issue, about 57 per cent of Canadian online reported experiencing a cyber security breach in 2018 according to Statistics Canada.
Lifelabs, a medical services company reported that approximately 15 million customers in Ontario and B.C. could have had their private information accessed during a data breach last month.
The Quebec financial institution Desjardins Group faced a similar scenario a few months earlier when an employee with “ill intention” gathered 4.2 million client’s information and shared it, resulting in a class action lawsuit for both companies.
Teresa Scassa, Canada Research Chair in Information Law and Policy said, “This is becoming a real challenge for courts and businesses to manage.”
“So one of the questions when I see ‘with appropriate compensation’ — I wonder, are they thinking of something other than class-action lawsuits? Are big companies going to be asked to have reserve funds to pay out compensation? Is there going to be a fixed chart of compensation?”
One avenue to preventing privacy breaches would be the government’s talk of a “right to be forgotten” or “right to erasure” law by calling for the “ability to withdraw, remove and erase basic personal data from a platform.”
In 2014 the European Union passed a law that allowed citizens to ask Google to remove web hits that popped up upon their name being searched if they felt they were problematic. The case was brought about by a Spanish lawyer who fought to have material about his past debt troubles scrubbed from the search engine.
Web hits aren’t usually deleted if they are considered, “inadequate, irrelevant or excessive” under the new law but they rather they are hidden by the tech giants in process call de-indexing or de-listing.
Minister Bains said his department will study the EU version of the law as well as a California’s when drawing up the possible model for a Canadian law.
“I find it a little bit odd that they’ve framed the right of erasure in what I think are pretty narrow terms compared to what the emerging standard seems to be internationally,” she said. “There’s a certain lack of clarity here that I think is, well, maybe deliberate, but in some ways I think maybe it’s a bit of a muddled message too.”
A survey conducted last year by an Angus Reid Institute found that 51 per cent of Canadians were in favour of a right to be forgotten online and the right to have search results changed. Not everybody agreed, with 23 percent claiming that erasing negative information would mean “erasing history and facts.”
“I want to hit the ground running. This is a priority for me and our government. We want to move forward to start to see aspects of the digital charter reflected in legislation and new policies and programs as well,” said Minister Bains. “The goal is to work with opposition members sooner rather than later in presenting this legislation in a timely manner.”
There is currently no timeline as to when the proposed legislation would be brought into place."

They are instead siding with law enforcement who are arguing that banning legal guns is not the way to reduce violent crimes in Canada.
Saskatchewan is among the governments arguing against the planned handgun ban which is only directed at legal gun owners. They are also against banning semi-automatic rifles and allowing municipalities to choose whether they want to ban handguns for their areas on their own judgement.
Ontario’s Premier, Doug Ford, also commented that bans on legal gun carriers will not be an effective way of lowering gun violence in his area or others.
In Alberta’s legislature, they unanimously passed a motion to preserve the rights of their legal gun owners.
Gun bans are opposed by the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. CTV News reported Vancouver police Chief, Adam Palmer saying, “The firearms laws in Canada are actually very good right now. They’re very strict.”
Trudeau previously said, “I very much look forward to the election campaign in which we will be able to share with Canadians our vision for how to keep Canadians safer.”
“That involves, yes, strengthening gun control but it also involves investments that … are so deeply needed in community infrastructure.”
Palmer argued, “People can’t be naive to the realities of how it works with organized crime and smuggling.”
“There will always be an influx of guns from the United States into Canada,” he added. “Heroin is illegal in Canada, too, but we have heroin in Canada.”"

The National Post’s Chris Selley was quick to call out the two establishment broadcasters, tweeting “Regime change” has a specific meaning that Harper doesn’t even remotely allude to in the passages quoted here. He went on to say that the headline was “pathetic.”

Gerald Butts, former Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, agreed with Selley about the fake headlines, chastizing CTV on Twitter by saying, “I’m not in the business of defending @stephenharper, but he didn’t use the phrase ‘regime change’ in this interview. It’s a loaded term to say the least.”

Many noted that the use of the phrase “regime change” in the headlines from these two major news outlets was highly irresponsible, leaving Canadians with the false impression that the former prime minister was calling for a coup or military action.
In fact, Harper never mentioned regime change. Speaking at a global summit in India, what Harper actually said was: “I don’t think any of us believe that Iran would have deliberately shot down an aircraft, but the very fact that Iran, believing such a thing could happen, would be allowing normal civilian traffic, I think, tells you something about the nature of that regime and its priorities.”
Harper followed this by saying “I do believe we need to see a change in Iran if we’re going to see peace in the Middle East.”
CBC has since issued a correction on Twitter and in their original story, stating: “The headline and lead paragraph of this story has been edited from a previous version that stated Stephen Harper said regime change was needed in Iran. In fact, Harper said “I do believe we need to see a change in Iran if we are going to see peace in the Middle East” and also said “I think without a change in the nature of the government of Tehran, the Middle East will continue to be in turmoil,” but he did not use the phrase ‘regime change’ specifically.”

Chappelle joins Donald Glover (Yang’s creative consultant), director James Gunn, titan of tech industry Elon Musk, magician Penn Jillette, actor Ken Jeong, author and philosopher Christina Hoff Sommers, and others on the celeb roster for Yang’s ascendency.

Chappelle will be headlining shows in South Carolina at the end of January in support of the candidate. Yang and Chappelle have been talking since Chappelle reached out to Yang to find out more about his campaign.
Speaking to New England Cable News, Yang spoke about this new collaboration. “Dave’s team reached out to our team, and they were thrilled to put the two of us together,” Yang said. “We sat down and talked about his concerns for the country and what we need to do to for the next generation. Dave’s a dad like I am. And then after we met, he said, ‘Look, I want to help, and what can I do to help?’”
Glover launched a pop-up store in Los Angeles in support of Yang’s campaign, selling $1,00 signed sweatshirts, featuring both his and Yang’s signatures.

Yang has been shut out of tonight’s Iowa debate, and many political insiders have been dubious about his campaign, and unwilling to take him seriously. But his grass-roots following brings large crowds of supporters, and the last quarter filled his campaign coffers with $16.5 million. While Kamala Harris, Corey Booker, Marianne Williamson, and Julian Castro made recent departures from the Democratic race, Yang shows no signs of giving up.
While Yang’s funding is on target for inclusion in the 7th Democratic debate, he did not meet the polling numbers necessary to step onto the stage. His campaign complained that there weren’t enough polls conducted during the time in question, and held a rally the night before the debate. A clear indication of his success is that Yang’s talking points are making their way into the broader Democratic discourse, and celebs like Chappelle are stepping up to spread the word."

The brief chat took place in a private box at the stadium. The pair shook hands

Vaughn was seen chatting and laughing in a private box with the president, as Melania sat between them. The pair shook hands and Trump appeared to point to the star’s lanyard, according to a 31-second clip uploaded to Twitter.
The exchange was filmed by Timothy Burke, a former Deadspin employee who captioned it with, “I’m very sorry to have to share this with you. All of it, every part of it.”
People throughout the Twittersphere were quick to call for the “cancelling” of the comedic actor. This is not the first time a celebrity faced backlash for interacting with a Republican politician. A video of Ellen DeGeneres was scrutinized online as well after a video emerged of her sitting next to former President George W. Bush at a football game.

“Ellen thought she had it rough…Keep Vince Vaughn in your prayers tonight,” user Alex Salvi said.
And who could forget Jimmy Fallon facing massive backlash and a big hit to his ratings after he “humanized” Trump by running his hand through his hair the first time The Apprentice star was running for president.
“Jan 13, 2020: the day Vince Vaughn has been canceled,” one user said, while another wrote, “Ladies & Gentlemen, I regret to inform you Vince Vaughn is CANCELLED.”

“Sad. Vince Vaughn is one of my favorites,” another user wrote. “I always knew he was Republican but this, so gross. I don’t need a Wedding Crashers sequel anymore.”
Some twitter users came to the defence of Vaughn and deference at large.
“It’s an amazing time to be alive when shaking the hand of the president is enough to get you canceled,” user Jason Howerton said.
“So do Swingers and Wedding Crashers get taken off the air for all of eternity now after Vince Vaughn had a civilized conversation with the president at the Superdome tonight?” Joe Concha, a columnist with The Hill, wrote."

But she seems to have changed her mind and is talking about possibly running for U.S. congress.
She tweeted “Picking my tribe” on January 3, referring to her plans to move to Nigeria. The rapper was angry with Trump after the killing of Iranian commander, Qassem Soleimani.

She seemingly changed her mind on Saturday when the rapper wrote multiple tweets about becoming a politician. “I think I want to be a politician.I really love government even tho I don’t agree with Goverment.”
“Like I was watching War documentaries,” she said. “No matter how many weapons a country have you need people ! How are you trying to go against a country and possibly start a war when this country lacks patriotism? I barely see people claiming they LOVE being American.”
“I will have to explain a lot so I will have to do a video or a live talking about it,” said Cardi B. “So imma come back to my last two tweets another day.Imma talk about it another day .”

The 27 year old rapper is currently going through some legal issues that may get in the way of her political aspirations. If she is convicted in a case regarding a 2018 fight in a strip club, she could have to serve up to four years in prison. A report by Rolling Stone last June said:
Cardi B was arrested in October for the fight, which was allegedly caused by the rapper accusing one of the bartenders, Jade, of having an affair with Cardi B’s husband Offset. Jade’s sister Baddie Gi was also harmed in the altercation. According to TMZ, she has now been indicted on two felony counts of attempted assault with intent to cause serious physical injury as well as misdemeanor counts on reckless endangerment, assault, criminal solicitation, conspiracy, and harassment. The Grammy winner was originally only facing misdemeanor charges, but rejecting the plea deal caused additional charges to be made when the case was presented in front of a grand jury.
Cardi B has admitted to breaking the law in the past and doing things such as stealing from men that she has drugged after promising them sex.
Last year, Cardi B was recorded saying, “I had to go strip, I had to go, ‘Oh yeah, you want to f*** me?” she said, “’Yeah, yeah, yeah, let’s go back to this hotel,’ and I drugged n****s up, and I robbed them. That’s what I used to do.”
“Yo, if a n**** cheat on me, I’mma be that guy. I’mma take him out. We gonna get drunk. I’mma get him all perked up and everything. We gonna have a good time, get him super twisted, then bring a b***h around,” she said in another video. “We gonna have a threesome, and when he wake up, he gonna be like, ‘What the f***?!?’ Yeah, because the b**** was a tranny. I’mma be like, ‘Yup, yeah, we had a threesome with a tranny. Yup, yup a tranny sucked your d***.’”"

As a whole, Alberta’s full-time jobs decreased last month as well, according to StatsCan.
The unemployment rate for Edmonton went up from 0.3 percent in December to 8.0 percent. In Calgary, the jobless rate increased 0.2 percent from where it sat at 7.1 percent during the same time period.
Edmonton now has the highest unemployment rate in the country and Calgary sits at number five overall. Alberta’s provincial jobless rate dropped 0.2 percent, down to 7.0 percent in December.
Since December the province has cut 1000 jobs, including 23,600 full-time jobs. To balance that a total of 22,600 new part-time jobs were created in December. Alberta’s labour force lost 7,500 people in December as well.
Alberta’s employment remained more or less the same across 2019, with a 0.2 percent drop for the calendar year.
StatsCan indicated that the numbers were better than expected for the month of December throughout the nation. Last month, Canada acquired more than 35,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent. Alberta remains “cautiously optimistic” that it can renew job-creation and grow in the months to come.
“These numbers reinforce the importance of staying focused on job creation and ensuring that Alberta has a competitive business environment that creates jobs for Alberta families,” a government spokesperson wrote in an email to CTV News.
“Our government will be relentless in our advocacy with the federal government and our partners in Confederation and not rest until we see critical pipeline projects built.”
The Opposition New Democrats were critical of the government’s corporate tax cut citing the new StatsCan numbers as proof. “This is another disastrous month for jobs and, unfortunately, it’s Albertans who are suffering,” NDP economic critic Deron Bilous wrote in a release. “All this is happening as TMX is under construction. This Premier’s plan is failing Albertans. Period.”"

The current governor general is Julie Payette.
Dart and Maru/Blue conducted the poll and found that 60 percent of Canadians involved said they would back The Duke of Sussex taking the position.
John Wright who is a partner at Dart told the National Post, “There’s enthusiasm for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle because in many ways, they’re celebrities.”
Wright also noted that the couple has been involved with Canada in the past. Prince Harry opened the 2017 Toronto Invictus Games and Meghan was living in Canada when acting in a TV series.
He added that the couple has built a separate reputation for themselves and are not just associated with the royal family.
According to Wright, the poll showed 47 percent of Quebecois in favour of the prince taking over as governor general.
He also mentioned that young Canadians involved in the poll from age 18 to 34 were slightly behind Canadians aged 35 to 54 with their support.
When talking about the royal family, Wright said, “Young people are more engaged with (this couple)”
The poll took place on Jan 6 and pulled from 1,515 Canadians.
The Queen is responsible for appointing the governor general and uses the advice of the prime minister to make her final decision.
The palace does not seem to be fully supportive of the couples decision to break from their roles and released a statement on the issue.
The statement said, “We understand their desire to take a different approach but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.”
“Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage.”
British Royalty have been in the governor general position in the past as Vincent Massey was the first Canadian-born individual to fill the position in 1952. All of his predecessors were born in the British Commonwealth or the British Empire."

Brexiteers were happy to finally see Boris Johnson’s bill coming to fruition.
The Withdrawal Agreement Bill was voted on by MPs who voted 330 to 231 in favour of proceeding with Brexit. Jan. 31, 2020 is the current date in which the UK is set to leave the EU.
Before the vote, Stephen Barclay, a Brexit Secretary noted, “This bill was secure our departure from the European Union with a deal that gives certainty to businesses.”
“It protects the rights of our citizens and ensures that we regain control of our money, our borders, our laws and our trade policy.”
“Once this bill has been passed, and the withdrawal agreement ratified, we will proceed swiftly to the completion of a free trade deal with the EU by the end of December 2020,” said Barclay.
“As laid out in our manifesto, bringing the supremacy of EU law to an end and restoring permanently the sovereignty of this place.”
Next week the bill will be further reviewed by the House of Lords. It can go to vote of the MPs again if altered.
In a speech, Scottish National Party MP Ian Blackford said, “We will not accept being taken out of the European Union.”
“I say to the Prime Minister: respect democracy and respect the election result.”
“Respect the right of the people of Scotland to choose our future. We will have our referendum.”
In the third reading, the bill cleared fairly easily in the House of Commons. It passed the other stages in a short period of time as well.
After the latest vote, the plan is to transition over an 11-month period starting on Jan. 31. The UK will still have to add to the EU budget and abide by its rules over the transition period though they will not be considered a member of the union.
Both the EU and UK will be negotiating and making deals during the transition period."

He can also be seen with Chauntae Davies who was Epstein’s personal masseuse and one of his accusers.
Other photos show Clinton smoking a cigar and playing cards on Epstein’s private jet—the Lolita Express.
Chauntae has given some insight into the details of the flight, which travelled to Africa while carrying several other celebrities.
The Boeing 747 travelled to a number of locations in Africa during a humanitarian tour.
Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker were among the celebrities aboard the flight. There is no concrete evidence that Clinton or the others were aware of Epstein’s actions or Chauntae’s abuse.
New pictures continue to show how many ties Epstein had to famous and powerful people during a time when he was involved in criminal activity.
When talking to The Sun, Chauntae said, “It’s clear that Epstein was using this private jet and his wealth to get close to rich and powerful people.”
“Looking back at these images now it raises a lot of questions about why Bill Clinton was using the plane and what perhaps Jeffrey may have been trying to accomplish by having him around.”
Victims have accused Epstein of having underage orgies on the private jet. It is also now well known that Prince Andrew was one of the prominent figures who frequently boarded the jet.
At the time of the 2002 trip, Chauntae was 22-years-old and denied that Clinton behaved inappropriately noting that he was a “complete gentleman” throughout the trip.
Clinton’s statement regarding the flight said: “President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein plead guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has previously been charged in New York.”
“In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the Clinton Foundation.”
The memo also noted, “Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail travelled on every leg or every trip.”"

Carmacks is a remote Aboriginal community and the decision is an effort to “benefit Aboriginal people” with the promise of one job being created. A subsidy of $100,000 was given to bankroll the the facility although some residents are frustrated as it is located two hundred metres from the local kindergarten, according to Ottawa news outlet Blacklock’s Reporter.
The Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency defended their actions in a statement, “The fund is also intended to provide project-based support for activities that help to establish or grow Aboriginal businesses.” The statement went on to read, “It helps applicants pursue economic opportunities that benefit Aboriginal people,”
The name of the pot shop is The Pot Hole and they operate under the business name Carmacks Hotel Ltd. They are the first and so far only known federally subsidized private shop since Parliament passed Bill C-45 An Act Respecting Cannabis back in 2018 that legalized sales of the plant.
The funding was received by Carmacks Hotel Ltd. on April 1, 2018, which was six weeks prior to the Carmack’s application for a retail license from the Yukon Liquor Corporation’s Cannabis Licensing Board. The license was approved on August 16, by the board, with the promise of creating a single job for Carmacks’ community. Carmacks has a population of 554.
“The Board acknowledges the existence of nine active liquor licenses in the area and no cannabis licenses in the area,” wrote the Board, according to Blacklock’s Reporter. “The nearest liquor store is located on the same property as the proposed cannabis retail outlet.”
“The applicant has submitted a thorough and detailed economic assessment including the benefits of the convenience of a local retailer collecting local business revenue while reducing the amount of market share that would go to the black market,” wrote the Board. “The business will create an additional long term employment position with a possible three more employment positions in the future.”"

The ban was brought forth under the guise of health and safety. The school stated, “injury was being caused to younger students as a result of sixth formers carrying ever-larger bags on their shoulders.” Jacob Ford, 17, protested the ban by taking his school supplies to class in a microwave according to the Sun.
Ford called the ban “ridiculous” and had the full support of his mother. Ford brought his supplies to class not only in a microwave but also a wicker basket, another day in a saucepan and finally in a part of a lawnmower. For his actions, he was suspended for two days.
The backpack ban was brought in on the premise that large bags on the backs of older students were hitting the younger students.
Ford initially retaliated to the ban by writing a 3000-word argument to the school, in which he stated, “The reasons for them changing is for one reason and one reason only which has been hammered into all of our brains over the course of the several assemblies that we’ve had. Health and safety. Or more specifically, the year sevens and one member of staff,”
“These people have been struck in the face or knocked backwards by our bags swinging around in the corridor … Once again, I do not doubt this ever happening. But is the best solution really to outright ban backpacks? Surely a compromise can be made,” he wrote, according to Metro UK.
The school administrators, however, called the letter compromised after Ford decided to carry his school items around in odd containers.
“On Thursday, I was called into the headmaster’s office to discuss my document and was told that I had undermined my position by writing a serious report, only to follow it up by taking ridiculous items to school,” he said, according to the paper. “I was told that I had a choice to make, either to have a serious discussion about the issue or to continue my rebellious streak and force the head to take me out of circulation.”
Jacob Ford’s mother felt the issue was a simple expression of free speech and thus supports his humorous attempt to prove his point. “I think Jacob’s protest has been very peaceful and I believe he should have his say,” she said, according to Metro UK. “At the end of the day, I believe in freedom of speech and so I’m very proud of him for standing up for something he believes in. Microwave or no microwave.”
The school was frustrated by her support for her son and the headmaster Stephen Wilkinson said in a statement, “We have a student who has behaved in an increasingly inappropriate way, actions the likes of which I have never witnessed, and who has been sanctioned entirely in line with the school’s policies,” released in Spalding Today. “What disappoints me most is the fact that, rather than working with us, the parent concerned has encouraged and is now seeking to glorify her son’s behaviour.”"

Environment Canada briefly disclosed data that showed emissions went up by millions of tonnes last year from previous years, despite the federal carbon tax being implemented in 2018.
According to the Emissions Projections report released on Dec. 20, even with a carbon tax in effect, the emissions came in at 723 million tonnes in 2018. That number is a jump from the previous year of 716 million tonnes, an increase of seven million tonnes. It is also the highest recording of GHG emissions since 2014.
“Current estimates do not yet fully account for future reductions from green infrastructure, clean technology and innovation,” the report reads, according to Blacklock’s Reporter . The Emissions Projections report also assured that the final numbers would be updated and brought before the United Nations Convention on Climate Change “by January 1, 2020”. However no such finalized information has been forthcoming.
Environment Minister Jonathan Wilksinson responded in a statement, “We know there is much more to do. We continue to work towards being more ambitious.”
“Data for the year 2018 will be submitted to the United Nations by April 15,” Samantha Bayard said, a spokesperson for the department.
The department also refused to confirm to Blacklock’s Reporter its initial estimate that emissions had grown dramatically despite the implementation of the carbon tax. In a testimony at the House of Commons environment committee in 2018, Environment Canada repeatedly avoided providing any numbers on the impact the carbon tax had on emissions.
Last year at the House of Commons environment committee then-Environment Minister Catherine McKenna would not answer questions regarding the impact of the carbon tax on Canada’s overall emissions.
“It’s quite clear under the fifty-dollar carbon tax this government is proposing, this government has no idea what the reduction in emissions will be,” said Conservative MP Roebert Sopuk during a committee meeting last year. “Canadians are being asked to pony up money for a carbon tax and this government has absolutely no idea what the effect will be.”
“We have done modeling,” McKenna responded. “It’s important to understand that putting a price on pollution is part of our broader climate plan. We believe in numbers.”
But no numbers were given.
Last month Blacklock’s Reporter also broke the story that Canadian federal agency the Pension Plan Investment Board invested $141 million in Chinese coal mines."

Here is how the Conservative party can fight back in 2020.
During the 2019 election, 200,000 more Canadians voted for Andrew Scheer than Justin Trudeau, yet the Liberal Party secured 36 more seats.
Scheer’s Conservatives won almost every seat in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Had he won every riding in those provinces, his party would have added less than ten new seats.
With support in traditional western provinces peaking, there is only one way forward.
The party must expand past its current base and attract Liberal or formerly Liberal voters in areas outside of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta.
To do that, it must actively find a way to modernize itself, in areas such as climate change and social policy while retaining the support of traditional Conservatives.
While that may sound problematic, or even impossible, a reality check is in order.
During 2019, a significant portion of Canadians believed a man who bought a pipeline and who couldn’t remember the number of times he put on blackface would be a better steward for both climate change and social policy.
While that certainly says something about the hypocrisy of Liberals, it also says a lot about the current perceived Conservative brand in urban and eastern areas like Toronto and Montreal.
Looking deeper into polling data, the perceived brand becomes even worse.
According to David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data, “the general image on top of peoples’ mind is that this is a party that is aged, is old, and this notion of tradition is strongly tied to the brand of the Conservatives.”
When looking at words associated with the brand, Abacus found “liar,” and “corrupt” in its top 30.
None of that speaks to a winning combination.
Thankfully for the conservative movement, in just a few short months, at the party’s leadership vote on June 27, they’ll have a chance to change their brand and direction.
If they want to win, the membership will have to learn from its defeat in 2019 and choose a leader who can make the big blue tent bigger."

The Tim Hortons employees went on strike after they did not agree to their employer’s offer of a 20-cent raise, effectively striking over the 10-cent difference.
A Winnipeg Tim Hortons locked out its employees Friday morning after its employees demanded a thirty-cent hourly raise.
The Tim Hortons employees picketed at Portage and Main to fight for their wage increase. Ben Garus, a baker who started working at the franchise in August told the Winnipeg Free Press, “We really aren’t asking for much.”
The wage increase is almost equivalent to the price of a timbit.
The location had 15 workers, who are represented by the Workers United Canada Council and during the most recent round of collective bargaining they asked for a 30-cent per hour increase. JP Shearer, the franchise owner, made a counter offer of 20 cents, bringing the wage to $11.95/hr.
Union representative, Andy Spence said to the Winnipeg Free Press the union rejected the offer and had hoped to further negotiations however Shearer responded by giving the employees two weeks notice before locking the employees out and bringing in new workers.
The franchisee operates six Tim Hortons locations in Winnipeg, but only the shops at Lombard Avenue and Graham Avenue are unionized said Spence.
There was a 20-cent an hour raise offered to the unionized employees on Graham and they agreed but when the Lombard shop held a strike vote in December, there was an overwhelming agreement to take action with 95 percent in favour of a strike.
The union was initially certified in 2017 and their first agreement involved a  30-cent raise which brought their hourly wage up from $11.15. Employees are now hoping Shearer will match that for them and help move them towards a living wage.
Living Wage Canada released a report for Manitoba back in 2017 and calculated that for a family of four, with both parents working full-time, the hourly wage had to be $14.54 to cover all costs.
Cherry Garcia, 36, an employee of the Lombard location for seven years, said the extra 10 cents/hr would do a lot to help support her daughter. “It will add up,” she said.
In the meantime, the location’s new employees tended to the morning coffee-break rush, while the manager refused comment."

While MY Society and others mourn the deaths of Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, many other political experts believe the U.S. killing of the two was justified because of the terrorist killing they had orchestrated as military leaders. Human-rights lawyer Kaveh Shahrooz explained to the CBC why the U.S. ordered the air strike on the two, and why he doubts Iran will escalate the conflict with America all that much because in his estimation the regime will want to protect its wealth and stability, which a full-blown conflict with the U.S. would put in jeopardy.
MY Society, which describes itself as a Mosque, community organization and nonprofit, did not immediately respond to The Post Millennial‘s request for comment.

0,2020-01-02T09:48:12.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/ford-government-wants-more-people-going-into-trades-in-ontario,Ford government wants more people going into trades in Ontario,"There is currently a critical shortage of skilled tradespeople in Ontario and that is a top priority for Labour Minister Monte McNaughton for the province in 2020, according to Chatham Daily News.
During an interview Tuesday regarding a year-end MPP for Lambton-Kent said, “My mission is to get more young people into the skilled trades.”
One of the things that would help get more people into the skilled trades is to end the stigma around working in them as well as encouraging business to bring on apprentices and that is the effort McNaughton hopes to put forward.
“We know that one out of every five jobs in the next five years is going to be in the skilled trades,” McNaughton said. “We also know that one in three journey-persons today are over the age of 55, so we’re reaching a crisis point in the shortage of skilled trades in Ontario.”
One of the ways to McNaughton the stigma can be reduced is to reform the education system to expose the trades as an option as early as kindergarten.
“We want to introduce the skilled trades at a younger age than is currently happening today,” said the minister. McNaughton often uses the example of an elevator mechanic whose starting wage is $108, 000 annually. “There’s a huge shortage of elevator mechanics in Ontario.”
The government hired a polling company to conduct focus groups and to survey millennials ages 18 to 34, polling them about the trades industry. Their results showed a great lack of awareness about these options.
“Time and time again, the young people would say, ‘I know how to become a doctor … but I have no idea what constitutes a skilled trade and I have no idea how to become one,’” McNaughton said. The survey results “really highlighted, to me, the broken system that we have,”
One of the initiatives the minister is pushing for is a “multi-million-dollar” investment into a marketing campaign for the trades. The number one problem the government hears from Ontario businesses is the shortage of skilled trades workers.
“Every single day in Ontario, 200,000 jobs go unfilled,” he said. “Just think, if we could fill those jobs … the GDP of the province would be greater, government would have more money to invest in health care and education, and more people would have jobs.”
“I think we have to look at every opportunity to find workers for businesses in Ontario, and businesses have to respond by bringing on apprentices,” he said.
The Ontario Electrical League released a report in November that showed 75 percent of contractor members that they surveyed have hired at least one apprentice.
The credit for this comes for the government’s Bill 47, Making Ontario Open for Business Act according to the Ontario Electrical League. The bill established a one-to-one journey-person to apprentice ratio which was a change from the previous ratio which was more restrictive in the past.
President of the Ontario Electrical League Stephen Sell responded to the announcement by saying, “Now more than ever, one of the most emphasized topics of conversation among the trades is preparing today’s generation for the future,”
“One-to-one ratios not only allow people to land coveted apprenticeships, but it may just influence those that could be considering a career in the skilled trades–who are now much more inclined to pursue one knowing that a major roadblock has been lifted.”
Bringing in skilled immigrants and working to get more Indigenous residents and women into the trades is also part of McNaughton’s initiative in rounding out the gap in tradespeople."

In the electoral campaign the Trudeau government said that they would be introducing the system. The person Prime Minister Trudeau designated for the job is Marco Mendico, a new immigration minister.
The goal of the program is to put some of the decision making abilities in the hands of local communities based on their needs. Trudeau’s mandate letter noted that there will be more than 5,000 spaces created by implementing the new program.
According to CBC, Mendico said that the program helps “to draw on local experiences, expertise, capacities to understand where are the labour shortages, where are the economic opportunities and how that information can help us select individuals who wish to come to Canada to ply their trade, to fulfil their opportunity.”
The current ratio of workers to retirees in Canada is 4:1 according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).  By 2035 that ratio is expected to drop to 2:1.
In the past ten years about three quarters of the population growth in Canada has been due to immigration. The IRCC projects that by 2031, this number will rise to 80 percent.
Similar programs have been put forward to bring newcomers into rural areas and Atlantic Canada to fill job positions.
Leah Nord, who works for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce as director of workforce strategies and inclusive growth, noted that there are labour gaps throughout the country. She added that close to 500,000 job positions are not being filled.
Many immigrants end up in Canada’s major cities and this program is meant to bring and keep skilled workers in smaller communities.
Nord told CBC, “One of the greatest ways to ensure immigration integration is a success is to have a job, to have labour market integration,” she added. “And that comes from the employer, from the chambers, from the business point of view. Having them involved in the beginning and making them those liaisons is key to success.”
She explained that a lot of immigrants will be able to “hit the ground running” by having job opportunities when they arrive.
Chief economist of The Conference Board of Canada, Pedro Antunes, mentioned that with ageing populations, immigrants will play a critical role in the labour market in Canada.
Antunes said, “The economic migrants play a big, big role … in helping us grow our workforce at a time when, if not for immigration, we’d actually be seeing a decline in the number of workers in Canada.”
According to the Conference Board, by 2030, the number of baby boomers reaching retirement age will be over nine million.
Mendicino’s mandate letter also says “This continues our modest and responsible increases to immigration, with a focus on welcoming highly skilled people who can help build a stronger Canada.”
Mendico is planning to review outcomes based on data and will be working directly with Canada’s provinces and territories."

The Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) government’s legislation raising the minimum age for smoking marijuana from 18 to 21 will go into full effect starting Wednesday.
The age raise means that Quebecers under the age of 21 will no longer be allowed to possess or purchase recreational cannabis.
The legal drinking age in Quebec remains 18, the province has no plans on raising it.
This move is very interesting, as a significant portion of marijuana consumers in the under 21 age category chose to use the drug under criminalization less than 14 months ago.
Furthermore, the black market which accounted for 82% of all marijuana products bought in Quebec during the first year of legalization has ample enough supply to provide to anyone under the age of 21.
That black market is notably no longer hidden behind a web of connections.
It is out in the open and can be regularly accessed through uber-like services on the web.
That means that while illegal, it is likely that most individuals under 21 will not reduce their consumption, but rather just switch their provider from a legal one to an illegal one."

The Scandinavian country is also on course to drill more oil wells in the future than they ever have in the past.
It is estimated that the country will drill 130 wells this year—16% more than in 2018. According to Rystad Energy, 55 of the wells are meant for drilling for new sources of oil. This is sometimes referred to as “exploration drilling.”
According to Fortune, drilling is expected to take place in the Norwegian Continental Shelf, where much of the oil production occurs in the North Sea.
Rystad analyst Eivind Drabløs, said, “This brings activity levels in line with the record pace last seen in 2013 and 2015 before the effects of the oil price collapse took hold on the drilling market in Norway.”
The agency has also predicted that between now and 2023, there will be around 30 to 50 drills per year for “exploration” purposes.
Consultancy Wood Mackenzie noted in January that there is a “promising year ahead” for North Sea oil exploration with help from raised budgets for the oil companies.
Around the same time, analyst Neivan Boroujerdi wrote, “Norway will be at the heart of the uptick, with drilling expected to reach pre-downturn levels.”
Norway is at the forefront of the green movement, which puts them in an interesting situation. The country has embraced many green technologies though much of their wealth has come from the drilling of oil.
In 1969, Norway began drilling offshore, making the country one of the biggest producers of oil in the world. This brought in a large amount of wealth to the Norwegian people. The oil coming from the North Sea also contributed profit to the U.K.
Many Norwegians are not happy with the oil industry and have been making themselves heard. Some parties such as the Greens and the Socialist Left party have been gaining support as they are against heavy drilling in the industry, while parties supporting the growth have taken a hit.
The political division has been growing in the country as the drilling continues alongside green initiatives and an ever-increasing awareness of the impact drilling is having on the climate."

Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault’s mandate letter from Justin Trudeau charged him with the creation of new regulations for social media platforms.
Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault’s mandate letter includes regulations targeting the removal of illegal online content “harms such as radicalization, incitement to violence, exploitation of children, or creation or distribution of terrorist propaganda.”

Firms such as Facebook or Twitter would be required to remove such content within 24 hours or face punishment.
If that seems a bit vague, it is because the definition of “illegal content” is not yet set, but according to iPolitics, Minister Guilbeault has said he will be meeting with Justice Minister David Lametti to clearly define it.
Interestingly, the government could go further on its list of “illegal content,” in the same article by iPolitics, Minister Guilbeault said he would have conversations with stakeholders on whether to also include regulations on fake news."

According to iPolitics, Heritage minister Steven Guilbeault “plans to work with the CBC, per his mandate letter, to see if they can produce more regional content through hiring more people, opening more offices, or partner with existing media.”
Guilbeault also stated that while he has yet to speak with the CBC regarding expanded mandates, he would ensure increased funding would be a part of any new mandate.
Interestingly, Guilbeault maintained that new funding would not compete with local media initiatives, sidelining the CBC’s continued expansion into areas typically considered the domains of private media corporations, such as digital advertising.
While the move to increase CBC funding is sure to energize the Liberal base, it is likely to face a response from those who oppose state broadcaster growth. This response includes not just citizens who fear a large state-funded political organization, but also private media worrying about a growing tax-funded competitor.
The CBC has notably been described as an “Uber predator” by some publishers such as James Baxter, while outlets such as Canadaland have published articles calling out the broadcaster for stealing competitors scoops without citation.
Even in the Globe and Mail, the CBC is described in its current form as “an anachronism that leverages its massive public subsidy to engage in predatory behaviour in no one’s interest but its own.”"

Russia announced on Friday that it had become the first nation to enter an intercontinental hypersonic weapon into military service.
“Today, we have a unique situation in our new and recent history. They [other countries] are trying to catch up with us. Not a single country possesses hypersonic weapons, let alone continental-range hypersonic weapons,” said Putin.
Development of the Avangard reportedly began after Putin claimed the U.S. efforts to develop new missile defence systems would handicap Russia’s nuclear deterrent capabilities.
Russia has shown the Avangard to U.S. inspectors in November.
What are hypersonic weapons?
Travelling at a minimum of five times the speed of sound (Mach 5), hypersonic weapons combine the speed of a “ballistic missile with the maneuvering capabilities of a cruise missile.”
The unique combination of speed and maneuverability creates a weapon which at the moment allows them to evade missile defence systems.
The Russian hypersonic weapon can reportedly fly 27 times faster than the speed of sound and will be mounted on Soviet-built RS-18B intercontinental ballistic missiles, code-named SS-19 by NATO.
Of course, no weapon is ever permanently unstoppable, it just so happens this one will take some serious investments to counteract.
For example, US officials have talked about putting a layer of sensors in space in order to detect the hypersonic weapons.
While American officials prepare defence initiatives, they themselves worryingly remain quite far behind when it comes to putting forward their own hypersonic nuclear deterrent.
According to a statement made by Defense Secretary Mark Esper in August, “it’s probably a matter of a couple of years” before the U.S. also has an operational equivalent.
Perhaps, even more worrying, the United States could also be behind China, its chief military counterweight, when it comes to fielding its own hypersonic weapon.
China has reportedly begun testing two hypersonic missile systems.
The United States has multiple projects in development, although the earliest results are expected no sooner than 2023."

That party is called the Liberal Party.
They already govern the country, and the results are increasingly disastrous, as Canada’s economy weakens, our national unity crumbles, and political division reaches unprecedented levels.
And yet, much of the establishment media pundits seem to think that Canada needs another Liberal Party.
Case in point, the effort to push Jean Charest as Conservative leader, and the advice calling on the Conservatives to stop defending law-abiding gun owners and stop opposing the carbon tax.
Democracy really only matters if there are actual choices. After all, tons of countries have “elections” without being democratic. In those countries, you get to pick from a pre-approved list of candidates who all agree on everything, and are all beholden to the same power structure.
Sure, you get to vote, but there is ZERO chance of your vote changing anything.
And, if the establishment elites get their way, that’s what Canada will become.
If Canada’s “Conservative” Party ends up as a party that supports the carbon tax, demonizes law-abiding gun owners, hurts our own energy sector, concentrates power in the elitist bureaucracy, refuses to even discuss immigration, and gives more of our money to foreign countries, then what is the point of having a “Conservative Party?”
There would simply be two Liberal parties, and Canadians would be denied any real choice.
The fact is that the elites don’t believe Canadian Conservatives deserve a voice.
The Conservative base, most heavily concentrated in the West and Rural Ontario, represents a huge slice of the country, far bigger than the base of the NDP, Greens, and Bloc.
Yet, the elites believe the Conservative base must be silenced, and they have contempt and even hatred for the base.
Their effort to turn the Conservative Party into another Liberal Party is an expression of that contempt, and it risks wiping out what’s left of Canada’s democracy.
Our elections must offer us a real choice, and that means having real options. And that’s why the Conservative Party must remain a unique organization that offers something other parties don’t.

However, NBC reported that “Facebook took down more than 600 accounts tied to the pro-Trump conspiracy website The Epoch Times for using identities created by artificial intelligence to push stories about a variety of topics including impeachment and elections.” This is misleading phrasing that correlates content to removal.
As part of its investigation, Facebook claims that it found links between BL and Epoch Media Group (EMG), which is the parent group of The Epoch Times. It is this affiliation that mainstream media outlets like NBC and NPR used to make the argument that there was a connection between The Epoch Times content and the removal of the BL network of accounts from Facebook.
The BL, or Beautiful Life network, operates primarily within the US, though it is based in Vietnam. During the course of its investigation, Facebook says it found ties between BL and the EMG, which operates The Epoch Times, among many other news media properties. BL shared The Epoch Times content, as so many other pages. Due to the perceived ties between BL and EMG, Facebook is now investigating the EMG.
EMG has stated that it is not linked to BL. Per a blog post from EMG, “The BL (BL) and its activities have been portrayed as being part of Epoch Media Group (EMG) and by extension The Epoch Times. This is categorically false. EMG has never been affiliated with BL and does not engage in or support the behavior BL is alleged to be involved in… The situation is complicated by the fact that BL is connected with the independent company ??i K? Nguyên (Vietnamese Epoch Times, or VET), with which EMG was forced to cut ties in October 2018.”
Facebook and EMG are in disagreement over the connective tissue between the two networks. The founder of BL had once been employed by the EMG, and employees from Epoch Media came to work for BL. Prior to their leaving the employ of EMG, some of those individuals had been listed as Page admins for EMG Facebook Pages. There was a long lag in those former employees names being removed as admins on the EMG pages.
When asked about the perceived links between The BL and The Epoch Times, a Facebook company spokesperson told The Post Millennial “with all due respect to the publisher of The Epoch Times, he may not know executives at The BL were active admins on Epoch Media Group Pages as recently as this morning [December 20] when their accounts were deactivated and The BL was removed.”
Facebook’s reason for removing BL were that “The people behind this activity made widespread use of fake accounts—many of which had been automatically removed by our systems—to manage Pages and Groups, automate posting at very high frequencies and direct traffic to off-platform sites. Some of these accounts used profile photos generated by artificial intelligence and masqueraded as Americans to join Groups and post the BL content. To evade our enforcement, they used a combination of fake and authentic accounts of local individuals in the US to manage Pages and Groups.”
They go on to say that “Although the people behind this network attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation linked this activity to Epoch Media Group, a US-based media organization, and individuals in Vietnam working on its behalf. The BL-focused network repeatedly violated a number of our policies, including our policies against coordinated inauthentic behavior, spam and misrepresentation, to name just a few. The BL is now banned from Facebook. We are continuing to investigate all linked networks, and will take action as appropriate if we determine they are engaged in deceptive behavior.”
EMG believes that “The language used by Facebook is irresponsibly unclear. By saying that EMG is ‘linked’ to BL’s activity, Facebook suggests that EMG is responsible for BL’s activities or has coordinated with BL, without Facebook’s statement providing any evidence that this is so. Media outlets have then jumped on the hint Facebook has given, and reported EMG is guilty of activities it has had no part in.”
Facebook security is all about procedure, technical violations and terms of service breaches. They do not credit content, other than those that violate hate speech restrictions, etc., as a reason for removal. Yet NPR’s Lulu Garcia-Navaro interviewed Snopes VP of Operations, Vinny Green, about their independent investigation into the link between BL and The Epoch Times.
Garcia-Navaro asks: “This investigation centers around a group called the BL, or Beauty of Life. And you found that it has extensive links to The Epoch Times. So remind us where The Epoch Times sort of lives in the media ecosystem.”
“Yeah. Well, it’s really far-reaching,” Green replied. “Not only do they have a print edition that distributes pretty widely, but they have a very dominant online presence. They’ve really—have established a vast multimedia, multiplatform distribution channel and artificially, through advertising, boost their prominence. And it—so it’s widely read and widely distributed. But it is this very fringe publication. And we’ve discovered that it’s got some other tentacles that are reaching out into the media landscape and—one of which was this vast network called the BL.”
“Yeah. I mean, their main page has more than 6 million followers on Facebook,” Garcia-Navaro chimed in, “and they have ties to the Falun Gong movement, which is a spiritual practice which the Chinese government calls a cult. And these fake pages and profiles had a lot of pro-Trump content but also anti-Chinese government, too. What were they pushing out?”
Snopes is primarily concerned with invalidating The Epoch Times, who it disparages for running content that supports President Trump. “What we saw was an extreme amount of pro-Trump content,” Green said. “Almost exclusively what we were looking at on the BL was the amplification of pro-Trump media… And that content plays well on Facebook.”
Garcia-Navaro noted that “Some people have called this sort of industrial-scale misinformation.”
However, the founding mission of The Epoch Times, founded in 2000, was “in response to communist repression and censorship in China.” The originators were “Chinese-Americans who themselves had fled communism, sought to create an independent media to bring the world uncensored and truthful information.” Part of their early work was in writing about the persecution faced by members of the Falun Gong religious sect, which Snopes additionally stigmatizes in repeating the Wall Street Journal reporting that “Beijing declared Falun Gong an evil cult and launched a brutal crackdown on its practitioners in China,” which Garcia-Navaro then echoed.
Snopes attempts to discredit The Epoch Times by trivializing its founding mission, and by using the Chinese government’s defining of a religious group as a cult, which has been persecuted by that same government, as evidence of wrongdoing by The Epoch Times.
To recap, The Epoch Times was founded to bring light to human rights abuses in China, many of which are undeniable. Because the outlet has reported favourably about the sitting American president, who is well derided in mainstream media, the Facebook investigation into their parent company’s link to a media outlet with improper account practices is now being used to discredit the validity of their content.
The Epoch Times is not free from run-ins with Facebook security. In July, The Epoch Times pages were barred from placing any further ads on the site. The ads The Epoch Times were running were primarily to drive subscribers to their print edition, and they spent a large sum of money doing this. After they were ad-banned, The Epoch Times tried to get clarification from Facebook as to why this had happened. Unable to get a clear answer, The Epoch Times set up additional accounts, and used them to run the subscription ads. The ads were approved. However, because this was a work-around of the ad ban, those accounts were then removed. The Epoch Times is no longer permitted to run ads on Facebook.
The Epoch Times has tried to reach out to Facebook and get an audience as to how to reverse the ad ban. Facebook’s assertion is that “a total ban is so rare, the review so conclusive, and the violations so egregious,” that there is no formal appeals process. Despite Facebook’s assertion that the ban of BL was procedural and not based on content, mainstream media outlets have framed the story that the content was partially to blame. While EMG claims no connection to BL and has provided documentation to clarify, Facebook claims it is still investigating.
The Post Millennial reached out to The Epoch Times publisher, Stephen Gregory, regarding the assertion by mainstream media outlets that “misleading” content is part of the reason EMG us being investigated. Gregory stated that “The Epoch Times is an independent media organization. Which means that our reporting is oftentimes different from other media. We can’t speak to the motives of other media organizations, but we are disappointed by the continued inaccurate reporting about us. EMG’s Facebook pages were not affected by Facebook’s actions against the BL. As stated in our public statements, EMG is not affiliated with the BL. We are also disappointed in Facebook issuing a statement suggesting Epoch Media Group responsibility for BL’s actions without first contacting us to find out if their assumptions about us were accurate. The result was that Facebook has damaged our good name.”"

Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organization.”
That was a message found inside of a Tesco Christmas card. It was discovered by a six-year-old girl in London, England according to the Sunday Times.
The card was purchased from a local Tesco by Florence Widdicombe’s mom so that Florence could give them out to her classmates.
“We didn’t open (the cards) on the day that we got them, we opened them about a week ago,” Florence said.
“We were writing in them. About on my sixth or eighth card, somebody had already written in it.”
Florence’s mother decided to reach out to human rights organizations as well as former reporter Peter Humphrey.
Humphrey has spent years imprisoned in Qinpu at the same facility for breaking Chinese privacy laws. The BBC reported that the packing of Christmas cards has been forced upon inmates for two years and Humphrey concurred.
Tesco said they were shocked to learn the nature of which their cards were being produced and has immediately halted operations with Zhejiang Yunguang Printing, the China based company.
Humphrey told the BBC that “The foreigners cellblock in Qingpu prison had about 150 foreign prisoners when I was there,” he continued, “Today, it has about 250. These prisoners are living a very bleak daily life.”
In describing the conditions he lived under during his time imprisoned at the facility Humprhey said that prisoners were placed 12 at a time in grey cells.  Each with an iron bed with a mattress that was no more than an inch thick. There was no heating through the winter and conditions got extremely cold.
Inmates are expected to follow “highly regimented” work programs and over the past year, the manual labour has become mandatory, working for pennies on the dollar. What money they can earn overtime is used to buy basic hygiene necessities such as soap.
An audit conducted in November of Zhejiang Yunguang Printing  concluded that there were no signs of forced labour involved in their manufacturing process, Tesco said.
“We have a comprehensive auditing system in place and this supplier was independently audited as recently as last month and no evidence was found to suggest they had broken our rule banning the use of prison labour,” said a Tesco spokesperson. “If evidence is found we will permanently delist the supplier.”"

New rules of evidence in sexual assault trials came into effect a year ago which were intended to strengthen the protections and privacy rights of complainants. Despite the dire warnings of criminal defence lawyers, Bill C-51 was implemented and the constitutional challenges began.
The primary issue with the new rules of evidence is what’s referred to as reverse disclosure, and the new requirement that all records (like text messages or emails) in the possession of the accused must be revealed to a complainant prior to trial. The purpose was to avoid ambush during cross-examination and to give the complainant the ability, with legal counsel, to either block the evidence from the trial or limit the way in which the records could be used.
Of course, the effect of these hearings, if held in advance, would warn the complainant of the defence material and strategy prior to testimony. It would allow the accuser the time and ability to tailor the testimony to avoid impeachment.
In a National Post article, Brian Platt provides a thorough summary of the fallout across the Canadian courts as judges come to different conclusions on whether or not the new rules violate the accused’s right to a fair trial. Platt discusses some of the recent decisions pointing out that “some judges have upheld the legislation, others have declared it unconstitutional, still others have found serious problems but suggested on-the-fly solutions to save it.”
In an article on his website, criminal defence lawyer Joseph Neuberger notes “the split decisions on how to apply the new legislation has created an uncertainty and the reality that two different people charged with the same crime will find themselves facing different rules at trial. The blame for this chaos falls squarely at the feet of our lawmakers who have rushed to please partisan interest groups at the expense of due process.”
In intervener submissions to the Supreme Court in March, 2019, defence lawyer Marie Henein stated “while [an advance hearing] allows the trial judge to put defence counsel on a leash, there is a difference between a leash and a choke chain. There is a difference between corralling someone and hogtying them.”
And the new rules go well beyond sensitive issues involving evidence of a sexual nature. Bill C-51 added section 278.92 which declares all records in the possession of an accused to be presumed inadmissible unless approved in advance hearings. That captures all communications between a complainant and accused even in the absence of sexual content.
The definition of “record” was originally crafted to address requests for third party documents that would have an expectation of privacy, such as medical or counselling records. Some defence lawyers have successfully argued that evidence in their possession does not qualify as a “record” because the complainant’s privacy concerns are not engaged.
In a recent Ontario decision, R v W.M., Justice Davies found that once a complainant makes a serious criminal accusation the expectation of privacy changes. “Regardless of how their relationship is characterized at the time the messages were sent, it is important to consider the nature of their relationship now.”
Justice Davies went on to consider the other consequences of determining that all communications trigger privacy rights by noting those rights would then extend to the accused. Davies notes that complainants often provide electronic communications to the police in support of an accusation and “if the accused retains or might retain a reasonable expectation of privacy over messages he sent to the complainant, the police may well be required to get a warrant to take copies of them from the complainant.”
This reciprocal application of the law, that would protect both complainants and the accused equally, connects to recent Supreme Court decisions which could start complicating sexual assault trials for Crown prosecutors.
The Supreme Court of Canada has declared that rules of evidence in sexual assault trials apply equally to both the defence and prosecutors regardless of who introduces the evidence. Both sides must comply with the legislation. These evidentiary rules are set out in sections 276 and 278 of the Criminal Code.
Writing for the majority, in R v Goldfinch, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis stated that “Crown-led evidence of prior sexual activity must be governed by the principles set out in s. 276(1) and Seaboyer.” The Seaboyer decision in 1991 had thrown out the previous “rape-shield” provisions as unconstitutional and laid guidelines for determining whether or not evidence had sufficient probative value that outweighed the risk of prejudice.
What this means is that prosecutors must also now obtain prior judicial guidance on what evidence they can use in their case against the accused. They can no longer freely lead evidence from a complainant that references other sexual activity just because it favours the complainant. To put it simply, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.
This is an important issue with the way sexual assault trials are currently conducted. Too often a complainant will give testimony about prior sexual acts or relationships and the defence is not permitted to properly cross-examine on that evidence.
The primary, forbidden lines of reasoning in legal arguments are referred to as the “twin myths”: that a complainant is more likely to have consented or less worthy of belief because of prior sexual activity. When looked at from reverse, it would be equally wrong to argue that prior lack of sexual activity would make the complainant less likely to consent or more worthy of belief.
In the past, complainants have been allowed to testify that they were a virgin prior to an alleged incident while the accused is not permitted to adduce evidence regarding absence of virginity. This had been justified in appellate courts by the claim that prosecutors were using the evidence of virginity as a “physical state” not as reputation evidence. Of course a jury would likely take this evidence to mean the complainant was less likely to consent but the Supreme Court has not made any rulings on this issue.
Indeed, in a July 31, 2019 Supreme Court decision, R v R.V., the majority decision declined to consider “whether sexual inactivity is captured” by the legislation. Despite not determining the issue, Justice Karakatsanis, who delivered both majority decisions in Goldfinch and R.V., agreed with Justice Paciocco that “it would be incongruous to hold that the statement ‘I am a virgin’ does not engage s. 276 while an answer to the contrary would clearly be a reference to sexual activity.”
Having decided the case on other issues, Justice Karakatsanis stated they will “leave this issue for another day.”
That day may have arrived.
In a December 19, 2019 verdict from the BC Court of Appeal, the majority overturned a conviction in the case of R v Langan on the grounds that Crown led evidence that should have been subjected to the new rules enacted by Bill C-51.
Justice Stromberg?Stein wrote for the majority that “whether sexual history evidence is sought to be admitted by an accused person or by the Crown, the same principles apply.” The prosecutor had entered text messages into evidence in which the complainant told her ex-partner in advance that she would not be having sex with him that weekend.
This evidence appears to have been used to bolster the credibility of the complainant, implying that a prior sexual refusal made her less likely to consent after he arrived for the visit.
It is well established that complainants cannot give advance consent, retaining the right to withdraw consent at any time. Additionally, complainants are not required to fight back or verbally resist sexual activity to prove a lack of consent. The onus is on the accused to acquire positive communications of consent whether through words or actions.
As with the problem of the virginity question, if advance verbal rejection of sexual activity is taken to mean the complainant was less likely to have consented then the reverse logic would imply advance verbal consent makes the person more likely to have consented or less worthy of belief.
The public is regularly inundated with stories and claims in the media that the justice system is failing complainants. Every acquittal is deemed a failure and every conviction is celebrated as a triumph. In response to public outrage, the new rules governing sexual assault evidence were implemented by Bill C-51 to improve conviction rates and make it easier for complainants to come forward with their allegations.
Meanwhile, the public is left with a void of information as to what kind of evidence is really being blocked in court as a result. The Goldfinch case was sent back to trial, the acquittal overturned, simply because Mr. Goldfinch was permitted to tell the jury that he and the complainant had been “friends with benefits” to give “context” to their relationship.
The conviction in the R.V. case was restored after the complainant was allowed to testify that she remained a virgin, despite being pregnant, and the accused was not permitted to fully cross-examine her on whether or not she’d actually had intercourse with someone else that fateful summer.
In the new Langan case, which will probably go to Supreme Court because one appellate judge dissented, the same text messages that were used by the prosecutor to gain a conviction would have been presumed inadmissible if introduced by the accused without a proper hearing.
While we wait for a final decision on whether or not text messages count as a record with an expectation of privacy, or whether or not evidence of sexual inactivity requires the same evidentiary hearings, thousands of people are stuck in limbo. While judges grapple with the question of whether or not the new legislation is even constitutional every trial outcome, both acquittals and convictions, could be overturned if the judge’s ruling is later deemed incorrect.
It is not easy to completely break the legal system in a country like Canada. It takes a lot of audacity and recklessness to wreak the havoc enacted by the Liberal government with Bill C-51.
Because the new rules of evidence hadn’t been in effect during the cases before the Supreme Court at the beginning of the year, the rulings made in cases like Barton, Goldfinch and R.V. have not had to deal with the impact it will have now that Crown prosecutors have to follow the same onerous pre-trial rules.
Because Bill C-51 was crafted and passed into legislation before these Supreme Court decisions, the consequences on the Crown weren’t taken into consideration when they voted to pass the bill. If parliament had known their new rules would also hobble the prosecution of sexual assault allegations I wonder if they might have paid more attention to the defence lawyers who demanded caution.
As it stands, prosecutors will now have to figure out how to build a case if they aren’t allowed to mention things like a lack of prior sexual history or evidence that the complainant would “never” have agreed to specific sexual acts. Prosecutors may have trouble obtaining or using text messages that complainants wish to rely on. After all, the government expanded the new rules to cover all evidence in a sexual assault trial, not just those of a “sexual nature.”
With the reciprocal requirements now affecting both sides, no evidence from either prosecutors or defence will be deemed admissible without prior permission from a judge. It’s probably the first government in the modern world to think presumptively barring all evidence in a criminal trial was a good idea. Hopefully, the Supreme Court can set this right and fix it quickly.
Meanwhile, what a brave new world."

They’ve tried to convince us that Canada has “stature” in the world and is ‘respected’ internationally.
They’ve talked about “soft-power,” and the strength of our ‘example’ to other countries.
They’ve even claimed that raw military strength and economic leverage no longer really mattered and that by taking a “progressive” position on every possible issue Canada would become a “moral superpower.”
It was all lies.
For some time, Canadians have been realizing how badly the foreign policy elites and political establishment has failed.
In the most recent election, Justin Trudeau even skipped the foreign policy debate, realizing that avoiding the issue altogether was far better for him than the risk of having the elitist consensus demolished on live television.
He managed to narrowly escape in the campaign, barely holding on to power.
And yet, Trudeau is unable to escape the consequences of his weakness, and the weakness of Canada’s foreign policy establishment.
Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are still being held hostage by China.
Trudeau’s latest attempt to secure their release was to ask the United States to make the freedom of Kovrig and Spavor a condition of the Trump Administration signing a phase 1 trade deal with China.
Surely, if “soft-power” mattered and Canada was a “moral superpower,” then Trudeau’s request would be taken seriously, right?
Not so much.
China has openly mocked Trudeau, saying his request was “doomed to fail.” An advisor to China’s State Council said: “Frankly speaking, what Trudeau is saying is nonsense.”
China sees Trudeau and his request as a joke.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently Tweeted about the upcoming U.S.-China phase 1 deal, saying this:
“Had a very good talk with President Xi of China concerning our giant Trade Deal. China has already started large scale purchaes [sic] of agricultural product & more. Formal signing being arranged. Also talked about North Korea, where we are working with China, & Hong Kong (progress!).”
Had a very good talk with President Xi of China concerning our giant Trade Deal. China has already started large scale purchaes of agricultural product & more. Formal signing being arranged. Also talked about North Korea, where we are working with China, & Hong Kong (progress!).— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 20, 2019
At this point, it appears Trudeau’s request isn’t on the radar for the United States.
After being caught on tape mocking Trump at the recent NATO meeting, Trudeau likely has little leverage with the Trump Administration at this point in time.
The key problem here is that Justin Trudeau, many of Canada’s corporate elites, and the Canadian political class are in thrall to the conventional “wisdom” of the foreign policy establishment.
That establishment has decided to make weakness into a virtue, allowed our military power to evaporate, and seek endless compromise while selling out our national sovereignty.
As a result, our nation is left adrift in a world that has decisively rejected “soft-power,” leaving us as a weak, naïve, and frankly irrelevant presence to other nations who actually have real power.
The fact is that many countries around the world are run like ruthless criminal syndicates, and until Canada realizes that, and until our foreign policy establishment is replaced by people who actually understand ruthlessness and understand how dangerous the world is, Canada will continue to suffer the consequences."

In fact, the Conservative base is the strongest bastion of Canadian populism and inclusive nationalism that remains in this country.
The Conservative base, heavily concentrated in the West, believes in low taxes, opposes the carbon tax, wants the rights of law-abiding Canadian gun owners to be protected, and believes that Canadian Confederation is currently heavily biased against Western Canada.
The base is also a powerful political force, as a populist grassroots army of volunteers and individual donors who give the Conservatives the opportunity to be free from undue corporate influence.
The base also ensures the Conservatives a strong chance of winning every national election, as they start with almost 75 seats guaranteed at minimum, a strong foundation to build on.
And yet, the establishment media is pretending the Conservative base doesn’t exist.
That can be seen in the growing effort to push Jean Charest as Conservative Leader.
Charest was the former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, a party that was seen as far too beholden to the establishment.
The PC’s were repeatedly beaten by the more populist Reform Party, which was strong in Western Canada and formed the largest, most powerful part of the re-integrated Conservative Party.
Charest then went on to become the Liberal Premier of Quebec, where he pushed for bigger government, supported carbon taxes and supported gun registries.
In short, Charest’s views on numerous core topics run completely counter to what the Conservative base believes.
The issues isn’t that Charest was once a Liberal, after all, even Stephen Harper and Winston Churchill were Liberals for a while. And Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump were once Democrats.
The issue is that Charest was a Liberal for many years in the prime of his political career, and his views clearly line up with the Liberal Laurentian Elitist Establishment, diametrically opposed to the Conservative base.
Pushing Charest as CPC leader would be the equivalent to expecting that the Liberal base or NDP base would vote for someone who was firmly right-wing. It simply wouldn’t happen, and neither of those parties would even consider it.
The media shows respect to the bases of both the Liberals and the NDP, acknowledging that those party bases deserve a leader who represents their core values.
Yet, when it comes to the Conservatives, the media pretends that the Conservative base doesn’t exist, and acts like they can just foist an establishment creature like Charest on unwilling Conservatives.
That must stop.
The Conservative base deserves respect, and the Conservative base deserves a leader who represents their values and has the ability to make the case for those values and win on the national stage."

Manny Montenegrino, known online as @manny_ottawa, is a beloved and wildly popular tweeter who has been sharing his takes on the Canadian political scene for more than 10 years. His Twitter bio stated, “Truth sounds like hate to those who hate truth.”
The reason for his ban according to Montengrino is probably “hurt feelings.” The Post Millennial reached out to Manny who told us that he “felt compelled to correct the record and entered into a Twitter debate after a mischaracterization of him appeared in his feed. “In the Twitter debate I was civil and factual”, Manny said, “I looked up the Twitter policy and I didn’t violate any of their policies. I don’t post anything offensive, use foul language and I don’t post anything violating terms of Twitter.”
Manny received a message attached to his tweets stating that he was responsible for “violating our rules against abuse and harassment. You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. This includes wishing or hoping that someone experiences physical harm.”
Montenegrino said, “I think because I’m a Trump guy, Twitter was only too happy to knock me off. I only tried to educate and correct the record. I stand up for free speech, fight homophobia, Islamophobia, and as an immigrant, I stand against anti-immigrant sentiment. I believe in fairness and equality but Twitter is not fair.”
Montenegrino, who is a retired lawyer in Ottawa, referred to the significance of the Magna Carta to Canadians and expressed his concern with the world young people will inherit both online and in person. “I’m a guy who believes in the freedom of exchange and discussion, but I’m afraid for what young people are facing … I treat everyone the same, it doesn’t matter if there is a blue check beside your name or not; I will treat everyone the same. My response must have been seen to be aggressive as the truth always is. That’s why I respond the way I do, I want to have a full wholesome discussion with people not just smart ass quips. But that’s what Twitter would rather encourage.”
Twitter has a history of ideological bias when it comes to conservatives such as Paul Joseph Watson, Nike Monroe, Jesse Kelly and David Horowitz. Canada’s Manny Montenegrino is yet another victim of Silicon Valley’s censorship. When asked if he would remove the tweet to regain his account, Manny responded with, “I didn’t even get to see the complaint. Twitter doesn’t let you know what policy you violated or how many people sent in complaints against what you said. In a world of justice, you have to know the complaint. If I were younger and really cared, I would take them to court and undo it, but I am so happy to be off Twitter. It started changing who I was. I’ve been off for a week and I’m so happy about it!”"

Commanders also instructed their officers to “use as much violence toward the gate as you want.” This was prior to the operation to remove the Wet’suwet’en people from the roadblock they had built. The roadblock prevented access to their territories which halted construction of the pipeline.
The Coastal GasLink pipeline is supposed to be 670 km long.
The raid took place on Jan. 7 2019. RCMP dressed in military-green fatigues and armed with assault rifles approached the roadblock and dismantled the gate, arresting 14 people.

Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained in Beijing last December shortly after the top executive at Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, was detained in Canada. Wanzhou is the daughter of Huawei’s founder and was detained on fraud charges after a request from U.S. authorities.
According to the Washington Post, Trudeau mentioned that he asked the states to use the trade deal as leverage in a French-language interview with TVA on Thursday.
In a translated version of the interview, Trudeau said, “We’ve said that the United States should not sign a final and complete agreement with China that does not settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians.”
Kovrig and Spavor have not had access to lawyers or even family members since being in Chinese custody.
Recently, Trudeau and Trump have not been on great terms after footage surfaced of Trudeau and other world leaders talking about Trump in a childish manner.
Trudeau has since addressed the incident during a press conference saying, “Last night I made reference to the fact that there was an unscheduled press conference before my meeting with President Trump. I was happy to be part of it but it was certainly notable.”
Trump responded to the video by calling Trudeau “two-faced” but went on to add that he finds him to be a nice guy.
U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo has noted that Meng will not be used for bargaining in the trade deal conversations with the U.S. and China.
Meng is out on bail and has been living in Vancouver in a mansion. She was accused of giving banks false information about violating U.S. trade sanctions involving Huawei’s dealings with Iran. Meng is now awaiting proceedings.
After Meng’s detention, Beijing and Ottawa relations have not been the same. China has put a halt on importing some Canadian products. They have even gone as far as to sentence a Canadian to death following Meng’s arrest.
This is not the first time China has retaliated in this way against foreign governments after becoming involved in diplomatic disputes."
0,2019-12-19T10:41:56.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/canadas-culture-of-political-apologies,Canada’s culture of political apologies,"The following is an excerpt from The Victim Cult: How the culture of blame hurts everyone and wrecks civilizations, by Mark Milke, published by Thomas & Black, 2019. Milke, PhD., is an independent policy analyst, author of six books, and dozens of studies published in Canada and the United States.
“Have we reached the ultimate stage of absurdity where some people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born, while other people are not held responsible for what they themselves are doing today?” —Thomas Sowell
Canadian politicians agree on virtually nothing except that apologies are owed.
In recent decades, the first high-profile regret for history came from Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, in 1988, for the internment of Japanese Canadians and the government’s theft of their property during the Second World War. Next was a 1990 apology for how the government declared Italian Canadians “enemy aliens” in that same war (after Italy joined the Axis against Canada and her allies). In 2001, the Veteran’s Affairs minister in the Jean Chretien government, Ron Duhamel, expressed official regret for the army’s execution of 23 soldiers during the First World War. In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized for residential schools, where native Canadian children attended (sometimes by force, and sometimes at the request of parents) between the 1880s and 1990s and where sexual and physical abuses occurred. Harper also offered apologies for the 1885–1923 Chinese head-tax; to Ukrainians for internment during the First World War; and also for how the federal government denied entry in 1914 to the Komagata Maru, a Japanese ship with 376 southeast Asian people on board including those who were Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim.
Shortly after coming to office, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau again apologized for the Komagata Maru. (Harper’s apology was given in British Columbia, not in the House of Commons, was the cited reason.) The denial was “a stain on Canada’s past,” said Trudeau in early 2016. Later, in 2017, Trudeau reiterated the Conservative government’s apology for residential schools but for the Newfoundland and Labrador versions. Speaking in Goose Bay, Trudeau used the language of therapy, telling the crowd that it was “not a burden you have to carry alone anymore.” The prime minister told the audience it was his hope that they could “begin to heal—that you can finally put your inner child to rest.”
In November 2018, Trudeau issued three apologies in rapid succession: For the actions of British Columbia’s first chief justice, Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie, who convicted and sentenced five Tsilhqot’in chiefs in 1864 and another in 1865 to death by hanging; for the 1939 rejection of an asylum request from 900 German Jews, 254 of whom later died in the Holocaust; and to gay and lesbian Canadians for past laws but also for the federal government’s practice of outing and firing them from the civil service until the 1990s. In March 2019, the prime minister apologized for how the Inuit in northern Canada were treated for tuberculosis in the mid-20th century and in May 2019 for the imprisonment of Saskatchewan’s Chief Poundmaker, convicted of treason-felony and imprisoned during the 1885 North-West Rebellion. Since Brian Mulroney’s first apology in 1988, at just the federal level, at least 15 apologies have been issued, with eight from the Trudeau government in four years. Justin Trudeau’s apologies were so numerous that even the BBC headlined a news report with the question, “Does Justin Trudeau apologise too much?”
Thinking through regrets
Mixing politics, history, and an apology is often a mistake. There were always nuances in the various regrets, which could support or alternately undermine them. The six Tsilhqot’in chiefs sentenced to the gallows by Judge Begbie faced that fate after they murdered twenty-one men building   a road through Tsilhqot’in territory. Some would defend the six chiefs on the grounds that the killing was a battle in a war against invaders—this was the Trudeau government’s reasoning. Alternately, some of the attackers who murdered the workers (there were 24 and not all were executed) were “singing and merry-making” with the road builders the night before. They also killed more than just the road crew but also those on a pack train along with a lone settler. The issue is further complicated by how Chief Justice Begbie was not unsympathetic to First Nations and others discriminated against by white settlers. As left-wing journalist Stephen Hume wrote in 2017, Begbie spoke Secwepmc and Tsilhqot’in; favoured notions of aboriginal title; opposed settler efforts to displace First Nations by force; ruled against provincial legislation to ensure First Nations women received an equitable share of the estates of their white husbands; and sided with Chinese communities against racist laws. Justice Begbie also often “commuted the expected death sentences for First Nations—something he never did for a non-aboriginal offender.” History is not as simple as politicians would have us believe.
Governments sometimes offer apologies with more caution. When offering the Liberal government’s 2001 regret for the execution of the 23 soldiers during the Great War, Jean Chretien’s government deliberately did not also pardon the soldiers. That would have cast doubt on the judgement of the commanders at the time in the war who ordered the executions, in part to prevent desertions. (One such commander was Capt. George Vanier who served as Canada’s governor-general between 1959 and 1967.) In a 2006 interview, military historian Desmond Morton argued that even the 2001 statement of regret “turned fact into fiction” and unfairly tarnished commanders. “They did it to encourage people to behave,” he remarked. “If everyone who decided to flee, fled, where would the army be?”
The possible gradations left out of most political apologies are purposeful. The point of the numerous mea culpas is to morally preen and take issue with the dead who cannot argue back. It is often excellent politics, at least in the short term. It also leads to hollowed-out, incomplete history, and a simplistic caricature of events. It is the “Disneyfication” of often difficult decisions from another era. Also, while personal apologies are valuable in that they take   the “sting” out of a personal offence, it is not clear that government regrets add much to the overall stock of human compassion. In most instances, the apologies are given in place of dead men who harmed other dead men.
But if everyone today agrees that some act committed long ago was morally beyond the pale, then progress as a species is already evident, at least until the next injury we commit in supreme self-confidence that we, as with every generation, have arrived at peak morality. If there is division on a matter—some think Judge Begbie was wrong to sentence six chiefs to death while others argue road-building without permission on territorial land did not give the chiefs a right to premediated murder—then an apology changes no one’s mind. And the hung men and Judge Begbie are still dead and beyond the reach of our present, political morality plays.

0,2019-12-19T08:51:36.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/how-social-justice-is-making-homelessness-worse-in-seattle,How social justice is making homelessness worse in Seattle,"Seattle has a prolific homeless offenders problem—one made worse by a light on crime approach championed by progressive activists in elected office. The consequences have been dire: Innocent residents and visitors being physically assaulted by criminals with lengthy rap sheets, while the homeless, many dealing with addiction or mental health problems, remain on the streets.
The latest incident to bring attention to Seattle’s progressive leadership problem stems from a leaked video showing a topless dancer giving lap dances at a publicly-funded conference on homelessness last week. How anyone thought this was appropriate tells you how out of touch this city and county can be. However, before that, there was another incident that received much less attention.
Right before Thanksgiving, a homeless man with a lengthy criminal record randomly assaulted a defence attorney outside the King County Courthouse in downtown Seattle. The suspect is Frank Hypolite and he has been arrested on the same block five other times.
As a consequence, presiding judge James Rogers issued an emergency declaration to close the entrance where these assaults keep occurring. After negotiations with the Seattle Police Department, the entrance was reopened this week. The police chief promised increased patrols. But this won’t make a dent in the problem.
Seattle doesn’t have a policing problem in this regard—even with dangerously low staffing numbers. The problem? Criminals don’t serve jail time.

Seattle’s activist city attorney, Pete Holmes, and the county’s prosecutor, Dan Satterberg, refuse to prosecute many crimes allegedly committed by the homeless. They say it lacks compassion to throw someone in jail if they’re dealing with untreated mental illness or addiction.
While there aren’t many voices asking to “criminalize the homeless”—the typical refrain from left-wing activists—there needs to be some consequences for violent behaviour. By releasing homeless criminals back onto the streets, not only are they failing to help get their issues treated, they’re also creating sitting ducks out of passers-by and visitors.
Francisco Calderon has more than 70 convictions. Photo: King County Correctional Facility
One prolific offender, Francisco Calderon, has an astounding 75 convictions for a variety of crimes, including a recent assault on a toddler.   Calderon, who is dealing with mental illness according to his sister, threw a cup of coffee in the child’s face. However, a judge earned public condemnation from Holmes after daring to put Calderon in jail for punching a man in Seattle. This is compassion? Tell that to Calderon’s victims.
Then there is the public defecation. Businesses have recently cried out for help from the city as homeless use sidewalks and business entryways as toilets.
“I’m tired of the defecation, the urination, drug use, accosting customers,” hotel general manager Jeff Gouge of The Arctic Circle Seattle told KOMO-TV. Last week, security footage caught a homeless man defecating outside the window of the hotel restaurant.
“We had someone, just an hour ago, on the other side of the entrance urinate right on the side of the building,” Gouge told the station. “It’s happening too much.”
The problems go beyond the intersection of homelessness and mental illness. It’s also a drug problem.
King County prosecutor Dan Satterberg will not prosecute drug addicts or users caught with up to a gram of a controlled substance, though cops say it’s much more than that. As a result, not only have we seen an increase in overdose deaths, drug dealers roam free.
Speaking to the Washington Post, Satterberg declared he will vigorously prosecute drug dealers. Except it’s hard to prosecute drug dealers who are smart enough to evolve with the policy. Cops have repeatedly told me that dealers will carry fewer products. After they sell out of heroin or meth, they’ll go back to wherever they keep their stash, restock on the product, and go back to dealing. It’s a policy that was adopted in nearby Snohomish County. But after months of the policy failing, their prosecutor, Adam Cornell, announced he’s nixing it. And a new Sheriff was elected, primarily on a message of being tougher on crimes.
What’s worse, in all this, cops have lost any leverage they might have over a drug user they catch. Knowing they won’t be prosecuted, Seattle cops can’t leverage jail time to get information out of the user, to find out who is selling them their product. As a consequence, drug deals are done in the open, ironically impacting the area directly surrounding the King County Courthouse the most, and more users are staying addicted.
But we’re told, over and over again, that this is compassionate. That it’s the social-justice way of dealing with crime. Which, as it turns out, means not dealing with crime at all. Who exactly wins with this approach?

Serious questions raised about Liberal MP’s ties to Islamic regime,"Iranian-born Liberal MP Majid Jowhari’s history of a cozy stance toward his home country took a dark turn last week after he was accused of being a paid agent of the Khamenei regime on Farsi television in the United Kingdom.
The allegation was made by Alireza Sassanian, a freelance journalist and close associate of the late-Iranian intelligence dissident Masoud Molavi who was murdered this past November in Istanbul.
“Masoud talked to me about someone by the name of Majid Jowhari. He’s a member of the Parliament of Canada. He’s from the Liberal Party, representing Richmond Hill,” Sassanian told the programme’s host Alireza Nourizadeh.
Nourizadeh is a journalist, expert in contemporary Iranian history and another Iranian dissident who hosts a weekly program called Window on the Fatherland for the Iran-e Farda (Iran of Tomorrow) network, where Sassanian has been a frequent guest.
In the December 11th episode, the pair discussed the regime’s global influence in the context of Molavi’s killing, which U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed on Iranian assassins.
Molavi had fled the regime to live in Turkey where he published information about the corruption of Iranian officials before he was shot to death in Istanbul by an unknown assailant.
During the 40-minute interview in Farsi, Sassanian said tentacles of Iran’s political influence reached not just into regional governments of Syria and Iraq, but beyond to Canada and “the Democrats in the U.S.”
Shocking indeed. The assertion that there is an Iranian Regime asset inside @JustinTrudeau’s government must be immediately investigated. The Prime Minister owes Canadians a response. This allegation could not be more serious. @rcmpgrcpolice @CSIS https://t.co/RR3OjEUqon— Senator Linda Frum (@LindaFrum) December 17, 2019
“(Molavi) said that Jowhari was in touch with some of the intelligence officers of Iran, and that he even visited the representatives of (Hossein) Taeb and Mojtaba Khamenei. He even received financial support from these people.”
Taeb is a commander of the regime’s intelligence network for the Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) while Mojtaba is the son of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The Canadian man who posted excerpts of the interview to social media Sunday is Kaveh Shahrooz, a Liberal Party member who ran against Jowhari in 2014 for the Richmond Hill nomination and lost.
“Within the Iranian community in Canada there’s an awful lot of rumours about Jowhari’s ties to the regime but this is the first time someone with potential ties to Iranian intelligence has actually come out and stated something about the connection,” explained Shahrooz of why he proliferated the clips on Twitter.
“If people want to attribute this to sour grapes they can, but I think there’s enough questions about this person that people ought to take this seriously and really be concerned about Iranian government’s foreign influence, be it through this MP or be it through other means.”
Shahrooz fled Iran with his family at 10 years of age and now works as a lawyer “fairly active on human rights issues in Iran”, and is a senior research fellow for Macdonald Laurier Institute specializing on in-country foreign influence campaigns.
He said that he has “no idea if the allegations are true but they are consistent with Mr. Jowhari’s public positions of the past”, and as Senator Linda Frum suggested in her retweet of the video, Shahrooz said he, “simply want(s) the RCMP and CSIS to investigate.”
Asked to elaborate on Jowhari’s record, Shahrooz cited his pro-Iran “relation normalization” motion in the House of Commons, courting Iranian politicians in Richmond Hill and more recent social media activity, all widely panned by in-country critics of the regime and opposition MPs.
“When there were mass protests in Iran in 2017, he tweeted that he hoped the Iranian people would sit down with their “elected-government”, the very government that was slaughtering them in the streets, and talk through their issues,” Shahrooz said.
“It gives you a window into how he views the Iranian regime. He’s very sympathetic towards them.”
On Tuesday, TPM made inquires about Jowhari’s mention on Window on the Fatherland to the Liberal Party’s Richmond Hill Riding Association, to Jowhari and the Prime Minister’s Office.
By late-Tuesday afternoon CBC and Postmedia had reported on Jowhari’s full-throated denial of the “false and unfounded” accusations of Sassanian.
“Without a shred of evidence, I have been accused of having connections to officials with the Islamic Republic of Iran,” reads Johari’s statement that TPM received at 11:25 p.m. Tuesday night.
But the Richmond Hill MP met with Iranian officials of a different variety back in November 2016 at his constituency office, while Foreign Affairs was completely unaware he was hosting the delegation of Iranian parliamentarians.
The meeting drew significant criticism at the time and one for which then- Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion’s office publicly disavowed.
Official diplomatic ties between Canada and Iran were severed 2012 after then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper listed the regime as a state sponsor of terror, closed the Canadian embassy in Tehran and tossed their diplomats from Ottawa.
While the United States officially declared the IRGC a terrorist group in April 2019, the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau supported a Conservative motion to do the same thing in June of 2018, but has yet to follow through.
Currently, Canada lists Iran’s al Quds, considered IRGC’s unconventional military wing, as a terrorist group.
Jowhari’s soft-stance on Iran has manifested itself in other ways too noted Richard Rupp, who served as the president of the Liberal’s Richmond Hill riding association between 2013 and 2018, and recalls the Liberal MP’s freshman days as a member of parliament.
“One of his first acts as an MP was to sponsor a petition to re-open the embassies with Iran and re-engage with the regime… which a number of people here felt was questionable,” Rupp told TPM.
“He also flew out to Vancouver to promote this petition. So a number including myself were concerned–why would you do this if our riding is here in Ontario? This may only benefit the riding in a very tangental way.”
Days before the October 21 election, as Iranian diaspora picketed Jowhari’s constituency office for his pro-regime leanings, Rupp was one of five prominent Liberals to sign an email signalling they could not endorse or vote for their Richmond Hill incumbent.
Other signatories included the riding’s former Liberal MPP and cabinet minister Reza Moridi, Bryon Wilfert, former Liberal MP for the riding and Brampton Centre MP Sarkis Assadourian.
“I know him very, very well being his riding president and having seen him in action, I had completely lost confidence in him as an MP and candidate,” said Rupp, who like Shahrooz said he had no proof that Jowhari was a paid asset for Iran.
“I want to be very specific on that. I can’t say he had any connections with the regime whatsoever. But in reading articles in the newspaper and a number of different people in the Iranian community saying things, it does make you wary.”
One of these newspaper articles involved a February 2018 fundraiser Jowhari held that the riding association rejected, then later learned was under investigation by the Elections Commissioner, as reported in the Globe and Mail.
“Let’s just say it was only advertised to a select group of the Iranian community and a number of questions arose from that so the riding association voted down that fundraiser,” said Rupp noting that anti and pro-regime camps among Iranian diaspora is “a very big issue”.
“It’s a big matter in the Iranian diaspora of Richmond Hill. Because Richmond Hill, I believe has the first or second largest percentage of Iranians in Canada,” he noted.
“So there are Iranians who are against the regime and there are Iranians, for whatever reason have connections, or want to maintain positive connections with the regime.”
Both Shahrooz and Rupp said that Jowhari’s questionable conduct as an MP goes beyond Iran, including the contentious fundraiser, a personal bankruptcy that he concealed from riding association members and his lie about professional engineering credentials.
In 2016, Jowhari was called onto the carpet by the Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO) and agreed to offer a public letter of apology and a donation after telling constituents during a 2015 riding debate that he was an engineer.
In his apology, Jowhari wrote that he was a licensed engineer between 1995 and 1999, until it was cancelled for non-payment of dues.
“There are enough issues that I think any other candidate or MP with this background would’ve been jettisoned,” said Shahrooz, noting Jowhari’s election victory in his 905 riding where neighbouring Liberals won by landslides, was by the narrowest of margins; 220 votes.
“So it’s not like he’s immensely popular but he’s widely known to be incompetent and he’s been nothing but a liability for the Liberal Party and yet they stick with him and they allow him to run.”
As of publication, TPM was unable to independently verify allegations made against Jowhari."

These include racism, inequality, same-sex rights, indigenous relations, and climate change.
At the same time, we have begun to see a simple but worrying pattern. While the Liberals never hesitate to demonize those around them, they continuously fall short of expectations.
Reconciliation with indigenous peoples? In theory, sure. But the government will still take children to court because $40,000 in compensation for a lifetime of abuse is, perhaps, “asking for more than we are able to give right now.”
It seems to the Trudeau government that it’s not just veterans who ask for too much, but also the children of Indigenous families who have had their rights violated.
Of course, that is just the beginning.
Team Trudeau, while actively campaigning on the importance of ending gender inequality by bringing strong women into politics, attacked and removed Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott for calling out the government’s breaking of ethics laws with the damning SNC-Lavalin scandal.
I suppose a lack of ethics to the benefit of powerful corporations is only problematic when others do it.
Sadly, once again, this is still only the beginning.
Even when it comes to racist actions, the Liberals judge themselves, and most importantly Trudeau by a different standard.
If someone performs a racist action in the past, they need to resign… unless that person’s name is Justin Trudeau, and they wore blackface more times than they can count. Then an apology is fine, and the decades of racist action no longer matter.
Worryingly, It seems this disastrous problem has now moved past just the party’s direct tendrils and made its way through the nation’s democracy, due to the top-down management of the Liberal government.
For example, as a public servant, if you dare question it, well, then you’ll be reprimanded and put into a position where you could lose your job if you don’t play by their continuously top-down rules. This isn’t a theory; its what happened in Canada, under Trudeau.
According to HuffPost, the Liberal government’s bureaucracy actively went after Manjot Bains, a senior program adviser in Community Support, Multiculturalism and Anti-Racism Initiatives in Canadian Heritage for daring critique the PMs racist decision to put on blackface “when he was a high school student when he worked for a whitewater rafting company, and when he was a teacher at a Vancouver private school gala.”
The federal government seems dedicated to pretending rather than actually solving problems, and when caught, its everyone’s fault but theirs.
This hypocritical thinking extends even to the two largest parts of their platform, the middle class and climate change.
While Trudeau maintains the Conservative party’s environmental goals and likely fails to achieve them, he also takes vacations on private islands, uses two planes during campaigns, and allows the largest polluters to have exemptions from the Carbon tax.
In effect he expects working-class Canadians to just adapt, once again creating a system, where the elite continues to enjoy their luxuries while those without, are forced to make hard cuts for the long-term well being of the nation.
This certainly doesn’t sound like the actions taken by a government that believes the UN report which states there are only 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe. Instead, it seems like the actions taken by a government with lukewarm beliefs, aiming to win votes at all costs.
Canada can’t afford that hypocrisy. Our economy can’t afford it. Our people can’t afford it. And most certainly our climate can’t afford it.
It’s time Canadians woke up and understood that the Trudeau government does not care about progressive politics. They just want your votes."

According to a newly released report by the Conference Board of Canada, uncertainty on global trade, slow global economic growth, and disappointing non-resource business investment in Canada will persist, while the nation skids past a recession.
The Board also pointed to disappointing none-resource business investments which shrank by $2.7 billion since 2014.
While the government has continued to invest massive amounts through deficit spending, the Conference Board has warned that the nation is already running at full capacity, raising potential risks of sky-high deficits should the economy take a dip.
“The fact that federal and provincial governments are running significant deficits when the economy is operating near its full potential creates the risk that deficits will balloon when the economy finally experiences a recession in the years ahead,” said Director Matthew Stewart.
To provide a perspective of how much just the federal government is spending during a time when the economy has been running at peak, team Trudeau is currently expected to add over $100 billion to the national debt over the next four years."

The event was for the Obama Foundation, their stated mission is to inspire, empower, and connect people to change their world.
“Now women, I just want you to know; you are not perfect, but what I can say pretty indisputably is that you’re better than us [men],” he said, adding, “I’m absolutely confident that for two years if every nation on earth was run by women, you would see a significant improvement across the board on just about everything… living standards and outcomes.”
Obama believes most of the world’s problems come from old people, mostly men who are holding on to positions of power.
“You are not there for life, you are not there in order to prop up your own sense of self-importance or your own power,” said Obama.
This is an opinion Obama has held for a while expressing similar views back in 2018 while speaking at the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in Johannesburg, “Women, in particular, by the way, I want you to get more involved because men have been getting on my nerves lately. I mean, every day, I read the newspaper and I just think like, brothers what’s wrong with you guys? What’s wrong with us?”

We’ve all seen the viral imagery of Trump supporters with swollen eyes and people at protests getting hit. In a recent and particularly disturbing instance, a clip went viral of a 14-year-old boy who allegedly had been wearing a MAGA hat being brutally jumped and beaten by classmates on a school bus. The family of the boy and the school superintendent dispute the reasons behind the attack. But violent attacks on Trump supporters happen all the time.
This is a real phenomenon that is becoming normalized and if you are shocked or unaware of it, you are probably only paying attention to news outlets that stand to gain from outright ignoring it.
The second and perhaps equally disturbing component to this phenomenon is the mainstream media’s unwillingness to cover most of these incidents at all. Googling these types of beatings will lead you to almost exclusively conservative websites. That’s a problem. It should not be conservative news when a Trump supporter is beaten. Meanwhile, there was absolutely no hesitation from the media when Jussie Smollett came out with his laughable and since-debunked claim of being beaten by crazed Trump supporters in Chicago.
Regardless of your own political worldview or feelings on Trump, you should be able to see the false narrative the media has been attempting to paint. It is much more convenient for us to believe in the conservative caricature who is going to jump out at you with a noose, rather than the simple reality that not everyone who feels differently than you about the President is an evil person. But of course, it takes a lot less effort and thought processing to write off half of the American population as bigoted and evil.
In a time where liberals and conservatives feel and objectively are more divided than ever, I hope that one of the few things we can come together on is the notion that no one should be physically harmed for their political beliefs. None of us should want to live in a country where you are in literal danger for wearing a hat of support for the sitting President. It is the height of melodrama that the MAGA hat is practically treated as a KKK symbol in some parts of the country. Many folks seem thoroughly dedicated to maintaining this constant level of hysteria.
It seems as if rabid anti-Trumpers will do anything to convince themselves that after 2016, members of the LGBT community and people of color were thrust into a world where they have to fear for their lives when they leave the house. I can only speak from my own experience as a transgender woman who has never been assaulted verbally or physically on the basis of my gender identity. I was, however, assaulted multiple on the streets of Hollywood when I wore a MAGA hat as a social experiment for my YouTube channel.
Both assaults occurred within the timespan of one hour, by separate individuals. It is the only time in my adult life that I had experienced violence and it truly awakened me to the sad state we are in as a country. Regardless of what the media had told me, I realized that it was indeed more dangerous for me to walk the street as a Trump supporter than as a transgender woman. Who would have guessed?"

According to the Finance Department, Canada’s federal budget deficit will continue to increase by billions more this year and the next.
The data released today shows that the Liberals have projected a deficit of 19.8 billion over the last twelve-month period ending in March is now set to hit $26.6 billion. This before it hits 28.1 billion in the following year.
None of the above includes costs for promises made that will be perused in the 2020 budget.
With the debt to GDP ratio rising to 31%, some economists may worry about the long-term stability of the Canadian economy as the Liberal government has been unable to reduce deficit size over the last five years, even though the economy has been growing.
The Liberals notably came into government in their first term by promising only two deficits, each less than $10 billion.
Since then the deficit has only increased, with the second term Liberals projecting an addition of at least $80 billion in new debt over the next four years.
This can be a problem if the nation falls into a recession, as Canada is already spending large sums through deficits to keep the economy growing at a rapid and perhaps unequal pace, with oil-producing provinces still feeling left out.
If a recession hits, some wonder how much more the already deficit extended government would have to spend in order to counteract the drop in consumer and global spending which would follow any larger drop in global economic activity."

According to an investigative report by Global News, Canada has a secret program that allows “high-profile” foreign nationals entry via visa so long as it is in Canada’s national interest, even if they previously were a security concern, took part in war crimes, organized crime, or any other human rights violation.
In total, roughly 3000 individuals have received visas through the program since 2010, with over 2100 being granted since 2015.
When contacted by Global, the government’s only response has been to state the program has been used to “advance Canada’s national interests while continuing to ensure the safety of Canadians” and that recipients of these special visas can work, study and travel in Canada."

With all of that in mind, there’s something else the next leader must have to achieve success:
An understanding of the dark side of human nature.
The unfortunate reality we face is that, in a world that is increasingly divided and dangerous, “niceness” can be a liability.
Without an understanding of both the good and the bad that humans are capable of, a leader can find themselves without the necessary tools to succeed.
For example, Justin Trudeau is a master of hypocrisy, campaigning against “the politics of fear,” while endlessly fear-mongering about the Conservatives.
His hypocrisy is so well-honed at this point that it often works.
The establishment media is also massively stacked in favour of the Liberals and against the Conservatives, and powerful media institutions actively seek to influence elections and keep the Liberals in power by manipulating the information environment.
Much of the pro-Liberal, anti-Conservative bias of the establishment media is deeply-rooted, in large part because journalists themselves tend to be far more left-wing than the average Canadian.
The idea that “reaching out more” to the establishment press will change any of that is absurd, and being “nicer” to the establishment media won’t help the Conservatives a bit.
But it’s on the world stage that an understanding of the dark side of human nature is so essential. It’s often tough for the Canadian political class to really grasp how brutal and ruthless the leaders of other countries can be. And in the rare instances when they do grasp it, they are so weak that they sell out for money instead.
The obvious example here is China, who didn’t hesitate to kidnap and hold hostage two Canadians in response to us fulfilling an extradition request from the United States. While Canada’s Citizens are held in torture-like conditions, China’s Meng Wanzhou is living in a mansion.
Many countries look at “niceness” and “collaboration” in the face of threats as weakness, and seek to take advantage of leaders who appear weak, which is the exact situation Canada is in.
Ruthless regimes won’t hesitate to do terrible things to Canada and to Canadian citizens, and we must never forget this.
Any prospective Conservative leader is also a prospective Prime Minister, meaning they must have the willingness to take ruthless measures if necessary in defence of Canadian citizens and Canada’s national interests.
And the pressure is rising. Canada’s political class went all-in on the “soft-power” approach, eschewing a strong military and strong domestic economy in favour of endless treaties, elitist conferences, and an obsession with increasing our reliance on foreign trade.
Yet, the world has gone in exactly the opposite direction, leaving Canada exposed, vulnerable, and divided in an increasingly dangerous world.
The next Conservative Leader must have the toughness to deal with this danger before it’s too late."

The protesters held anti-Boris Johnson signs distributed by the Socialist Workers Party. Others, wearing masks, brandished antifa flags.

Our politicians are addicted to spending. Even though they speak poetically about their good intentions and virtue signal whilst cheque-signing on our behalf, much of that spending is wasteful and sinks us further into debt.
Here are five phrases that usually indicate that a politician is about to waste your money.
1) Politicians will say they’re “investing”
When politicians say they’re investing government money, what they really mean is that they’re spending taxpayer dollars. Unfortunately, politicians at all levels of government in this country have a poor track record in this regard.
In Newfoundland, the government lost $260,000 when it tried to operate a Tim Hortons. Likewise, the Ontario government lost $42 million trying to sell marijuana.
Given that governments can’t make money selling double-doubles or weed brownies, they should let taxpayers keep more of their own money to invest it themselves.
2) “It’s not a spending problem–it’s a revenue problem!”
Imagine saying that in the context of your own life – that it’s not your fault you spent so much, it’s just that your job doesn’t pay what you’d like to spend. Unfortunately, our politicians just keep adding to our credit card bill.
A recent Ontario government report shows why it is in fact a spending problem. It found that Ontario would have spent $330 billion less in the 15-year period the former Liberal government was in power if it had simply kept spending in line with population growth.
Instead, spending increased in real terms by $2,200 per person, and now Ontario’s debt has surpassed $350 billion, making the province the largest subnational debtor on the planet.
Politicians love painting deficits as a revenue problem so they can raise taxes. Don’t fall for it. Tell politicians to manage their own budgets instead of taking more out of yours.
3) Politicians say they’re spending to “help the middle class”
While big government apologists like to pretend all of our tax dollars go toward vital services such as health care and education, the reality is that politicians will often take tax money from hard working Canadians to hand it over to large, profitable corporations.
Take for example the $12 million the Trudeau government gave to Loblaws to buy more energy efficient fridges (even though the company posted net earnings exceeding $800 million that fiscal year). That’s nothing in comparison to the $4 billion of taxpayer money that has been given to Bombardier though, a company owned by one of Canada’s wealthiest families worth close to $3 billion.
Taxes are the single largest expense for most Canadians, taking up approximately 45 percent of the average Canadian’s annual household income. If politicians really wanted to help the middle class, they’d stop giving corporate welfare handouts and instead lower our taxes.
4) Politicians justify their overspending by saying they’re on “a responsible path to budgetary balance”
Translation: “We’re going to keep adding to the debt for the next few years at least.” There’s simply nothing responsible about overspending, especially in good economic times.
In fact, it’s very irresponsible for politicians to ignore the opportunity costs of running up large debts. For example, this year Ontario will spend about $13 billion on interest payments. That’s more money than it will spend on colleges and universities put together!
Politicians should stop making excuses as to why they can’t balance budgets, and they should start paying down the debt.
5) Politicians say “we can keep spending as long as the debt-to-GDP ratio stays in check”
Although this is a favourite excuse used by our current prime minister, the reality is that this economic ratio isn’t reliable. For example, if Canada were to encounter tough economic times and our debt were to increase more sharply than planned, the ratio would be thrown out of whack. All of a sudden, we’d be in a position where we’d be saying “wow, we really need to pay down debt, but now we’re not in a financial position to do so.”
Conversely, even if our GDP were to increase sharply thereby lowering the ratio relative to our G7 counterparts, it doesn’t necessarily follow that more spending is justifiable or a good idea.
Canadians live within their means. It’s time our politicians followed suit."
0,2019-12-13T05:39:56.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/cbc-should-focus-on-canadian-content-not-selling-corporate-products,"CBC should focus on Canadian content, not selling corporate products","Have you ever wanted your taxpayer-subsidized state broadcaster to also become the person selling you corporate goodies?
Well, you’re in for a treat!
Since the CBC’s mandate does not block the state broadcaster from competing with private media, it has for years been using your taxpayer dollars to subsidize reach and compete for advertising dollars.
They have been doing this in an industry that is already rapidly shrinking due to the onslaught of large scale ad platforms such as Google, Facebook, and now Amazon. Those three firms notably take 70% of all digital ad spend.
Interestingly, while the organization has opened its advertising offerings, it continues to rapidly lose clients and viewers, with the company shedding more than half its ad revenue over the last five years.
In that time, its domain has seen less traffic than sites like Narcity, while its high-end news broadcast The National continues to be trounced in every market by competitors like CTV.
When you look at just how bad the CBC is losing viewers in comparison to the competition, its quite obvious that while Canadians are happy to support a potential state broadcaster, they do not actually find use from the current content plan or business model put forward.
In many ways, it seems the continued failure of the CBC comes because of its model.
Instead of focusing on creating content that is predominantly and distinctively Canadian and actively contributing to the flow and exchange of cultural expression, mother corp has bunkered down and done almost everything it can to ruin its own path to growth.
For example, where the company could follow the path of “Letterkenny” and “Trailer Park Boys,” creating high-impact video capable of defining Canadian content and distributing it through international platforms such as Netflix or Hulu, its president decided to leverage your tax dollars and go at it alone, while bizarrely describing the organization as a form of colonization… seemingly forgetting to true brutality and lack of consent that came from colonialism and its institutions.
That comment led to articles panning the company’s president for attempting to rebrand the broadcaster’s own complacency as colonialism coming from the United States.
Of course, the problems don’t stop at complacency.
The CBC also actively ensures that at least one-third of Canadians recoil from all programming due to its desire to waddle into the political discussions of the nation in what can only be described as a clearly biased fashion.
During the 2019 election, for example, the CBC sued the Conservative Party of Canada for using excerpts from its leaders’ debates in campaign material, while naming Rosemary Barton—a debate moderator—on the lawsuit itself.
Outside of the public callouts for bias, those with an understanding of intellectual copyright law such as Michael Geist repeatedly stated that the use of the footage was likely covered by fair dealing provisions. If Geist is correct, the CBC is now not just politically biased, it is also wasting taxpayers’ funds to clog up the court system during a national election.
With so many clear flaws its no wonder the company is failing, even as it continues to get massive government funding.
The average Canadian does not want to have biased politics or poorly designed corporate messaging from the broadcaster we already pay for with our taxes.
Its time the CBC stopped wasting resources competing with private media, and instead focused on producing high-quality Canadian content which actively defines and exports Canadian culture."

Following his announcement, reports have said a leadership race will be held early next year.
While Labour dropped, ensuring a steady Brexit, the SNP managed large gains winning 48 out of 59 seats in Scotland, setting the nation up for a second independence referendum.

Some are suggesting this story might have ultimately let to Scheer’s resignation.
Scheer has since stepped down as leader of the Conservative Party, but he will not fully resign until the party has a replacement to fill the position.
According to some senior Conservative members, Scheer’s use of the Conservative Party of Canada funds was improper.
While in the House of Commons, Scheer said, “I just informed my colleagues in the Conservative caucus that I will be resigning as the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada and I will be asking the Conservative Party national council to immediately begin the process of organizing a leadership contest.”
“In order to chart the course ahead in the direction this party is heading, the party needs someone who can give 100 percent.”
Dustin van Vugt, the Executive Director of the Conservative Party of Canada wrote a statement saying, “All proper procedures were followed and signed off on by the appropriate people.”
Van Vugt talked about the party covering some of Scheer’s costs in the statement saying, “As is the normal practice for political parties, the Party offered to reimburse some of the costs associated with being a national leader and re-locating the family to Ottawa.”
Prime Minister Trudeau also commented on the situation tweeting, “Andrew, I wish you all the best in your next steps — in the house and beyond. On behalf of Canadians, Thanks for your service and commitment to building a better future.”

According to the Elections Canada Act, there are not specific rules in place for these circumstances.
Some are confused about the situation seeing that Scheer’s average salary has been approximately $170,000 to $180,000 for the past 15 years.
Michael Spratt, an Ottawa lawyer said, “It may be off-brand for the Conservatives, but I don’t think any reasonable person would say that it’s a criminal offence to spend a salary top-up on personal items.”
Doug Ford also commented on Scheer’s resignation saying, “I wish Andrew Scheer all the best as he undertakes this new chapter in his life, and thank him for his service as the head of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition and leader of the Conservative Party.”
Jamie Ellerton–longtime Conservative political strategist and public relations strategist at Conaptus Ltd.–said, “I know that he in more recent weeks had finally started reaching out to caucus candidates, close friends, longtime [party members] and I think he finally realized how tenuous his grasp on the leadership was, and it’s my understanding the family indeed came to the decision to do it this way.”
“But the idea that grassroots Conservative Party donations–$25 and $50 [donations]–is paying for his kids … to go to private school is just beyond the pale.”"

The survey polled 1,499 Canadians and found that Canadians’ positive views of trade with China are starting to wane. The now yearlong imprisonment of two Canadians by Beijing was a recent development in the changing attitude towards the super power.
Many Canadians responded with concerns for human rights in China, and seven-in-ten felt the rule of law should take greater precedence in our relationship. That number is up from the last time Angus Reid polled Canadians on the issue back in February 2019, when 62 percent of people said the same.
In 2015, the poll found that 62 percent said that we should increase trade ties with China in the future, that number dropped by 40 percent this year, now only 22 percent of people feel that way.
Two thirds of Canadians now hold an unfavourable view of China, a number that was only 51 percent back in 2018.
Ottawa has had close ties with Beijing in the past due to the country’s roaring economy needing lots of natural resources.
During Chretien’s time as Prime minister he sent many large delegations of cabinet ministers and government officials on trade junkets to China.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited China on a state visit back in 2017 in an attempt to kick-start free trade talks with Beijing but the trip was ultimately unsuccessful.
Trade only looks increasingly bleak with the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and detentions of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.
Ninety percent of respondents said China can’t be trusted on human rights and the rule of law.
The overall views on trade with China were mixed. While respondents were more likely to acknowledge that trade with China has a negative impact on our economy and communities they also felt it was to Canada’s economic benefit as a whole.

With Scheer out, many have begun to wonder who will be the interim leader and who will run in the following leadership race.
With interim leaders normally staying out of leadership races, multiple high ranking officials will have to weigh their options and decide if they would rather keep the party united, or choose to run as Andrew’s potential replacement. Some pundits believe Conservative insiders such as Erin O’Toole or Peter Mackay could be gunning for that position, due to their brand power and instances which have occurred since the election of Trudeau.
For example, Peter Mackay has harshly criticized the party’s campaign, comparing it to missing on an open net, while O’Toole has voiced his disappointment with results in Ontario, especially with the loss of key figures such as Lisa Raitt.

With several ambassadors over to the White House, he shot back against Justin Trudeau as well as France’s President Macron.
Trudeau had mocked Trump during a “hot mic” moment, and the video circulated widely on social media. In it, the leaders of allied nations gossiped about Trump liking to do lengthy press conferences. “He was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference at the top,” Trudeau said, referring to Trump apparently keeping him waiting. “You just watch his team’s jaws drop to the floor.” Trump responded to the video the next day by calling Trudeau “two-faced”.
Trump said that Trudeau had “no smarts,” “zero toughness”, and that he was “all fluff”, according to a source present who spoke to The Daily Beast. Trump clearly doesn’t like Trudeau, who he sees as phony, and referred to him as “such a child” and a “total baby”.
Many allied leaders purportedly don’t like Trump. When he spoke about Trudeau and Macron, ambassadors to those nations were reportedly “visibly uncomfortable”. Trump was undeterred in his commentary, but senior White House officials reiterated the friendship between allied nations."

As soon as The Post Millennial was reached on Monday the correction was issued. We regret the error.
The Liberal government continues its push for bans on guns?—but they aren’t very clear on what exactly that means.
Many are perplexed by the proposed ban on certain gun models.

Asked at a Senate Committee last April how Bill C-71 could be improved,  Chief Palmer’s reply included “more restrictions on certain specialized military weapons like certain rifles.”
When the Liberal government announced its proposed ban of some semi-automatic guns, the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police expressed support: “Ontario’s police leaders support a prohibition on all military-designed assault rifles. In our view, these weapons have no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada’s military and law enforcement.”
Blair’s spokesperson also provided The Post Millennial with several references of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police (CACP) as far back as 1977 calling for a ban of assault rifles.

In regards to the Liberals’ proposed handgun ban, the annual meeting of Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police didn’t see its efficacy in August, as reported by CBC. The consensus was given in an interview with the CBC by Vancouver Police Chief Adam Palmer, who stated that in the majority of cases involving gun violence, the gun in question was already illegal in the first place.
“People can’t be naive to the realities of how it works with organized crime and smuggling,” said Police Chief Palmer. “There will always be an influx of guns from the United States to Canada. Heroin is illegal in Canada too, but we have heroin in Canada.”
“In every single case there are already offences for that,” Palmer said in Calgary, following the meeting. Palmer is the president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police.
ADs
“They’re already breaking the law and the criminal law in Canada addresses all those circumstances,” said Palmer. “The firearms laws in Canada are actually very good right now. They’re very strict.”
The handgun ban the Liberals are proposing wouldn’t be at the federal level due to the high expense of a buyback program as there are already 900,000 guns legally owned in Canada. This strategy would also only target law-abiding handgun owners. Instead, the Liberal plan would leave it to the individual municipalities to regulate the parameters that best work for them.
This poses a number of questions around how such laws would be implemented, according to professor and constitutional scholar at the University of Ottawa Carissima Mathen when speaking to the CBC earlier this year. The ban would come with the risk of punishment, which would fall under criminal law, and that is federal jurisdiction, whereas municipalities look to provincial law for guidance. The ban would therefore require all three levels of government to cooperate, according to Mathen.
ADs
Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford said that his party rejects the idea of a handgun ban in Toronto, saying it would unfairly punish legal firearms owners, when the majority of gun crimes are committed with illegal firearms, many smuggled in from the US.
Chief of Police for Toronto Mark Saunders seemed to support Ford as well in a recent interview with CBC Radio estimating that 80 percent of illegal guns seized on the city’s streets can be traced to sources in the US.
In a previous interview in the summer of 2018, Blair told the CBC host that gun bans do not work, citing his experience as the former Toronto Police chief. Since becoming the minister of public safety he’s reversed his position.

The Stormont County town windmill project was nearly complete with many of the planned 29 turbines already constructed. That came to an abrupt halt on Monday when Minister Jeff Yurek revoked the approval, citing a threat to the local bat population.
Several of the turbines were ready to begin generating power and the project had been previously approved by the Environmental Review Tribunal. Nation Rise Wind Farm is a subsidiary of the multinational EDP Renewables, their North American headquarters is in Texas.
“This was not an easy decision to make,” Yurek said in a press release. “While I agree with most of the conclusions of the tribunal, I disagree with the tribunal’s conclusions with respect to the degree of harm that will be caused to local bat species by the project.
“I am therefore altering the tribunal’s decision based on my conclusion that the project will cause serious and irreversible harm to bats, and I revoke the approval.”
The Environmental Tribunal held weeks-long hearings to look at objections to the project that covered a range of issues. It’s been a rather divisive issue in the community and the township has twice voted against being a “willing host” for the project.
There are a variety of reasons people complain about wind turbines in their community.  The eye sore, the claim that vibrations caused by them bring on migraines, the price of real estate drops instantly and as well the effects on the local wildlife.
Yurek decision came seven months into the projects construction, telling EDP Renewables that he had the authority to “confirm, alter or revoke” the Environmental Review Tribunal’s approval, “as I consider in the public interest.” His reasoning was also based on the potential harm to the wildlife “in the context of the minimal contribution the project is likely to have on the electricity supply in Ontario.”
The tribunal had ruled such risks to the various bat populations were negligible.
“I am therefore altering the tribunal’s decision based on my conclusion that the project will cause serious and irreversible harm to bats, and I revoke the approval.” said Yurek.
The colonies of bats include big brown bats, hoary bats and little brown bats, which are on the Species at Risk Ontario List. The fear is that the bats will fly into the turbine blades.  Yurek admits that one while one can’t know the full extent of the harm, it’s better to err on the side of caution.
“This power project has been very divisive for our community; now North Stormont can again be a good place to grow,” said Maragret Benke in a statement. a founding member of the grassroots organization Concerned Citizens of North Stormont. The group appealed the approval and reached out to the Minister for help.
In a statement provided to the Standard-Freeholder, EDP wrote. “This unprecedented decision means the (approval) that was issued by the minister’s own staff, defended by ministry legal counsel and subsequently ratified by the Environmental Review Tribunal is no longer in effect,” reads a statement from the company. “Decisions of this nature should be based on science and law, yet there was no expert testimony or evidence presented at the tribunal or to the minister that would provide a reasonable rationale for the minister’s decision.”
The issue of what risk the wind farm poses to bat populations was discussed at length during tribunal hearings held in Finch, in August of 2018.
“This power project has been very divisive for our community; now North Stormont can again be a good place to grow,” said Maragret Benke, a founding member of the grassroots organization Concerned Citizens of North Stormont.

And with it now being a year since Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested and held hostage by communist China, such a moment has arrived.
The clearest example is what happened to Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman, who Tweeted what he apparently thought would be an innocuous photo of his meeting with China’s ambassador to Canada Cong Peiwu.
Bowman was absolutely slammed for the Tweet, which went so far as to “thank” the ambassador for the meeting and mentioned working on “human rights,” while completely ignoring China’s horrific human rights record and failing to mention anything about Canada’s detained Citizens.
Bowman was totally ratioed, with over 500 comments and just a couple-dozen retweets. Bowman was slammed by some MPs, and even by Canada’s former ambassador to China.
But it was the response of regular Canadians that really stood out. People from across the political spectrum were outraged by Bowman’s fawning weakness.
The response reflected something that has been bubbling below the surface among Canadians: A real awakening to the danger posed by communist China, and a sense that enough is enough.
We Canadians are generally an easy-going people, but we have a strong inherent sense of right and wrong. And while the Canadian political and business elites may be able to overlook China’s actions, the Canadian People are not overlooking it.
Canadians have turned against China’s communist government, with surveys showing 90 percent having a negative view of the government led by Xi Jinping.
Whether it’s the destruction of freedom in Hong Kong, holding Canadians hostage, putting millions of Uighurs in concentration camps, forced organ harvesting, or the Orwellian surveillance state, Canadians are looking at China and seeing a country that simply doesn’t share our values, and is in many ways hostile to Canada itself.
There was a time when someone like Brian Bowman could have gotten away with his fawning Tweet, but that time has passed. Sooner or later, Canada’s elites will be forced to realize that they can’t hide the truth about China’s government, and they can’t suppress the real views of Canadians.
The pressure is mounting for a tougher approach to China, for reducing our reliance on China, and to move towards a political and economic decoupling from the ruthless communist State. Whether it starts happening now or down the road, the demands of the Canadian People will be translated into policy one way or another."

“The reason why we publicize this, we believe, is it’s in taxpayers’ interests to know,” Education Minister Stephen Lecce said.

In response, Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation(OSSTF) president Harvey Bischof has said the Ford government is inflating numbers by applying his members’ demands to the entire sector.
Currently, the Ford government has said its $7 billion projection is based on union demands such as cost-of-living adjustments to salaries and benefits, maintaining previous class sizes, as well as other costs.
The government has said it had to apply costs to the entire sector as benefits given to one education union would more than likely be given to others. For example, CUPE which has already signed a deal has a “me-too” clause around salaries, which allows the union to ask for increases if others in the industry get them.
While unions continue to ask for data to be presented on a case by case basis, the Ford government appears to dead-on putting forward industry level costs, with both hoping to increase the importance of their argument.
With negotiations ongoing, we’ll have to wait and see how the public alongside those involved react to the ongoing negotiations over teachers’ contracts, including both high school and elementary teachers.
Elementary teachers in Ontario’s English public schools have notably ramped up their own job action on Tuesday, by moving into a new phase of work-to-rule, were teachers would not plan field trips or distribute letters and memos."

The Auschwitz concentration camp was set up by the Nazis during World War II to intern and kill Jews, Romanis, Socialists, Communists, Soviets, Poles, and other “undesirables.”
The camp, located in Poland, was liberated by the Soviet army after their decisive victory in the Battle of Stalingrad.
ADs
While the memorial to the camp serves as a chilling reminder to the horridness of Nazi atrocities, it has also begun expunging any mention of Polish complicity in the Holocaust.
While a great number of Poles bravely fought the Nazis and saved countless innocent lives, many were also involved in abetting the Nazis in their genocidal campaign.
In June 2018, the Polish Parliament passed a law that made it illegal to mention, reference, or acknowledge Polish abetment to, and complicity in, the Holocaust.

Twitter user Howard Lovy, who had family killed in the Holocaust, objected to a tweet released by Auschwitz Memorial that put the blame of the Holocaust solely on “German Nazis.”
I have noticed @AuschwitzMuseum is always careful to lay specific blame on ""German Nazis."" It's a reflection of the official Polish government line that Poles, themselves, were not responsible.

In response, Auschwitz Memorial’s twitter replied with a denial of the Polish complicity in the act. Lovy rebuked the page by saying that many collaborators helped the Nazis enact their genocidal policies.

“It’s part of a larger attempt by the nationalist government in Poland to absolve Poland of all responsibility for the Holocaust,” he said. “The social media people at Auschwitz are actually complying with a law in Poland that forbids them from blaming Poland for the Holocaust.”

Therrien’s 2019 annual report concludes outdated rules permitted StatCan’s surreptitious data-sharing deal – since halted according to Therrien – Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal, and for Equifax’s massive data breach to go unpunished; all of which have compromised the privacy of millions of Canadians.
“It’s no longer whether laws should be modernized, but how,” Therrien said during a Tuesday press conference in Ottawa, highlighting how Canada’s two-decade-old regulations threatened not only fundamental privacy rights, but international trade and the democracy itself.
“We have a crisis of trust,” he said of how obsolete laws have made the entire country vulnerable in an age of online banking, social media and instant communications.
“Terms and conditions are a less than a meaningful form of consent,” Therrien said of Facebook’s and others social media players’ shoddy privacy standards.
“And it’s untenable that Facebook is allowed to (view) my findings as mere opinions.”
In his report, Therrien describes the social media company’s privacy framework as “empty, and their vague terms were so elastic that they were not meaningful for privacy protection”, and is calling for “a set of enforceable rights and obligations” for data sharing.
“The stark contradiction between Facebook’s public promises to mend its ways on privacy and its refusal to address the serious problems we’ve identified – or even acknowledge that it broke the law – is extremely concerning,” writes the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
During his opening remarks and the following question and answer session with reporters, Therrien said our trading relations with the European Union and others could also be jeopardized without any corrective legislation.
“Canada’s laws were equivalent with European Union in 2000,” said Therrien who said this standard would be reviewed by the EU next year.
“So that (trading) status at risk if Canadian laws are not updated and that would put trade exchanges at risk between Canada and the other countries.”
But the extended Q&A with reporters revealed how toothless Therrien’s office actually is, apart from the ability to name and shame, as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner did in its first annual data breach report at the end of October.
Mandated by The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, of Canadian banks, airlines and telecommunications firms obligated to report such breaches, there were 680 security hacks between Nov. 1, 2018, and Oct. 31, 2019, that exposed the personal information of more than 28 million people.
This included the Desjardins data breach that compromised the personal information of three million Canadian customers, including social insurance numbers, as well as a similar incident involving Capital One and as many as six million Canadian victims.
In Therrien’s annual report and during his press conference, the privacy commissioner said that Facebook basically ignored him and that there is nothing in the way of fines or quasi-judicial remedies for his federal office to levy against the social media giant, nor Equifax.
“Fines are part of the trick,” said Therrien whose report recommendations also advise tightening rules on what Statistics Canada is permitted to do with personal information under the law.
“On the one hand, Statistics Canada and policymakers have a legitimate need to lawfully access data and to generate timely and up-to-date statistics to inform sound decision-making. On the other hand, individual Canadians are rightly concerned that there must be appropriate limits,” reads Therrien’s report.
“Its authority to collect personal information indirectly from private sector companies is outdated, allows for overly broad collection, and is unsuited for today’s world of big data analytics, where privacy concerns have taken on a new and ever-present dimension.”
While the Equifax breach impacted 19,000 Canadians, Facebook 600,000, to cap it all off, current federal law allows Statistics Canada access to your personal banking and credit union data  – that’s sensitive information on tens of millions of Canadians – without your consent, and there’s nothing illegal about it.
“To their credit, Statistics Canada decided to suspend the project and work with us…to limit collection and the intrusiveness,” said Therrien who earlier referred to the totality of banking data made available to StatCan as, “highly sensitive…paint(ing) an intrusively detailed portrait of spending habits, lifestyles and private interests.”
In Canada, Equifax’s will face just six years of monitoring while in the UK, the company was handed the maximum $1 million (USD) fine for the same incident and in the United States, Equifax cut a deal with federal regulators that included spending $1.5 billion to upgrade its cybersecurity and practices.
As for Facebook, Therrien said the Privacy Commission is “heading to Federal Court” for an enforcement order against the internet firm “to correct its privacy practices”."

The image was discovered on Reddit over the weekend and Harden appears smiling beside sign baring the obscenity.
NDP leader Andrea Horwath condemned the action calling it “absolutely not acceptable,” while adding that Harden offered an apology to the premier.  His apology came Monday during Question Period.
Premier Ford accepted Harden’s apology.
“I’m glad that he apologized to the premier. It’s never appropriate to have that scenario unfold and I’m glad that the premier accepted the apology,” Horwath told CTV News on Tuesday.
“We believe in raising the decorum of our political discourse. It’s clear based on their past and current behaviour that the NDP caucus do not share this goal,” spokesperson Ivana Yelich said in a statement.
Horwath herself can relate as she was caught posing with a protester outside Queen’s Park who was holding a sign that read “#F*** Ford,” earlier this year.
“I didn’t read the fine print on the bottom of that sign and I have apologized personally to Mr. Ford,” Horvath said.
Harden is taking that position as well saying he didn’t realize what the sign said and as soon as he saw it, he realized that it was a problem.
Horwath has encouraged her New Democrat MPPs to read signs being held by protesters before taking pictures.
“We’ve asked our MPPs on a couple of occasions to be very careful about that because this is exactly the outcome that can occur and it looks bad on everybody, it’s just not appropriate,” Horwath said."

According to a motion tabled by Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Ottawa will increase the personal income tax exemption by $2,000, to $15,000.
The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act would ensure that Canadians who make under $147,000 a year would pay no taxes on the first $15,000, with benefits being spread out over four years.
Interestingly, given the wording of the motion, a dual-income family earning nearly $300,000 would receive the full tax cut.
While some wealthy Canadians would receive the cut, nearly 1.1 million Canadians would pay no tax at all as a result of the increase.
Based on the government’s own estimates, implementing the cut will cost government revenues of $3 billion in the first year, rising to $6 by 2023.
While any tax cuts will be sure to be received well by Canada’s rather overtaxed population, especially when you look at the average tax rates across our southern neighbour, the timing of the cut may worry deficit hawks.
As of now, Canada is on track to hit a $27.4 billion dollar annual deficit, multiple times higher than what the Trudeau government promised, and on track to balance no sooner than two decades from now.
With 22 years needed to balance, according to the nation’s Finance Department, Canada could be in a problematic situation should a global recession occur."

According to the review committee, the sanctions occurred because of Russia’s failure to cooperate with the probe into the nations doping problems.
WADA President Sir Craig Reedie said: “The ExCo’s strong decision today shows WADA’s determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis, thanks to the Agency’s robust investigatory capability, the vision of the CRC, and WADA’s recently acquired ability to recommend meaningful sanctions via the Compliance Standard which entered into effect in April 2018. Combined, these strengths have enabled the ExCo to make the right decisions at the right time.
The ban notably follows Russian whistleblower Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov earth-shaking comments exposing the nations doping cover-ups."

She’s an avid hunter and sport shooter. She resides in Ottawa and enjoys spending time with her children and grandson at the range and hunting camp.
Canadian gun owners find themselves in turmoil, once again being threatened with forced confiscation of their legally acquired property. Why? Because we have a Liberal government, again, who will do anything they think pleases their voters and possibly gains them a wedge issue to add more voters onto their team, by any means necessary.
The 30th anniversary of Canada’s worst multiple victim mass shooting has come and gone. The memorials to the 14 women who lost their lives on December 6, 1989 were packed with people, standing in solidarity, honouring these victims. This is as it should be.
So why bans now? One answer–the outrage mob, and the Liberals are happy to bend a knee to it. Anti-gun lobby groups have been applying tremendous pressure on the government to ban semi-auto firearms for months leading up to the anniversary; it’s paid off. They have a promise from the Liberal elite that they will finally punish gun owners for that decades-old-crime by banning the type of gun used in the shooting, and others like it. The “list” of guns on the government’s radar has not been published as of yet, but gun owners wait with bated breath to see if theirs are on the list.
The idea of picking and choosing guns from a list due to their notoriety shows Canadians this isn’t about public safety; it’s about pacifying the rage mob. The infamous Ruger Mini 14 that was used that fateful day was never again used in a mass shooting, in fact mass shootings are rare in Canada and hunters and ranchers have used the Mini 14 for decades since then without issue. It’s a semi auto, magazine-fed hunting style rifle that is affordable, easy to clean and reliable. It functions the same as any other semi auto rifle, and in Canada they are all pinned to a maximum of five rounds of ammunition.
So, the Liberal plan is to skim through the FRT (Firearms Reference Table), a list of guns in Canada, consult with the  outrage mob, and pluck this gun or that one and put them on “the list” according to their notoriety alone. Imagine crafting policy about anything else in this manner.
What of drunk driving? Ban the Toyota Corolla or the Honda Civic because they are involved in the most fatal accidents? Or maybe ban Vodka and Whiskey because they are the vector most often used? This kind of policy development almost seems infantile to those who understand what they are actually doing.
The outlier here is the AR-15, likely the most misunderstood rifle of all time, a gun that has never been used for a mass shooting in this country.  We found one case of it being used in a crime. Louise Russo was shot during a botched mob hit at a North York sandwich shop in 2004. The mob hitman used a stolen AR-15. No licensed gun owner has ever committed a crime with one, ever, and no mass shootings were ever committed with one in Canada. But rest assured it’s on “the list”. 80,000 AR-15’s are owned across Canada by licensed, RCMP-vetted gun owners, every one of them registered, pinned to a maximum of five rounds and are confined to be used solely at RCMP approved ranges. Their downfall is their notoriety, nothing more.
The biggest tragedy of this entire mess is the resources and focus wasted on buying legal guns out of the safes of gun owners rather than investing that $600 million-plus in a credible way to combat crime.
None of that matters to a government who is content to trade it’s integrity, and your safety, for political cheap points. We are witnessing political theatre replacing evidence-based policy decisions.
The outrage mob celebrates, and Trudeau’s administration panders to them despite knowing better."

However, neither Cernovich nor Hegseth’s tweets included the manifesto. Twitter declined to answer any further questions on the justification for their suspensions.
Following the Pensacola Navy Base shooting having been deemed a terror attack, multiple journalists and media personalities have been suspended from Twitter for reporting details on shooter Mohammed Alshamrami.
Filmmaker Mike Cernovich, The Post Millennial editor-at-large Andy Ngo, and Fox host Pete Hegseth are among those who have been suspended from Twitter for utilizing Alshamrami’s manifesto or social media excerpts to speculate on his motivation for carrying out the deadly attack.
Both Cernovich and Hegseth were suspended for posting excerpts from Alshamrami’s social media, which included disturbing posts indicating the shooting was motivated by anti-American and anti-Israel sentiments.
Earlier today the Saudi terrorist tweeted out his motivation for today’s attack.

I posted a screen cap of the tweet, because this information is clearly newsworthy.

Twitter forced me to delete the delete. pic.twitter.com/sYx9cmHvlr— Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) December 7, 2019
Andy Ngo was suspended pending he delete a tweet which included a copy of Alshamrami’s manifesto, the copy of which was made public by SITE—a non-governmental organization that monitors white supremacist and jihadist terror threats.
While Cernovich’s account was restored following the removal of the offending tweet, Pete Hegseth and Andy Ngo’s accounts remain suspended, appeals unresponded to by Twitter as of yet.
According to the Twitter Terms of Service, promoting or providing media intended to further a terrorist organization’s goals is a violation of the platform’s policies, leading to an immediate, permanent suspension. However, the terms of service also state that discussion of terrorism for “clearly educational or documentary purposes” does not constitute a violation.

Now Ed the Sock, otherwise known as Steven Kerzner, one of Trudeau’s most vocal defenders on social media appears to be dead set on proving me right.
The 52-year-old sock puppet decided to post the following tweet on Thursday, arguing that the only time Trudeau wore blackface was when he was a teenager and that by extension because he had helped people of colour, we should move on.
To all you morons who keep referring to #Trudeau as 'blackface' for something he did as a teenager, apologized for & became an adult supporting POC – shut the fuck up already. Not only were none of you perfect in high school as teens, you're assholes as adults. Bunch of schmucks.— Ed the Sock (@EdtheSock) December 6, 2019
This, of course, ignores the far more extended history of Trudeau and blackface. As many now know, Trudeau wore blackface more times than he can remember, and according to himself, only learned that it was racist when he became a member of parliament.
Within moments, users pointed out that Trudeau had done the act from the age of 15 until he was at least 29.
The Sock’s response?
Aladdin wasn’t blackface, and because there is no “North American” parallel, it didn’t count as racist intent.
When he did blackface, he was about 15. The Aladdin thing wasn't blackface, there's no parallel in Norht America between the history of blackface & 'brownface', a term very few brown ppl had ever heard of. He got carried away w/the role. Not smart but not racist intent either.— Ed the Sock (@EdtheSock) December 6, 2019
At this point, I had to step in.
1. It was jet black.

2. My skin colour is not a costume.

3. Nice of you to attempt to white wash a moment of racism. https://t.co/5VMgiX8i8K— Seyed Ali Taghva (@Ali_Taghva) December 6, 2019
Sadly, the sock doubled down arguing that brownface was simply “racially insensitive” rather than racist and Trudeau had apologized.
Of course, this reasoning was flawed as well.
Blackface is racist. Brownface is racist. Trudeau only apologized because he was caught, and the PM has stated that he viewed blackface itself as not racist until multiple years after the Aladdin incident.
He apologized because he was caught.

Brown face is also racist.

Your attempt to pretend it isn't is truly shameful. https://t.co/sRlZkSHOmA pic.twitter.com/8OhPreiFJN— Seyed Ali Taghva (@Ali_Taghva) December 6, 2019
While this instance has shown just how far many will stoop to defend the nation’s disgraced PM, it is by no means new.
Even during the election, Liberal MP Judy Sgro attempted to make light of the issue by arguing that black Canadians in her riding actually grew to love Trudeau even more because he had decided to put on blackface.
These instances should truly worry the public, as defenders of the Liberal PM repeatedly try to minimize the actual damage caused by his decisions.
For example, imagine for a moment how young people online who may be fans of the Sock or any of the other Liberal MPs who have put their foot in their mouths could be reading these defences of Trudeau.
Could those kids be potentially be led down a path of believing that brownface is ok?
Hopefully not, but what stops them from thinking “if the PM can do it, why can’t I?”
At this rate, it certainly isn’t the consequences."

The video in question has been viewed more than 19 million times since it was published.

Throughout the video, Trudeau can be heard discussing the president’s team reacting to comments made by the president, seemingly forgetting that his own team had to deal with three cases of blackface in 24 hours during the recent Canadian election.  Even that came after he and his party threw two women under the bus for standing up to the Trudeau government and demanding the rule of law be respected.
In response to the comments made by world leaders, Trump stated that Trudeau was “two-faced.”

The PM has stated that at the time he did not know to put on blackface was wrong. While the PM has claimed ignorance, according to the Toronto Star article, experts find it quite difficult to believe Trudeau’s claim that he didn’t know the act was wrong,
“It’s totally disingenuous,” says Rinaldo Walcott, director of the University of Toronto’s Women & Gender Studies Institute. “By 2001, when he would have been 29 years old, there would have been debates around these concerns.”
While the Liberals will likely ignore the two-faced nature of their leader, instead preferring to turn this fumble into an ad or campaign moment to fundraise off of some Canadians’ dislike of Trump, the truth is that this mistake does far more than harm Canada’s standings with our closest ally. Perhaps most worryingly, it displays the genuine two-faced nature of our now two-term prime minister to the entire world.
Whether it is the failed promises of electoral reform and limited deficits to a leadership style that focuses on dividing the nation or the shameful handling of the SNC-Lavalin scandal, the many other times Trudeau has broken ethics rules, or perhaps the willingness to take indigenous children to court, there is a clear pattern of two-faced actions.
While Canadians have known that Prime Minister Sunny Ways will say one thing and do another, our closest ally appears to only be awakening to that reality.
As they become fully aware, we Canadians are left to deal with the repercussions, should the United States, for example, decide to reduce trade, increase tariffs, or heck just drag their heals on potentially worthwhile deals as they lose trust in Canadian leadership.
Sadly, if the Prime Minister’s first term shows us anything about the future, this may very well be just the beginning."

Whether it was Trudeau and Freeland giving virtue-signalling speeches that were thinly-veiled swipes at the US, lecturing the US on social issues, or Trudeau’s latest debacle at the NATO summit, it’s been clear that the Trudeau Liberals have no respect for America.
Yet, at the very same time, the Trudeau Liberals show far more respect towards Communist China, no matter how badly that nation treats Canada.
Consider the fact that—whatever disagreements Trudeau and Trump may have—the US is still available to talk and discuss issues with our country, and is a democratic nation governed by the rule of law.
By contrast, Trudeau and Freeland often can’t even get China to answer their phone calls.
Canada and America are part of the same inheritance of Western Civilization, and our history and future are inextricably linked.
Meanwhile, Canada’s values and the values of China’s Communist government are clearly incompatible, as the suppression of freedom, forced organ harvesting, denial of religious rights, execution of political dissidents, and horrifying surveillance state all makes clear.
And while Canada and the US have disputes like any two nations do, the fact remains that China has treated us far worse than the US ever has. China is illegally detaining two Canadian Citizens, has spoken in arrogant and threatening tones towards our nation, and is clearly an ideological and strategic adversary.
Additionally, the vast majority of our foreign trade is with the US, and given our amazingly weak defence spending, the US is basically the only armed force that is defending North America (and by extension defending the Canadian People) at the present time.
All of this should be the basic groundwork for how any Canadian Leader thinks about the United States. And it should go without saying that a Canadian Leader should always be more respectful towards the US than towards Communist China.
But with Trudeau, we see the opposite.
He’s never laughed about Xi Jinping.
He’s never mocked Xi Jinping.
He hasn’t even lectured China on their concentration camps with as much force as he lectured the US about abortion.
In short, Trudeau has shown far more respect to Communist China than he has towards the United States, a clear sign that his value-system and worldview is severely messed up.
Trudeau appears to be in thrall to the view of the radical far-left which blames the Western world for everything, admires brutal communist states, and seeks to weaken their own nation and our Western allies in order to strengthen foreign nations out of some insane sense of “historical guilt.”
Now, with Trudeau’s screwed up mindset governing the nation, our country is increasingly distanced from our closest ally, putting all of Canada at risk in an increasingly dangerous world."
0,2019-12-05T07:45:51.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/witnessing-anti-semitic-hate-at-york-university-was-a-profound-eye-opener,Witnessing anti-Semitic hate at York University was a profound eye-opener,"The walls shook at York University on November 20.
So did the floors and the ceilings. And I’m sure many of those who witnessed the “protest” against former I.D.F. soldiers who were speaking on campus, were also shaken up.
As hundreds of demonstrators stomped through Vari Hall, banging the walls, ceilings and counters of that welcome-point for students and visitors to York, their unified screams of “Viva viva Palestina! Viva viva Intifada!”, became deafening.
What a welcome people received that night: explicit calls for the murder of Israelis from a school-approved student group through suicide bombings, shootings, stabbings and all other forms of violence the Palestinian Intifada is famous for.
Led by Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA), and joined by Torontonians usually spotted at protests against the State of Israel, demonstrators morphed into an organized mob. In the chaos of the violent exchanges between the pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian factions, I couldn’t hear anything but the buzz of my eardrums. I felt like a character in a movie trying to regain my equilibrium after a bomb had gone off—I can see my surroundings but can’t hear anything. I see the venom in people’s eyes, and the expressions of rage across their faces; I feel the ground under my feet thumping, but a disturbing silence takes over.
As a York alumnus (2006–2010), I’m used to demonstrations. My classes in Vari Hall were sometimes interrupted by the angry chants of Tamil Tiger supporters, anti-Israel activists and the annual Israel Apartheid Week. This time, however, the fear tactics and open aggression against Israel and its supporters were bigger, louder—and I’m not ashamed to say it—scarier.
In contrast to past protests, this one was morally supported, at least implicitly, by Canada’s vote against Israel at the United Nation’s only two days prior, a vote that puts Canada in the same corner vis-à-vis Israel as North Korea and other inhumane regimes which play victim to the world, while starving their own populations, and using torture and intimidation to quash free speech.
And that was exactly the protestors’ purpose: to prevent those with a different narrative from sharing their lived experiences of protecting Israel from Intifada. I had to remind myself that we weren’t in the streets of Syria, Yemen or even Hong Kong. I was in Canada, where free speech reigns, not hate speech and shameless intimidation tactics that starve inquisitive minds and stifle constructive conversation between those who disagree.
To be clear, an Intifada is meant to create chaos in Israel while convincing the world that the Palestinians are the most oppressed people on earth, otherwise, “Why would they turn to such drastic measures as suicide bombing to defend themselves?!”
Similarly, SAIA and its supporters intimidate their detractors by creating chaos; this allows their “criticism” of Israel to be expressed without the inconvenient issue of intellectual challenge. As people try to swallow the lump in their throat caused by the intimidating mob, SAIA tries to get them to swallow their version of reality by turning up the noise and creating instability by literally making the surroundings shake.
It is not only valuable but critical for our intellectual growth to have hard conversations. However, as soon as one side drowns out the other side’s voice, as soon as they bar individuals from sharing their truth, and as soon as people are too scared and frightened to even identify as a group of people who share the same values, we as a society have failed.
Canada is a place where no one, whether Jewish, Muslim, Armenian, Tutsi, Ukrainian, et al., should ever be unsafe, shouted down, pushed around or threatened with collective physical attack in the form of an Intifada, for example.
Yet, while the walls shook and the floor beneath my feet trembled last Wednesday at York University, I looked around at other Jews and realized that the “Never Again” mantra that I was raised to respect is pointless, if people do nothing to stop the kind of vitriolic hate that mob was apparently so proud of.
Never Again means nothing if we let this animosity to continue to fester like a gaping wound against freedom and responsibility. The piercing screams from last week cannot fall on deaf ears. In the face of this storm, silence is nothing but a dangerous luxury.
Returning to York last week to observe the protest, I was hoping campus officials no longer welcomed the types of fear-mongering masquerading as “free speech”, which I had witnessed years prior. Instead of being proud of my alma mater for dealing with what was already in my day a long-standing problem, I’m left with a foreboding sadness for my kids’ future, the future of that school and academies across the continent.
Until the screaming stops and the other side is willing to dialogue, I don’t know where we’re headed and when those walls will stop shaking."

Both areas have gone through extreme controversy in recent months, with the Chinese government’s extremely heavy-handed response to protestors in Hong Kong, alongside private information regarding the treatment of Muslims, including forced re-education camps in Xinjiang being broadcast worldwide.
The planned Senate motion was first reported by Maclean’s on Tuesday by Terry Glavin.
Sen. Thanh Hai Ngo and Sen. Leo Housakos plan on presenting the motion next week as parliament is set to reconvene, with it focusing on the use of the Magnitsky law to ensure sanctions are set up.
The Magnitsky Act was set up in 2017 to allow “for the taking of restrictive measures in respect of foreign nationals responsible for gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.”
Canada has used the act against officials in  Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, Myanmar and South Sudan.
While the Conservatives lack a majority in the senate, they hope that it will further pressure the Liberals to take stronger action against the Chinese government."

As Liberals nationwide celebrate their ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, pundits have been left to wonder just what Trudeau’s victory in 2019 could mean for citizens, politics and the nation as a whole.
While the long-term implications are hard to predict, one consequence certainly is not.
In a matter of four short years, the Liberals under Trudeau have gone from the promised heroes of progressive values to the gritty practitioners of Realpolitik, with no other goal in mind than winning.
No longer are they concerned with broken promises, such as electoral reform, skyrocketing deficits or lacklustre help for injured veterans on a pension. Nor are they bothered by the federal government’s continued attempts to hold money designated for Indigenous child welfare, or heck, their willingness to campaign off the climate change issue, while putting forward plans that all but fail to meet Paris requirements when it comes to carbon cuts.
This doesn’t even include the gigantic mess that is the SNC-Lavalin affair, and Trudeau’s habit of violating ethics laws and throwing powerful women in his own government under the bus on a regular basis.
Heck, after this, it seems MPs and voters are still somehow all too happy to support a PM who considered blackface only racist after being elected as a member of parliament in 2008. Photos and videos have shown that Trudeau wore blackface more than three times before 2008, with the most recent known instance occurring in 2001.
With seven years of space between the time the Prime Minister was last known to wear blackface and the time he learned blackface was wrong, it is possible that the number of times it was worn stands to be far higher than three.
For the many Liberal MPs who are having difficulty keeping up with the scope of this, It’s wrong to wear blackface in 2019, just at it was wrong in the year 2001. Typically the cancel culture mob, which so intensely has concentrated into the progressive wings of politics, would have ensured a politician with such a history would have all but failed to ascend and then dominate the heights of politics.
There’s a catch though. To successfully cancel a person, normally their own fans must turn on them. And here’s where Canadian progressives are similar to Republicans in the US. Forced to campaign with a flawed idol and the protector of their views on the international stage, the willingness to cancel these individuals evaporates, principles be damned.
Instead, the boogyman of the other side has been used to ensure dedicated voters continue to push forward, regardless of moral deficiencies.
For Justin Trudeau, and perhaps the Liberal party, that level of voter control is a life-saving relationship worth its weight in gold. For the nation, it potentially sets us up the country to be defined by the actions and moral makeup of Trudeau and his government.
Said simply, there is no getting around the fact that Canada today has a leader who takes Indigenous children and veterans to court, breaks ethics laws, can’t keep simple promises, and can’t even keep count of the number of times he performed an act he himself now considers racist.
Liberal members and parliamentarians voted for that, and unless action is taken from within the party, the country alongside the Liberal movement as a whole, will come to be maligned and defined by it."

Just look at the response to any story about SNC-Lavalin, or China’s abuse of Canadian Citizens, illegal immigration, and the weak state of our armed forces.
At every step of the way, the Conservative base is completely at odds with Canada’s political elites.
And that speaks well of the Conservative base since Canada’s political elites have been getting it wrong for decades.
Our nation was once strong and influential in the world, particularly in the aftermath of World War Two.
But since then, our military and economic influence has waned, and while the elites masked our growing weakness for a while by pretending we had diplomatic “soft power,” that myth is being shattered as it’s now impossible to hide how weak our nation truly is.
Nobody takes us seriously, nobody fears us, nobody respects us, and nobody has any real reason to listen to us.
On the big issues, the common-sense of the Conservative base—made up of hardworking Canadians who are the backbone of our country—has been 100% right.
The problem is that the Conservative Party itself—due in large part to how much power the Canadian corporate establishment holds over our political parties – has often been afraid to truly push against the establishment consensus.
Even on issues where the majority of Canadians are on their side, like immigration, pushing back on China, standing up for ourselves in the world, being more independently strong and capable, the Conservatives are tentative and ultra-careful.
For example, while the Conservatives advocated for a tougher approach on China in the last election campaign, they also pushed for more trade with China in certain economic areas and slammed the Liberals for the restrictions China imposed on our exports.
In that hypocrisy, you can see the two pressures facing the Conservatives. On the one hand, the Conservative base wants us to distance ourselves from China, reduce our reliance on them, and stand up against the communist state. But the corporate establishment wants more trade with China and is willing to sell out our values to do it, and the Conservatives were afraid of totally defying them.
SNC-Lavalin is another example. The Conservatives channelled the justified anger of their base when they slammed the deferred prosecution agreement the Trudeau Liberals tried giving to the politically-connected company, yet also refused to say whether they would rescind the deferred prosecution agreement tool if they took office.
This leaves the Conservatives in a position where the enthusiasm of their anti-establishment base is often dampened, while many Canadians who could potentially be open to the Conservatives see the party as too pro-establishment and too corporate.
The fact is that the corporate establishment is increasingly international in outlook, seeking opportunities outside of Canada, and supporting policies that often hurt working-class and middle-class Canadians.
Instead of trying to out-corporate the Liberals, the Conservatives need to realize that there is more potential growth from shifting towards a more populist, economic nationalist, anti-establishment message and platform.
Sooner or later, the Conservatives will have to decide whether they’re a pro-establishment or anti-establishment party."

While the report as a whole is worrying, it does follow a growing trend both in Canada and abroad.
For example, corporate and personal bankruptcies in Alberta have also grown, according to the CBC. Areas like Calgary, have notably been left with vacancy rates approaching 30% in downtown cores as they struggle to compete in a downturn economy while lacking critical infrastructure projects such as pipelines.

Following new legislation introduced on Monday, Ontario would create “animal protection zones” where fines would be far higher for acts such as trespassing.
According to Agriculture Minister Ernie Hardeman, the Security from Trespass and Animal Safety Act would not just hike fines for trespassing on farms, it would also make it illegal to obstruct trucks carrying livestock.
The move to provide stronger consequences was put forward after the province’s livestock producers pressed the government, voicing their dissatisfaction.
“Ontario farmers and agriculture workers deserve to be able to carry out the important work they do without fear for their safety,” Hardeman said.

Under the new legislation, fines for trespassing would be set at a maximum of $15,000 for a first offence.
Subsequent offences can reach to $25,000. The bill furthermore would increase protection for farmers when it comes to civil liability for those hurt trespassing on their property, while also allowing courts to order restitution when damage is caused as a result of an offence."

According to the Globe and Mail, Trans Mountain Corp. will begin to lay pipe near Edmonton as the delayed project finally moves towards construction.
The progress could help ease some friction between Alberta and the federal government, although this could once again be constrained should environmentalists begin another campaign to stop pipeline growth.
The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion will triple the current capacity and allow for more oil to make it to both export markets in Vancouver and refineries in the United States.
Currently, the multiple organizations believe Canada loses from 50-70 million per day as a result of lacking pipeline infrastructure.

According to a new report by Feed Ontario, formerly the Ontario Association of Food Banks, there has been a 27 percent increase in the number of individuals with employment income accessing food banks over the last three years.
This includes one in every ten Ontarians who have insufficient income to afford a basic standard of living.
The 2019 Hunger Report reveals that more than five hundred thousand individuals accessed a food bank last year, visiting more than three million times. The report furthermore found a growing trend where the number of individuals with employment income still requiring food banks has increased.
“Over the last three years, Ontario’s food banks have seen a 27 percent increase in the number of adults with employment income accessing their services,” says Carolyn Stewart, Executive Director of Feed Ontario. “This tells us that, while these individuals are working in a full or part-time position, they have not been able to secure sufficient income to afford all of their basic necessities each month, like rent, heat, hydro, or food.”
Provincially, Feed Ontario is calling on the Ford government to make significant improvements to Ontario’s social assistance programs, including increases to social assistance rates, an inclusive definition of ‘disability’ under the Ontario Disability Support Program, and the development of a portable housing benefit.
“Feed Ontario believes that its vision of ending poverty and hunger is shared by all levels of government, and that there has never been a greater need for collective action than there is today,” says Stewart. “Through improvements to Ontario’s social assistance programs and government benefits, investments in affordable housing, and the development of quality employment opportunities for Ontarians, we believe that we can reduce poverty while building a future where no one goes hungry.”"

In their first annual meeting, members voted on through informal straw polls on a series of issues aimed at getting a “fair deal” from the Trudeau government.
From the province’s potential tax collection agency to the police force, trade relationships, pension plan, and firearms watchdog, members voted in large groups to support autonomy and further pull away from Ottawa.
A panel weighing those ideas is to complete its report by March 31.
“We are not seeking a special deal. We are simply seeking a fair deal,” Premier Jason Kenney told party faithful.
While not backing the secession movement, Wexit, the move to fight for autonomy is not surprising. Polls have placed Alberta’s desire to potentially declare independence close to if not higher than the separatist-prone province of Quebec."

Despite currently being members of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) the municipal district of Bonnyville is forgoing its membership to send a message that it is tired of not being heard.
Bonnyville is heavily reliant on the oil and gas industry and thought that despite not having a pro-oil & gas federal government, the FCM would at least be able to lobby the government on behalf of the municipality’s needs.
According to a county representative, the issue is that the FCM allegedly heavily favours major eastern cities as they are able to provide the most funding to the organization.
This imbalance results in an almost totalizing focus on big-city infrastructure and a distinct lack of care for the issues of a small rural Alberta municipality.
Greg Sawchuk representative for Bonnyville said that during his municipality’s withdrawal, “I got an email saying the FCM president would like to talk to you on the phone. And so I entertained this is about two weeks ago. And we had about a half-hour conversation where I put across that we just felt as though there was no mention of natural resource development, from FCM.”
Mr. Sawchuk had explained that despite the lowly position of municipalities like Bonnyville, the FCM held emergency meetings themselves and on the Rural Municipality Association, realizing the symbolic significance of Bonnyville losing faith in the federation.
Out of this move, Bonnyville not only wishes to preserve its municipal budget by not contributing to an institution that ignores them but also hopes to bring more attention to the needs of rural Alberta towns. They are making it clear that the FCM has not appropriately been representing their voice, so the Bonnyville municipal council feels it is worth taking on that responsibility themselves.
Bonnyville will officially revoke its membership at the end of 2019."

According to state-run Korean Central News Agency (KNCA), North Korea has successfully tested a “super-large multiple-rocket launcher” which Japanese President Shinzo Abe has described as “ballistic missiles.”
The news agency also added: “The volley test-fire aimed to finally examine the combat application of the super-large multiple launch rocket system proved the military and technical superiority of the weapon system and its firm reliability.”
The missiles in question were fired by North Korea into the sea off its east coast on Thursday.
Condemning the launch, Abe said: “North Korea’s repeated launches of ballistic missiles are a serious defiance to not only our country but also the international community.”
While the United States has attempted to negotiate with North Korea in regards to its nuclear program, the nation has performed multiple tests in 2019, with one involving a submarine-based launch system."

While the government has celebrated victory in what can only be described as a disastrous campaign after it became public the Prime Minister had worn blackface more times than he could remember, the nation should be wary about the rather large number of broken promises coming back with the Trudeau Liberals.
According to the Trudeau Metre, the Liberals broke 67 promises throughout their first term, accounting for 29 percent of all promises made.
These broken promises include massive campaign planks such as electoral reform, failing to properly restore the veteran’s pension system, and the continuation of massive deficit which put a balanced budget potentially decades into the future rather than 2019.
With the minority governments in Canada rarely lasting more than two years, it will be interesting to see what the government attempts to do in order to keep both previous promises made and new ones brought forth during the campaign. The Liberals must make compromises with other parties.
With both the NDP and Greens cash-strapped but needing wins, and the Conservatives facing an inner-party revolt against the current leader, we will likely see a relative calm as parties adjust followed by a truly harsh period as weakened parties attempt to regain ground lost in 2015."

The problem? Virtually no part of the tweet by Yates was truthful.
Ngo was actually banned for stating information based on data from the Human Rights Commission in response to Chelsea Clinton. While Yates mentions a 12-hour suspension, in reality, it has continued for far longer.
This is because the suspension will only be removed once Andy removes his tweet. This means that Twitter is dictating his speech and refusing to allow Ngo to cite a statistical fact.

Since Nov. 15 demonstrations against the subsidy cut turned violent, seeing gas stations, alongside 100 banks have been burned to the ground, while the regime itself decided to cut the nation’s internet and open fire on protestors with live ammunition.

According to Amnesty International, more than 143 people have been killed by the regime so far in response to the protests.
“The rising death toll is an alarming indication of just how ruthless the treatment of unarmed protesters has been by the Iranian authorities and reveals their appalling assault on human life,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty’s research and advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa.
Iran has stated the number is far lower at roughly 12, while the exiled and controversial opposition group Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK) has according to The Telegraph, claimed that the number is far higher, as the regime is actively stealing bodies from morgues in an effort to keep the final body count reduced.
While protests and the bloody crackdown in response from the regime are by no means new, this case stands to be quite different than previous protests for its sheer scale and the willingness from protestors to call out the regime including the Ayelottalh himself.

According to the Minister, the two percent increase in wages and benefits requested by the Teachers’ Federation would cost $1.5 billion.
“Educators in Ontario are the second-highest remunerated in the country — we pay them well and we value their work,” Lecce said. “We’re offering a $750 million increase and the people of this province overwhelmingly, who I’ve spoken to, have said to me that they want us to be reasonable when it comes to compensation at one percent.”

Some failed Conservative candidates called on the leader to resign—demanding that he step aside so that another candidate could replace him, according to the CBC.
Scheer has been dealing with a cacophony of discontent from Conservatives after his election loss to Justin Trudeau, with many believing that the CPC leader lost a winnable election. Throughout the campaign, Scheer fell over tripwires and was sucked into a needless debate on social conservatism that distracted voters from core party messaging.
Conservative party grandees have been vocal in their criticism of Scheer. Peter MacKay, for instance, declared that issues like abortion and immigration “hung round [Scheer’s] neck like a stinking albatross.” MacKay went on to say that, “it was like having an open net and missing the net.”
Former Conservative leaders, Rona Ambrose and Kim Campbell, have also attacked Scheer, although Ambrose’s criticism was less abrasive than Campbells. On Twitter, Ambrose voiced her support of pride parades, saying that she “was proud to have been the first Tory leader to march in a Pride Parade.” She went on to say that “It’s time to move forward together and show ALL families we have their backs!” This has been seen as a direct rebuke of Scheer’s leadership.
Despite being under attack from Red Tories, Scheer has also begun to feel the heat from social conservatives as well. In an article by the Globe and Mail, it was reported that some social conservatives groups have called on Scheer to resign.
Scheer will be facing a leadership review in April of next year where he will have to defend his leadership during the election. Last month, high-level CPC sources told The Post Millennial that both Erin O’Toole and Peter MacKay were preparing leadership bids. MacKay vehemently denied the claim.
“I think he should resign and run again for his job. If he’s confident that the party membership backs him, that’s the way to test that,” said high-profile Conservative aide Kory Teneycke to CBC’s Power and Politics host Vassy Kapelos on Monday.
Teneyke was the former director of communications to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Doug Ford’s campaign manager during the 2018 Ontario election.
“Being asked if you want to be Andrew Scheer’s chief of staff right now is probably like asking someone if they want to be captain of the Titanic,” he said. “It’s a great honour if it’s before it hits the iceberg, but after the iceberg, it seems like less of an honour and more of a hardship post. I think the iceberg was the election.”

This marks the first time in Israel’s 70-year-history that a prime minister is under indictment.
This development threatens to end the 70-year-old prime minister’s career (which was already in a precarious position due to the failure of Netanyahu’s Likud party to create a coalition government in the Israeli parliament). The corruption charges were levelled against Netanyahu by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who told reporters that it was a “heavy-hearted decision” according to the Associated Press.
Among the charges is one in which he allegedly implemented regulation for a telecom company in exchange for favourable coverage of himself on popular Israeli news site Walla! News.
Other fraud and breach of trust charges deal with Netanyahu allegedly introducing legislation that would damage one of a newspaper’s major rivals in exchange for the paper giving friendly coverage to Netanyahu. Both the prime minister and the newspaper publisher deny the charges.
The prime minister is also facing bribery charges related to receiving approximately $300,000 U.S. from an Australian billionaire and a Hollywood producer. The gifts include jewellery cigars and champagne, which Netanyahu claims were just gifts between friends.
In response to the indictments, Netanyahu said that he would “continue to lead the country.” He claimed during a televised address that “the tainted investigation didn’t pursue the truth. It pursued me,” and “It’s a case of selective enforcement on steroids.”"

With members of Morales’ circle resigning under threat of violence and the reported kidnapping of their family, right-wing senator Jeanine Áñez declared herself president.
Áñez’s rise to power was preceded by racist acts of violence across Bolivia. Footage emerged of Indigenous Bolivians being attacked and forced out of towns. Militias gathered and burned the Indigenous Wiphala flag as policemen cut off this symbol from their uniforms. In at least two cities, security forces opened fire against unarmed native demonstrators. In Cochabamba, Indigenous coca growers wept and tossed flowers on the caskets of their dead. Doctors in Cochabamba assessed what occurred as a “massacre” by the police.
These were acts of terror. In a country where between 40 to 60 percent of the nation’s population is Indigenous, racism fuels the opposition. Morales has helped make himself a target. Although it is tempting to focus on his economic policies (the nationalization of hydrocarbon, for instance, helped lift one-fourth of the country’s population out of poverty), Morales’ legal reforms also brought increased autonomy to Indigenous communities. As Adriana Guzmán, a prominent activist and Aymara leader, remarked in response to the coup, “they [the opposition] have judged the [Morales] government not just because of its political mistakes. They have judged it for being Indigenous.”
Áñez symbolized the right-wing countercurrent brought into motion in Bolivia. As she declared herself president to the public, she held up and shook a large bible in her hands. This echoed Áñez’s ally, far-right Luis Fernando Camacho’s statements earlier that week as he lay a bible on the national flag in the presidential palace. It was declared that with the Indigenous president gone, “Pachamama [the Indigenous Earth Goddess] will never return. Today, Christ is returning to the Government Palace.” Áñez then moved to appoint an “Indigenous-free” cabinet. A presidential decree guaranteed impunity to the military for whatever violence they execute against protestors who might be angered at these offenses.
Of interest to Canadians and Americans is not only the racist and violent sentiment mobilized in Bolivia, but the process that brought Áñez to power. President Evo Morales was asked to step down by the military after demonstrators, militias and police forces responded to reports of election fraud. These reports largely arose from an Organization of American States’ (OAS) mission sent to monitor the elections.
The Buried Report
OAS findings were widely disseminated in South and North American media. The CBC describes the report as having found that the Bolivian “electoral tribunal inexplicably went dark for 23 hours.” When the vote count came back on, Morales had a greater lead over his opponent than before.
In way of a proper description of the election, Kevin Young, author and researcher at the University of Amherst observes: “The preliminary audit of the [OAS]… does contain allegations of widespread irregularities. On the other hand, we have the authoritative report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research [CEPR]…[which] found that there was no evidence of fraud.”
The CEPR report, authored and reviewed by a handful of researchers, notes an important nuance in Bolivian elections. There are, indeed, two counts in Bolivia. The unofficial vote count—also called a quick count—and the official vote count (or the cómputo).
Crucially, it was during the unofficial count that there was a 23-hour interruption.
In line with a trend of ending the quick vote count early, election officials suspended the count at 83.85 percent of tally sheets verified (a higher number of votes than they had promised to quick count a week before the election). The “blackout” occurred after the OAS “urged” that the count be continued. 23 hours after ending the quick vote count it was resumed after pressure from the OAS. Despite the concession to OAS demands, the OAS then attacked the resumption—with public outcry clinging to their words.
The official final results closely mirrored the results of the resumed quick count. Of course, the authors of the CEPR report note, “the legally binding official vote count did not stop for any significant period of time.” Morales’ win with 47 percent of the populations’ support, largely echoed polling prior to the election. Five out of six polls predicted Morales would win by the significant margin that he did.
The ease with which the narrative of a fraudulent election was propagated, and the swift rise of right-wing forces in Bolivia, owe much to U.S. and Canadian foreign policy.
“Democracy Promotion”
On the U.S. front, attempts to oust Morales from office are nothing new. Over the past few days, actors like opposition-leader Carlos Mesa, the OAS, and high-ranking military, have all been criticized for their relationship to U.S. funding and planning. U.S. intelligence operations, like “Operation Naked King” sought to undermine Morales through campaigns of bribery and destruction. Neil Burron observes in his study of U.S.-Bolivian relations, that the U.S. spent over $100 million between 2001 and 2009 in “democracy promotion” in Bolivia. These U.S. programs continue and are aimed at “undermin[ing] the rise of Evo Morales’s Movement toward Socialism” by financing “‘hard tactics’” namely, “support for right wing departments” in the country’s West. Morales’ mobilization of neglected and abused Indigenous communities was too great a threat to “U.S. [coca] eradication policies” and “the exploitative practices of its transnational corporations.”
More recently, leaked audio recordings reveal coordination between Bolivian police, military, and opposition leaders in planning the removal of Morales. They claimed support from U.S. senators Ted Cruz, Bob Menéndez, and Marco Rubio. Crediting his unique influence in the Trump administration, Senator Rubio is recognized by the New York Times as the “virtual secretary of state for Latin America.”
True to his distinguished role, Senator Rubio tweeted before the OAS released any commentary on the election and even prior to the end of any vote count that “all credible indications are Evo Morales failed to secure necessary margin to avoid second round in Presidential election. However some concern he will tamper with the results or process to avoid this [sic].”
In #Bolivia all credible indications are Evo Morales failed to secure necessary margin to avoid second round in Presidential election. However some concern he will tamper with the results or process to avoid this. Both @OAS_official & @EU_Commission have observers in the country.— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 21, 2019
The senator continued to formally condemn the Bolivian election as the OAS issued its report, helping to gather and legitimize support against the results. He was followed by several communiqués from the Trump administration who later congratulated the coup against Morales. In an official public statement, Washington called “the resignation” of Morales “a significant moment for democracy.” They “applaud[ed]” the initiative of “the Bolivian military” and hoped it would send a “strong signal” to other governments in the region.
Turning the Tide
Canada’s role in the Bolivian election follows a similar trajectory. The modest political pressure we’ve applied to the situation has been cheered on and ushered by the CBC. Their leading journalist on the matter, Evan Dyer, has penned articles at every point and juncture of the conflict. Dyer’s pieces’ like “Canada not ready to condemn Bolivia’s dubious election,” play to fears of the “major human rights abuses” committed by Bolivia’s “socialist” allies. He implies throughout that it is our responsibility to “join the European Union, the United States” and several of its “most important partners in the Lima Group in refusing to recognize” the “official election results.”
Responding in turn, Global Affairs Canada issued a statement condemning the election. It cites the OAS report and its findings on an electoral process that “did not comply with international standards” and its concerns over an “unexplained 24-hour interruption.” The statement concludes that “it is not possible to accept the outcome under these circumstances.” One can hardly imagine a South American state refusing to “accept” the elections of Canada and the U.S. (both of whose leaders suffer a much lower popularity than Morales’), but that is only because of our unique role as self-appointed bastions of truth and democracy. Dyer chirps in, applauding our “cautious stance.”
Canada’s political backing for the coup continued as it moved to cautiously “support” the new opposition government even as it took on unprecedented power. We’ve perhaps been more resolute, as foreign policy analyst Yves Engler notes, in our support of right-wing presidents in other countries. Chilean President Sebastian Piñera who enjoys a 14 percent approval rating received a reassuring phone call from Trudeau earlier this month. Although he made no mention of the “ongoing turmoil in Chile” transcripts show the Prime Minister criticizing “election irregularities in Bolivia” and supporting efforts for regime-change in Venezuela.
It is exactly Canada’s support for and strengthening of right-wing forces in Latin America that created an atmosphere for power to be easily stripped away from the Morales government. Far from a coalition of successful pink tide presidents with real power to control the fate of the region, Canada has ensured that the tide turn to the right. Take Canada’s leading role in the 2009 coup in Honduras. Tyler Shipley, an expert on the matter, makes clear that despite “brutal and systematic repression” as well as “assassinations” aimed at “peaceful popular resistance”, Canada quickly approved the new right-wing president and sent its foreign minister to the nation. With amazing haste, Harper later went to sign a trade agreement, aware that the new “far-right military government would be an ideal partner” for Canada’s destructive and exploitative mining interests in the country.
More recently, Canada was a major player in sowing further instability in Venezuela. Politician Juan Guaidó enjoyed near anonymity until he declared himself president with immediate U.S. and Canadian support. Trudeau mobilized the Lima group and based his legitimization of Guaidó on misquotations of the Venezuelan constitution and misinformation surrounding the legitimacy of the election of president Nicolás Maduro. The CBC failed to debunk false statements coming from the Canadian government. It was left to a letter penned by 70 scholars and experts to point out (correctly, as we now know) that “[n]either side in Venezuela can simply vanquish the other” and greater intervention can only lead to “unnecessary human suffering, violence, and instability.” Yet, these risks to human life may have been worth it in a fight against a government that “nationaliz[ed] its gold mining sector”—an affront to powerful Canadian mining companies.
Fuel to the Fire
Canada and the U.S. have succeeded in spreading a message across Latin America: elections are optional for would-be presidents. Spreading this message is what they mean by “democracy promotion.” Áñez takes after her right-wing colleagues in the region, symbolizing an entrenched white elite with a corporate friendly platform. Meanwhile, the colourful Indigenous Wiphala flag burns.

As popular—often Indigenous—resistance forms, it will be met with repression. Although the bullets will be fired by the Bolivian military and militia, the responsibility for the bloodshed will very much be shared with the U.S. and Canada."

Public schools in British Columbia are not complying with court rulings, because children are required to participate in religious rituals and spiritual practices in the classroom.
For most of Canada’s history, children in public schools have recited the Lord’s Prayer, while children in Catholic schools recited the Our Father, the same prayer. The “public” schools were, in fact, Protestant schools, inculcating the general principles of non-Catholic Christianity. In recent decades, following trends in Canadian culture, public schools have gradually ceased to be Christian.
Starting in the 1980s, a number of Jews, atheists and others launched successful court challenges to the practice of requiring children in public schools (formerly Protestant schools) to say the Lord’s Prayer. Courts accepted the argument that public schools should be neutral in regard to religion, and should not teach any one faith or creed. Requiring children to recite the Lord’s Prayer in public schools is government imposition of Christianity, and this imposition violates the Charter. The courts also ruled that exempting the children of atheists, Jews and other non-Christians from saying the Lord’s Prayer was not an adequate compromise: no child should be required to announce or declare his or her non-belief in Christianity. The courts reasoned that for a child to make use of the exemption would effectively force that child to express his or her unwillingness to say the Lord’s Prayer. This could result in unacceptable stigma or ostracism; a person has the right not to disclose his or her religious belief or non-belief to other people.
In spite of clear court rulings, John Howitt Elementary School (JHES) in Port Alberni, B.C., forces children to participate in aboriginal smudging ceremonies, in which the smoke of burning sage is waived over children to “cleanse” their “spirits” of “negative energy”. As JHES explained in a note to parents in September of 2015: without this cleansing ritual the classroom and even the furniture would harbour negative “energy” and would not be safe until the “energy” was “released”. The letter stated that each student would participate in the cleansing ritual by holding onto a cedar branch while having “smoke from Sage fanned over [their] body and spirit.”
This “Traditional Classroom/Student Cleansing” was performed by a member of the Nuu-chah-nulth, the term used to describe fifteen related First Nation tribes who live on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island. The school’s letter to parents also described Nuu-chah-nulth religious and
spiritual beliefs: “everything has a spirit” and “everything is one, all is connected”.
Concerned about the explicitly supernatural and religious nature of the cleansing ritual, and how it conflicted with her own family’s religious beliefs, Candice Servatius immediately went to the school to learn more, after receiving the JHES letter in September of 2015. But when this Port Alberni mother arrived at the school, she was shocked to find out that the ritual had already been imposed on her nine-year-old daughter.
The daughter explained that she had been coerced or pressured by the teacher to participate in the ritual against her will. When the nine-year-old girl told her teacher that she did not want to participate, the teacher told the girl that it would be “rude” not to participate in the ritual and that “all” the students were “required” to participate.
In January of 2016, Mrs. Servatius learned that a prayer based on First Nations spirituality had been performed at a JHES student assembly, with explicit references to an unspecified “god”.
JHES did not notify parents.
Mrs. Servatius’ daughter has recounted her experience in the classroom to her mother, and has also sworn an Affidavit, filed with the court action against School District 70 (Port Alberni).
School District 70 claims that the ceremonies and prayers that children are required to participate in are merely “cultural” and therefore not religious or spiritual. This assertion is contradicted by what the School District itself told parents in the letter in September of 2015.
School District 70 has offered to exempt children from these rituals, when a parent or child requests such exemption. But courts have explained why exemptions from spiritual or religious practices are not an acceptable solution: no child should have to face stigma or ostracism by needing to signal her disagreement with an aboriginal cleansing ritual. Further, consistent with clear court rulings, section 76 of the B.C. School Act requires public schools to be conducted on “strictly secular and non-sectarian principles”.
Witnesses for the Attorney General of B.C. and the Nuu-chul-nuth Tribal Council, both of whom are intervening in the case, have already stated that it is contrary to First Nations practice to compel anyone to be smudged against their will, and that it is “unnecessary” to hold smudging
ceremonies in classrooms in order to teach about First Nations culture.
The Charter exists to protect the right of Canadians to live and participate in public life in accordance with their own conscience and beliefs. This includes the right to live free from government-imposed religion.
The state should not enforce or impose any sectarian creed or ideology on children, by requiring children to say a prayer or participate in a religious or spiritual ceremony. It’s one thing to teach children about Islam, but quite another to require children to kneel on prayer rugs and recite Islamic prayers while facing in the direction of Mecca. Public schools can teach children about Christianity’s central prayer, but cannot ask children to recite that prayer.
Likewise, it’s possible to teach children about aboriginal spiritual rituals without requiring children to participate in them.
The Supreme Court of B.C. will hear this case in Nanaimo from Nov. 18 to 22, 2019."
0,2019-11-15T08:10:14.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/liberals-and-conservatives-are-fundamentally-the-same,Liberals and Conservatives are fundamentally the same,"In the recent elections, Trudeau’s Liberals and Scheer’s Conservatives aggressively clashed in an effort to win over Canadian voters.
They got about a third of the popular vote each, with the Liberals forming a minority government. Conservatives went into an uproar, some calling for the removal of Scheer as party leader and others calling for the separation of western Canada into its own sovereignty.
Despite this perceived clash of parties who apparently represent two sides of a political spectrum, when you look at the actual politics of the two parties, there is much more in common than there is difference.
The difference is in rhetoric, not in substance.
Under the hood, the Liberals and the Conservatives are fundamentally the same. Where they differ is in the values they performatively signal to voters–Liberals portray themselves as social justice progressives while Conservatives prefer to espouse more traditional values.
Unfortunately for voters and for our democracy, these differences are merely surface level. When Canadians vote, they are mostly voting against something rather than for something. They tend not to vote for policies but rather against Trudeau or against Scheer. In this way, politics gets reduced to a spectacle worthy only of reality television, not of civil discourse.
On actual important political issues, the two parties are essentially the same–they both serve the rich and the corporate class while throwing bones to the rest of us.
Let’s take a look at the policies. I’ll start with what is perceived to be one of the big differences between the two parties–the carbon tax. Both parties agree that climate change is an issue, but the Liberals are in favour of a carbon tax while the Conservatives are not.
But what do the Conservatives want instead? Their recent platform promises investments in companies pursuing green technologies and it calls for new environmental standards, with fines for businesses that don’t meet them.
So, essentially, Conservatives want to use public money to subsidize private industries that they deem “green” and they want to fine businesses that are not “green.” This subsidization of government-approved businesses opens the door to corruption and backroom deals, while the fines only serve to hurt small businesses who can’t afford them rather than going after heavy polluters, who will be more than happy to pay the paltry fines.
The Conservatives have criticized the Liberals for their corporate welfare, but their “green” subsidization plans call for more of the same.
And this is not to defend the Liberal’s carbon tax, which is also a poor policy. The carbon tax will mostly affect poorer folks and small businesses who can’t afford additional expenses. The big businesses that do most of the polluting can easily afford to pay the tax and benefit from their smaller competitors going out of business.
Both parties’ policies strengthen big business while hurting small businesses and doing little for the average Canadian. While Conservatives want to repeal the carbon tax, their environmental fines would work in much the same way.
Staying on the topic of climate, both parties have committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and both acknowledge that climate change is a reality. They both want to use public money to subsidize private industries pursuing clean energy. And, most strikingly of all, they are both champions of the Trans Mountain Pipeline, although the Conservatives wave their flag a little higher. On environmental issues, the choice between the Liberals and the Conservatives can be decided with a coin flip.
When it comes to the deficit, the Liberals have shifted their goal to balance the budget from 2019 to 2040. The Conservatives vowed to erase the deficit by cutting $1.5 billion in “corporate welfare” and by selling federally owned buildings. However, judging by their pledge to give handouts to clean energy companies, it is unclear if the cuts to corporate welfare would be actual cuts or more of a redirection to other private industries. It is also important to note that, historically, the Conservatives have contributed to debt rather than alleviating it.
As for the Conservative’s plan to sell federally owned buildings to private owners, this is a potentially disastrous act of privatization that seeks a short-term gain in exchange for long-term prosperity. Real estate is a great asset to have and selling it off for what are likely to be garage sale prices to private hands could prove extremely costly in the long run. Not to mention the huge risk of corruption involved in privatization.
And sure, Trudeau’s deficit spending has gotten out of control, but redirecting corporate handouts, cutting public services, and selling federally owned real estate to private companies is not the answer. And judging by the Conservative’s history of debt accumulation, it is hard to believe that they would reverse the trend on the deficit.
On other issues like childcare, education, Indigenous rights, and housing, neither party really distinguishes itself from the other. Both parties are severely lacking on Indigenous issues, both support the Canada Child Benefit–which does little to alleviate the soaring costs of childcare in big cities, neither party offers any solutions to student debt, and both parties offer meagre home buyer benefits while doing nothing to help renters.
On healthcare, Liberals plan to take “next steps” towards pharmacare while effectively doing nothing to pursue those next steps. The Conservatives are a little more honest and dismiss pharmacare entirely. Both parties want to increase spending on mental health through health transfer payments, a meagre solution for a growing problem. Again, more of the same from the allegedly vastly different parties.
With regards to immigration, both parties want to increase the number of immigrants to 350,000 by 2021, with most of those being economic immigrants, and both want to crack down on “asylum shopping” and illegal border crossings. If immigration is your issue, Scheer and Trudeau are interchangeable.
Another big issue for a lot of Conservative voters is taxes. Both parties promise to lower taxes for the middle class, but they do this within Trojan horse policies that overwhelmingly benefit the rich. The Liberals are reducing taxes through an extension of the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) exemption while the Conservatives propose a universal tax cut. Let’s look at the numbers:
For those of us making less than six figures annually, the Liberal plan provides a slight advantage in savings. But for those lucky few making more, both parties plan to fill your pockets, with the Conservatives being a little more generous towards the rich. It’s no wonder that wealthy donors often choose to max out donations to both parties.
Andrew Scheer and Justin Trudeau lead parties that serve the interests of the rich and of Canada’s corporate oligarchy. While they paint themselves as different–Trudeau, in the past, opting to literally paint himself–they are depressingly similar. Both are dishonest in their messaging and try to win over average Canadians while pushing policies that overwhelmingly benefit the rich and powerful. But since Trudeau is actually running the country, he deserves more criticism.
Trudeau is a perfect con artist, depicting himself as a progressive champion of the people in speeches and then turning around and going back on his word behind closed doors. This was never more perfectly displayed than in the climate march where Trudeau took to the streets to march against the actions of his own government.
Trudeau has turned his back on our Indigenous population, he turned his back on electoral reform, and he expanded the oil and gas sector after running on a promise to transition to clean energy. From 2015-19, he could’ve easily upheld his promises with a majority government and NDP support for his progressive proposals. He chose not to.
Instead, he did mass infrastructure privatization, he weakened Canada’s access-to-information system and muzzled journalists and scientists in the process, he sold arms to Saudi Arabia who then used them to commit genocide in Yemen, and he signed the CETA, giving foreign companies the right to sue our government for introducing laws that might cut into their future profits.
Trudeau positions himself as the “woke” candidate, but the fact of the matter is if you’re running the government for the benefit of the rich, Canadians could care less if you have a diverse cabinet. When it comes to corruption, it doesn’t matter if it’s being done by an ethnically diverse and gender-balanced cabinet or a cabinet full of white men–the results are the same.
However, as I’ve laid out here, Scheer and the Conservatives are no better for the average Canadian. When political campaigns are run on empty rhetoric, performative wokeness, divisive attacks, and fear-mongering, voters don’t get to engage with actual policy proposals and the end up voting emotionally rather than logically.
When we vote against a character like Trudeau or Scheer instead of voting for popular policy proposals being pushed by other parties, we end up going back and forth between two parties who both serve the interests of the elite and the ruling class.
It’s time to dump our two-party system, which is, in reality, a one-party oligarchy."

There are many contributing factors, but a common two-ply thread is the demonization of the state of Israel as an all-evil oppressor and the Palestinians as an all-innocent oppressed people. The obsession rises to its crescendo on university campuses, where fulltime hate-fuelled activists plow their Israel-delegitimization furrow without surcease via the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS).
BDS has failed to achieve many of its stated goals, such as forcing universities to divest financially from Israel or boycotting scholars from Israel (they have no power to do either in any case, no matter how many resolutions they pass). But they have made great headway in their unstated goal, which is to normalize the concept of Israel as a moral pariah state, and to create a climate of fear amongst Jewish students who are justly proud of their homeland’s democratic character and high achievements, but are too intimidated, thanks to relentless BDS pressure—psychologically and even literally in many cases—to express their pride.
For many years, extreme anti-Zionists indignantly denied that their hatred for Israel was a form of anti-Semitism. People of good faith struggled to believe this was true. But there has been too much ugliness in the BDS to keep that flimsy veil in place. Even Justin Trudeau, usually better known as a fence-straddler than an outright Israel supporter, has been forthright in his denunciation as BDS.
University administrators are rightly alarmed by the creeping pall of BDS menace that shadows their campuses, and, encouraged by the Canadian government’s signing-on to the Working Definition of Anti-Semitism created by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IRHA) in 2015, they have adopted it for their own purposes. Amongst the examples the IRHA definition offers as an expression of hatred toward Jews are these: “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor;” and “Applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.”
At McGill University, the principal vehicle for disseminating Israel hatred is the McGill Daily, which is frequently guilty of the forms of anti-Semitism described above. The Daily has always been inclined to far-left ideology, and extreme anti-Zionism has been an integral component of the far left for many decades. The Daily, which is funded by student fees, receiving $300,000 annually, makes no secret of its bias, rather takes pride in it, constantly publishing diatribes against Israel, but refusing to accept pro-Israel counterpoint articles.
Last week the Canadian Jewish News reported that at the beginning of the academic year, the Daily announced its definition of Zionism as “represent[ing] a racist attitude and violent practice against Palestinians” that “only recognizes Israeli/Jewish hegemony and legitimacy to self-determination in Palestine.” A link to a BDS site was provided to readers.
Two McGill law students, Michael Aareau and Josh Shapiro, submitted a rebuttal, in it contending the Daily definition was “not only factually inaccurate, but malicious as well,” and further stating that “Zionism is the national movement of the Jewish people to express their right to self-determination,” which the Daily turned away. The letter-writers appealed to university administrators, arguing the discrimination was a violation of the Daily’s letters policy.
Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau supported their claim and intervened, threatening, if they did not, arbitration that could have resulted in the de-funding of the Daily. The Daily caved, resulting in the rebuttal letter being published (in deliberately small font) in their Nov 4 issue, but accompanied by an editorial apologizing for its appearance and protesting “administrative interference.” In it, the Daily thanked Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) and Independent Jewish Voices McGill (IJV) for help in composing their vicious response to the rebuttal, which included accusations of ethnic cleansing on Israel’s part and “violent occupation.”
Both SPHR and IJV are hard-core pillars of the BDS movement, which is in essence exterminationist: that is, BDS has for its goal not a two-state solution, but a one-state solution, a Palestinian state in which Jews would become a minority and might or might not have rights or even security. Neither group admits any inherent Jewish claims whatsoever on their ancestral land, in itself a form of anti-Semitism.
Several community groups have issued a call to action by the university. Media watch group, Honest Reporting Canada, has asked McGill’s administration to conduct a formal investigation into the Daily and to take action to “ensure it ceases its anti-Israel animus and avowed discriminatory practices.” Hasbara Fellowship Canada commended the Deputy Provost for his treatment of the affair, and CIJA (Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs) condemned the Daily, pledging continued support for affected students. Rabbi Reuben Poupko, CIJA co-chair, stated, “It is painfully ironic that those who claim to advocate for diversity have been exposed as censors of opinions with which they disagree.”
Anti-Zionism/anti-Semitism has been given wide latitude on campus on grounds of freedom of speech, but also because Jews are perceived as “privileged” and therefore ineligible for claims to victimhood under any circumstances. As a result, Jews are assaulted by constant messages of Israel hatred, from which there is no escape: in their public spaces, such as the Daily’s constant barrage of accusations, and in their private spaces, as in the toxically anti-Israel social media they are exposed to, and in their classrooms, where anti-Zionism is shamelessly bruited by many far-left academics.
Jews are not a monolithic group by any means. But they share one common experience. Most Jews attend a university and at an age when they are absorbing the ideas that will guide their attitudes and even their life trajectories. Increasingly, young Jews are being subjected to a form of involuntary indoctrination, including hate speech, regarding an existential tenet of their religion and sense of peoplehood. All too many of them are emerging with a feeling of shame in being associated with a state they have been taught – or rather taken in by osmosis – is the “Jew amongst the nations.”
There is a cancer on our campuses and the Daily is one big reason why it is metastasizing. This is common knowledge. Hand-wringing over the problem has gone on for too long. The time for action, including defunding of the Daily or the establishment of a rival newspaper that receives equal funding, has come."

The union representing school teachers across Ontario elementary schools are ready to begin work to rule job action as early as November 26th.
Work to rule action involves following the exact wording of contracts, which in many cases exclude vast tasks required to keep a school functioning.
The Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario represents 83,000 elementary public school teachers, occasional teachers and education professionals across the province.
Ninety-eight percent of union members voted for work to rule.
“Our goal is to turn up the heat on Premier Ford and his education minister, Stephen Lecce,” said Sam Hammond, ETFO president, in a news release.
“It’s critical that they finally come to contract talks prepared to address the real issues of concern: more supports for students with special needs, the protection of Ontario’s Kindergarten program and critical issues like addressing violence in schools.”"

According to a recent report by Bloomberg News, the Spanish oil company Repsol is considering purchasing as much as half-a-million barrels of heavy crude a month from the western province, and in turn, transporting it to Europe through rail and shipping through Montreal’s ports.
The company is currently considering multiple locations including New Jersey, as it struggles to make up the production lost in Venezuela and Mexico.
If a deal is made, it could be seen as a boon to the Kenney government in Alberta, as European deals involving Canadian oil are rare. For example, only 400,000 barrels of Alberta oil was sent in the last year to the U.K, one of Canada’s largest European trading partners.
The shipment could also revive moral in the overall industry which has recently seen former giants such as Encana move south, where the regulatory environment, as well as access to capital,  is seen as more favourable."
0,2019-11-11T08:46:41.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/male-title-ix-activist-expelled-after-feminist-witch-hunt,Male Title IX activist expelled after “feminist witch-hunt”,"A prolific Title IX activist and former Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California (USC) alleges that his school retaliated against him for his activism and that they “did all they could to sabotage” his chance of earning a Ph.D.
Now, he’s fighting back.
Kursat Pekgoz, 31, was relatively unknown until about two years ago. He studied Molecular Biology and English in Turkey and worked as a translator for some time. Five years ago he applied to USC in hopes of earning a Ph.D. in English.
By all accounts, Pekgoz was a standout candidate.
USC was smitten. Though Pekgoz received offers of admission from Tufts University and Rice University, USC wooed him away with an offer of the highly coveted Provost’s Fellowship, which covered his tuition and gave him a living stipend.
“Everything seemed fine during my first few years,” Pekgoz told TPM from his apartment in Los Angeles earlier this year. He conducted research, presented at conferences, and even taught one class a semester for three years.
But by 2017, Pekgoz noticed that his fellow male students had fewer scholarship opportunities than women. He wasn’t concerned for himself— Pekgoz received a full scholarship from USC—but for other male students.
“The injustice is obvious,” he told me.
To try to fix this, Pekgoz filed a federal complaint against USC in 2017, arguing that USC’s “women only” programs violate Title IX, a federal law that threatens to penalize schools if they fail to treat men and women fairly.
Women are the majority of undergraduate students, graduate students, and academic employees today. Despite this imbalance, many colleges offer massive scholarship opportunities and exclusive programs to promote their success.
The complaint was unprecedented. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) agreed the concerns might be legitimate, as I reported last January.
Noting his success, Pekgoz filed complaints against other colleges. Some nonprofits and attorneys followed his approach; 15 other colleges are now under federal review, according to exclusive documents provided to The Post Millennial.
Pekgoz’s unorthodox strategy catapulted him into the spotlight; both on campus and nationally. Outlets including NBC News, The Daily Wire, Refinery 29, The Chronicle of Higher Education, FOX News, USA TODAY, covered his activism efforts.
As fame graced Pekgoz, USC soon caught wind of his activism efforts. It is impossible to pinpoint exactly when his professors, dissertation committee, and fellow students started to catch on to Pekgoz’s activism.
But it caused him trouble, fast.
“I was on friendly terms with professors before they began shunning me for my stance on gender politics,” said Pekgoz. Two professors—Hilary Schor and Margaret Russett—“sabotaged my dissertation,” Pekgoz claimed.
“Hilary Schor vetoed my dissertation in secret right after she discovered about my Title IX activism, even though she gave me an A and praised my writing before.”
“Margaret Russett, a feminist professor who went to Yale, terminated my Ph.D. student status even though it was her pressure which led me to turn down offers of admission from Tufts and Rice” he added.
Neither professor responded to a request for comment.
In February 2019, Professor Emily Anderson emailed Pekgoz recommending “continuous enrollment for year 6” and noted that “that [USC] can absolutely provide a tuition/health award” if Pekgoz wanted to stay in the Ph.D. program.
But just one day before his sixth year, his dissertation committee changed course.
“I am writing in my role as Director of Graduate Studies to inform you that you will be dismissed from the Ph.D. program in English Language and Literature and the University of Southern California, effective immediately,” wrote Anderson on August 28.
She claimed Pekgoz failed to make “satisfactory progress” towards his Ph.D.
However, Pekgoz disputes the assessment and is fighting to get back to USC.
In an appeal letter submitted on September 27, Pekgoz claims USC officials singled him out, refused to grant his leave of absence request, and gave him an “arbitrary deadline” to submit his first thesis chapter which he claims no other student was subject to.
He also argued that there was “no formal precedent” for the deadline and that the stipulation that the thesis chapter be “viable” was “too vague and arbitrary.” Further, other students routinely take up to eight or nine years to finish their Ph.D., he wrote.
Pekgoz submitted an appeal on September 27. The process is ongoing.
“They were willing to honour me with distinctions before I started my advocacy, but they singled me out for persecution after my advocacy became public,” said Pekgoz. “This has a chilling effect on academic freedom and political discourse.”
“There’s no doubt my expulsion was politically motivated,” he added.
Thankfully, Pekgoz is currently employed. While he says he loves his work, he still hopes to return to USC and finish his Ph.D. Whether that will happen remains to be seen. USC offers three stages of appeal for dismissed graduate students.
The first stage, which involves a meeting with the Chair of the English Department, was denied. The second stage—which involves an appeal letter to Dean Finkle—was scheduled for November 4, but Pekgoz hasn’t heard back.
The last stage involves a formal hearing with Provost Sally Pratt. There is no date set for this hearing as of right now. “There is no date scheduled for this phase as of today. Still, [the situation] involves University employees, so I am going through the motions before taking it to Court.”

0,2019-11-11T06:50:12.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/canadas-democracy-needs-more-clash,Canada’s democracy needs more clash,"Disclosure: Garnett Genuis is the Conservative MP representing Sherwood Park–Fort Saskatchewan in Alberta.
One of the most important and formative experiences for me on the road to getting into politics was competitive debate—in both high school and university. I would strongly recommend this activity as optimal preparation for anyone considering the same path.
Competitive debaters compete to defend a point of view. They very often will defend a point of view that is not their own.
Every competitive debater is taught early that an essential characteristic of good debate is something called “clash”. Clash is when arguments are made to directly counter the arguments made by the other side—to show that, even on their own terms, the other side’s arguments fail. The alternative to a good debate characterized by clash is a bad debate which resembles two ships passing in the night—essentially, debaters doing their own monologue without much reference to what others are saying.
Debate in the Canadian Parliament has come to be characterized by the near complete absence of meaningful clash. MPs deliver prepared speeches one after the other that cast arguments on their own terms and play to their own social media following. It is extremely rare that an MP would use his or her speech to deconstruct the arguments of a previous speaker.
Clash is essential in good political conversations, though, because a neutral listener has a hard time weighing out who is right and who is wrong if meaningful refutation and deconstruction of arguments does not take place. If we are to be what Edmund Burke thought Parliament should be—the “deliberative assembly of one nation”, then we must talk to one another and about one another’s arguments.
In the same speech, Burke told voters in 1774: “Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests; which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates; but parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole; where, not local purposes, not local prejudices, ought to guide, but the general good, resulting from the general reason of the whole. You choose a member indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not member of Bristol, but he is a member of parliament.”
It is very important for all members of the newly constituted 43rd parliament to reflect on the importance of clash and on Burke’s advice. If we are going to work together, then we must first be able to talk together, and disagree substantively, while seeking to persuade each other to change our perspectives. People who cannot argue together well will generally struggle to work together well. We must also denominate our conversations in terms of the common good, not the narrow particular interests of one group over another.
There are a few reasons why this will be particularly difficult in the 43rd parliament. The third largest political party exists explicitly to advance the interests of one region of the country over the interests of the rest of the country. The Bloc cannot be expected to seek to advance the national interest of a nation that they seek to break apart. Though less explicitly, the governing party has and will likely continue to pursue a strategy of ignoring the development needs of western Canada. When parties run regional instead of national campaigns, they are talking past some parts of the country they think they can ignore, and only talking to parts of the country that they think they need.
It has always been interesting to me that Justin Trudeau briefly did competitive debating as a student as well. However, he stopped competing early on, noting: “I discovered I had a serious limitation for either a debater or a lawyer. I wasn’t able to argue for something I didn’t passionately believe in.” Unfortunately, an inability to dig into, understand and defend views that are not yours is not just a limitation for a debater or a lawyer—it is also a limitation for a parliamentarian and for a leader. In the privacy of one’s own mind or as an intellectual exercise, one should be able to defend things that one does not believe in order to understand and argue against those same things later. A nation as diverse as Canada particularly needs leaders who are capable of understanding and responding to different modes of thought than their own.
I hope that we will be able to raise the quality of clash in upcoming parliamentary debates, but I worry that there are a variety of cultural factors, as well as institutional ones, that are working against us. We live in an age of social media filtering, where people easily get only the information that confirms their pre-existing biases. But more broadly, our culture has for a long time lacked a common understanding of what constitutes the common good—and so we generally treat political opinions as if they were expressions of individual emotive preferences as opposed to substantive deductions about facts. There are no short-term solutions to these problems but treating opinions as opinions instead of as feelings would be a good start.
For Conservatives, we can take some pride in the fact that our support grew across the country, and that we tried to speak in terms of national ideals and projects. Inevitably those ideals and projects were more popular in some places than in others. In this new Parliament, Conservatives must maintain a truly national orientation. I will defend the interests of my own riding, but I will seek to do so in terms that are persuasive to people in other regions and in other parties. Pursuing an idea of separatism in the west, which will never come to fruition, is not a good way to be persuasive to people in other regions. It is especially dangerous in an environment where our primary complaint is the land-locking of our resources.
I am not particularly optimistic about the amount of meaningful clash that will be on display in the next Parliament, but I hope to be pleasantly surprised."

According to the City of Toronto’s daily tracker, the city’s homeless shelters remain at 99 or even 100% capacity for certain demographics.
City of Toronto
Space for single men maintained an occupancy rate of 98%, while women hit 99%. Family shelters, excluding motels, reached capacity, with 100% occupancy.
While this data is worrying, a video posted to Twitter, which has since gone viral, shows the problem with clarity.
Simply said, on extreme nights, with such high occupancy rates, those in need could see themselves turned away.
Light snow and there are absolutely no beds, respite spaces, or out of cold spots in Toronto tonight. I was denied even staying inside Peter Street at 12:20, 12:45, and 1:45 (all recorded).

While the occupancy situation remains problematic and potentially excludes many, it also creates a scenario of scarcity where resources given to those who make it in are also reduced.
In October, the City found itself in hot water, when a Toronto street nurse called the city “second class” after releasing undercover footage filmed showing the state of shelters.
The footage reveals rows of cots on the ground, tightly packed and cordoned off by tape, in various drop-in respite centres in the city.
“This is a second-tier, second-class shelter system, and we are a second-class city to allow it to happen,” the nurse said.
@JohnTory saw you on @CP24 How will your polite meetings requesting help from the federal gov’t help this? pic.twitter.com/tjKv7kfA1k— CathyCrowe (@cathyacrowe) January 23, 2019
While the problem continues, the city will be adding almost 500 new spaces, with 200 beds to be located in North York for refugees.
“Refugees are quite overrepresented in the shelter population, and so that program at Yonge and Finch will be very much tailored to the unique needs of single refugee claimants.”
Refugees have come to represent roughly 36% of the shelter system since 2016, with both the Roxham border crossers and the Syrian population requiring assistance, likely due to high housing costs in urban areas.
Gord Tanner, director of homelessness initiatives and prevention services, made the expansion announcement, while also pointing out that it’s the sixth winter in a row the city has scaled up services.
“Despite continually adding new capacity to the shelter system the occupancy rate remains really unchanged, around 98-99 percent,” he said"

According to an announcement by Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s President, 53 billion barrels of crude have been found, boosting overall reserves by nearly one-third.
The announcement by Hassan Rouhani comes as Iran faces crushing American sanctions after the U.S. pulled out of its nuclear deal with world powers last year.
“I am telling the White House that in the days when you sanctioned the sale of Iranian oil and pressured our nation, the country’s dear workers and engineers were able to discover 53 billion barrels of oil in a big field,” Rouhani said.
The addition of 53 billion barrels worth of exploitable oil officially pushes Iran past Canada, making it the world’s third-largest holder of crude.
The new field is expected to be the nation’s second-largest, after the 65 billion barrel behemoth currently located in Ahvaz.
While new reserves are a potential boon to Iran, an overall increase in production or sales are unlikely as the nation remains in an economically precarious zone due to U.S. sanctions.
Largely unable to secure new investments, discoveries of new resources are for show, with development simply being too expensive. This has already occurred even with resource projects financed by China, which maintains a $400 billion stake in Iran’s energy sector."

Meng’s wanted in the United States for charges related to the Chinese tech-giant’s violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran, allegedly conducting business with the rogue Islamist state through a front company in Hong Kong.
Shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017, he withdrew the United States from the ‘Iran nuclear deal’, favouring sanctions and sabre rattling to prevent Iran from enriching uranium and building nuclear weapons.
Caught between two economic and military superpowers, Canada got a bit of reprieve this week, at least our pig farmers did, after China lifted its embargo on Canadian pork while similar, retaliatory prohibitions remain for our canola and beef.
If these problems weren’t enough, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s previous government delayed a decision whether to allow Huawei 5G technology onto our domestic telecommunications network – the United States has already banned it over national security concerns.
During a CBC interview aired Monday with Susan Rice, the former U.S. national security advisor to President Barack Obama echoed these concerns and said Huawei 5G presented a clear and present danger.
“It’s hard for me to emphasize adequately, without getting into classified terrain, how serious it is, particularly for countries involved in the Five Eyes,” said Rice who explained threat, then suggested the signals intelligence alliance (Five Eyes) between U.S., Canada, UK, New Zealand and Australia would be jeopardized if Canada went ahead with Huawei 5G.
Huawei isn’t the only company that can provide 5G, purportedly capable of 10 gigabytes-per-second of data transfer that can activate a Bluetooth ‘internet of things’ world where all gadgets are operable via smartphone.
But Huawei’s current proliferation in the marketplace and its ties with the Chinese Communist Party, as The Post Millennial previously reported, raise questions about why the Trudeau government dithers on this national security front.
“It gives the China the ability, if they choose to use it, to access all kinds of information, civilian intelligence, military, that could be very, very compromising. As much as I disagree with the Trump administration on a number of things, on this their concern about Huawei, I believe they’re right.”
Rice went on to say that if Canada were to allow the technology on its telecom infrastructure that would forever change the security relationship between our countries.
“That would put the security collaboration which serves the security interests of every Canadian and every American, into jeopardy,” Rice said.  “It can’t be done. I don’t see how we can share (intelligence) in the way we have. It’s not a joke. It’s truly serious.”
National security concerns about Huawei 5G are not new – New Zealand and Australia have followed America’s lead, while UK and Canada dither – despite warnings from intelligence experts, and now the former U.S. national security advisor.
Adding more complications to the diplomatic mess, and the Trudeau government’s inability to make a decision on Huawei 5G – one Rice’s interview indicates should be a no-brainer – is the extent to which Huawei has wormed its way into Canadian university research, and the money mainland China students pay to attend post-secondary here.
According to internal documents from the University of British Columbia obtained by National Post, after Meng’s arrest, faculty and administrators were more worried about losing Chinese students, related Huawei research deals and estranging faculty from China, than national security or the university’s integrity.
Huawei research sponsorship at UBC is currently worth $9.5 million and mainland China students make up nearly 10 percent of total enrolment at the university; 5,717 or approximately one-third of all international students at the school.
In the day’s following Meng’s arrest as she was transiting through Vancouver International Airport, teachers and admin contemplated a PR strategy to combat commentary in media critical of Canadian universities’ relations with Huawei.
On December 10, the same day Kovrig and Spavor were arrested in China – the pair have since been accused of espionage – Paul Evans, an Asia expert at UBC’s public policy school wrote colleagues proposing they decide whether to be “proactive or reactive” to events that could impact research cash or students from the communist regime."

According to a recent report from the CBC, Jo-Ann Roberts is considering recruiting former Liberal Cabinet Minister and now independent MP, Jody Wilson-Raybould to the party’s top job.
Wilson-Raybould is the only Independent in the House of Commons after she was kicked out of Liberal Party by Justin Trudeau over the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Then, attorney general, Wilson-Raybould said she was bullied and pressured by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his office to spare the SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec engineering firm with Liberal ties from prosecution.
The federal government has blocked almost all genuine investigation into the matter, with the RCMP even facing difficulties when it comes to having confidentiality waived on key witnesses.
Although hopeful, Jo-Ann Roberts has not reached out yet, as she believes former party leader Elizabeth May will take the lead on recruiting, given her close relationship with Wilson-Raybould, and the close working proximity on the hill.
May has previously attempted to recruit Wilson-Raybould, following the SNC-Lavalin affair, offering her the leadership even back then.
While the interim leader has stated her hopes to recruit Wilson-Raybould, she has also stated that her party is actively looking at other strong candidates who could join the leadership race."

Time is running out, the scientists say: “The climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected. It is more severe than anticipated, threatening natural ecosystems and the fate of humanity.”
The original statement published in the journal BioScience on the 40th anniversary of the first world climate conference involved collaborative work by dozens of scientists and was endorsed by the roughly 11,258 from 153 nations.
That number of endorsers has now been reduced, after a public outcry regarding fake names, including Micky Mouse and Albus Dumbledore appearing on the list.
While fake names are worrying, the list didn’t stop there, it also included a naturopath, a hypnotist, a commercial business analyst, a psychologist, and an industrial designer, all individuals who wouldn’t normally be categorized as scientists.
The original report has since been updated to remove a total of 34 “invalid” names."

On Wednesday, rookie and returning Conservative MPs who voters sent to Ottawa gathered with senators for a caucus at West Block to discuss the federal party’s future and its leadership in the aftermath of a losing, Liberal minority government finish on Oct. 21.
Under the shadow of petroleum icon EnCana’s HQ exodus last week to Denver, Colorado, a nationalized $4.5 billion “leaky pipeline” that cannot get twinned, soured relations with China and uncertain USMCA trade deal ratification stateside, some reporters remained fixated by embattled party leader Andrew Scheer’s position on gay sex.
I use the term “gay sex”, because one reporter’s combative entrée and followup question during Scheer’s scrum, after he survived his first leadership test at caucus, was phrased in rather Biblical terms: “Do you believe that being gay is a sin?”
And the reporter did not stop:
Scheer finally stands up to a reporter! As all conservatives should when met with such biased/bigoted/bullying questions. It's only a month late! https://t.co/EyetrxkjZw— Candice Malcolm (@CandiceMalcolm) November 7, 2019
This line of questioning is inspired by a facile notion that if Scheer won’t march in a Pride parade, which he hasn’t, then the public is left with no other option than to believe the Conservative leader would roll back LGBT rights to the Age of Antiquity.
As Scheer attempted to reiterate his party’s inclusiveness–something he’s repeated ad nauseam since longtime Liberal minister Ralph Goodale (defeated this election) tweeted a 15-year-old speech against gay marriage Scheer made as a backbencher –the reporter interjected:
“But you’re not giving your personal opinion,” demanding that he come clean.
Scheer: “My personal opinion is that I respect the rights of every single Canadian… and to always fight for the rights of every single Canadian, including the LGBT community.”

Goodale’s August 22nd Tweet, boosted a day later by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Svengali of divisiveness, Gerald Butts (no longer available on Twitter), triggered media who in the moment, conveniently forgot that like Scheer, and on two occasions himself Goodale also voted against the notion of same sex unions in the Commons.
Goodale’s bit of craven hypocrisy was ably noted by National Post‘s Chris Selley in the same 24-hour news cycle, but the media remained hellbent on the subject, pestering Scheer about it prior to the official election period and throughout, tossing in abortion too because why not – all Christians hate that, too, right?
Even the U.S. Democratic Party took a similar anti-gay marriage position up until the end of President Barack Obama’s second term in 2012.
But besides the mainstream media’s selective application of its religiosity matrix that lit the firestorm over Scheer and Pride, America’s first black POTUS’ endorsement of Trudeau in the 11th-hour of a campaign blighted by #TrudeauBlackface was ironic in itself, on top of a gleeful reception of it by Butts and Co.
On the matter of Old Testament crime and punishment, affixing it Scheer’s Christianity and employing conjecture that he would impose “God’s law” on Canadians were he ever PM, it’s worth taking some time to unpack this to understand the level of cockamamie logic it took to arrive at such an idea.
So come on a journey back through time to a relatively lawless period about 1,000 years after the invention of soap, and some 3,100 years before the discovery of penicillin, when Genesis was written.
Interpretations differ on what actually happened between Noah and his son Ham in the Old Testament’s first chapter, when God populates the Earth, gives humans free will, then gets very angry when they misbehave.
Some believe Ham sodomized his father, others insist Noah walked in on Ham railing one of Noah’s wives.
Regardless, Ham’s fate for his transgression leaves his son Canaan “cursed”; his descendants known as Canaanites are enslaved by the Israelites, who  later murder them all after God commanded the children of Ham be annihilated.
Harsh punishment indeed, and similar incidents pepper the Bible for all types of sexual sinning including God’s destruction of the twin dens of iniquity, Sodom and Gomorrah.  Leviticus edicts set down around the 6th century BCE–Babylonian times–have been interpreted as injunctions on incest and homosexuality; citations later weaponized by the Church to persecute gays well into the 20th century.
Though the issue of gay marriage rights in Canada is settled in law, and has been since 2005 when we became the first country outside of Europe to legalize such unions, a largely esoteric debate about Old Testament scripture and “God’s word” on homosexuality continues in theological circles and online forums.
But by and large, anti-gay interpretations profited by those clamouring for the gay marriage law to be reversed, have largely been reduced to fringe views in wider Canadian society.
Unfortunately, outside the castle walls of places like Canada in which hate crimes are pursued and prosecuted, the body count continues to rise for scores of unwitting LGBT victims of Islamic State, Iran, Putin’s Russia and myriad global backwaters where life is cheap and human rights codes, non-existent.
The 20th century is littered with state sanctioned and monitored behaviour regimes, ideological impositions–religious or irreligious–that ended with the murder of millions in places like China, where this very moment the regime rounds up Uiyger Muslim men for re-education camps, Uiyger women left to be raped by the local Chinese.
These parallel applications of guilt-by-association or non-association, in the extreme–and that’s what we’re talking about here, the extreme application of ideology whatever that happens to be–are reduced to trifling footnotes whenever next year’s pride roll call is taken by some of the more militant Pride committees.
While Scheer’s attendance at such an event is demanded to prove his “solidarity” with LGBT, conversely some Pride organizers prevent community police officers from marching in solidarity, or put caveats on their attire; either anathema to the original Pride mantra of inclusiveness and love, regrettably lost as well in this fog of cognitive dissonance.
It’s so predictable in a way, and even used as comedic device in a 1990s Seinfeld episode, where Kramer’s attendance at an NYC March for AIDS is insufficient and he’s beset upon to “wear the ribbon”.
But these contradictions never seem to bother reporters too much, except when the aim is to smear, as Vice magazine did when it “outed” then-Conservative Foreign Affairs Minister John “Rusty” Baird in 2013.
In this abject bit of gibberish–Is Canada Run by a Gay Mafia?–the author remains seemingly oblivious to the fact that if Baird is gay, he likely wanted it kept a secret whilst travelling to commit statecraft in backwaters that still handed out cruel and unusual punishment for homosexuality.
If you can stomach the snark, it is insightful reading for a taste of the mainstream’s paragon of virtue mindset, considering that outside of Western and westernized nations, it’s a hard time whatsoever finding a Pride event, let alone getting any sort of LGBT rights, particularly in the Old Testament’s cradle.
Unless of course, you happen to reside in modern day Jerusalem for example.
In the Holy Land and not far from Jerusalem Pride, LGBT rights are pretty much non-existent. The political strife in Egypt has seen LGBT there harassed and arrested, Syria is in ruin following civil war and Islamic State infestation, and in nearby Ramallah or Gaza Strip, forget about it.
Asylum seeker John Calvin–a Christian convert and grandson of Palestinian terror group Hamas’ co-founder–told CNN in 2015 as much, before his asylum claim was denied by Canadian authorities and Calvin sought refuge in New York City.
Yet Scheer’s Pride avoidance–perhaps a national record of some kind, like his claim he won the “strongest majority government in Canada’s history” in #elxn43–remains a constant source of aggravation for members of the press gallery, despite plenty of issues arguably more worthy of asking Opposition members’ to opine upon.
Our country is on the brink of total Balkanization. There is no doubt about that. It’s spurred by separatist sentiments in the West, a resurgence of separatists Bloc Québecois and Indigenous leaders, like Treaty 8 chiefs caught in the middle who are speaking out. The situation only becomes more contentious with Bloc MPs holding a go-to power balance in the Commons.
When this East-West divide couldn’t get any worse, we remain a doormat for illegal migrants making bogus asylum claims that further burden an already overloaded immigration system.
Given this totally unnecessary, quasi-domestic/foreign affairs baggage and presented with former Immigration critic for Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition, Calgary Nose Hill MP Michelle Rempel, media still required a few minutes from her to opine on Scheer’s Pride no-shows.
Here is a two-minute exchange on the issue that occurred during Conservatives’ Wednesday confab, when MPs slip out to fill news slots and talk politics without divulging any specifics about ongoing caucus deliberations. In this context, without anything else to talk about, reporters were primed and so was Rempel.
#CPC MP Michelle Rempel DEFENDS Andrew Scheer refusal to attend Pride Parades – calling ones participation at Pride ""symbolism"" (her word|) The last thing the #LGBTQ community needs is symbolism by politicians (like Trudeau) – action is needed on issues, not symbolism #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/p67DAetGM4— G.T. Lem (@gtlem) November 6, 2019
But how many will pay any mind or attention to other aspects of Rempel’s response–a laundry list of real discrimination LGBT folks in Canada still face and how her party is committed to addressing them.
For G.T. Lem–who bills himself on Twitter as “1 Source For Videos That Cut Through The Right-Wing Noise & Counters The Anti-Liberal Bias Narrative With FACTS”–his takeaway is that Rempel “DEFENDS” Scheer’s choice, while downplaying her (rather accurate) description of what’s become a “symbolic” political litmus test.
Forget that there are LGBT people who do not go to Pride, for whatever reason and non-LGBT folks, who love it. Having freedom of choice and rights also means the right not to participate or being kowtowed to do so, but if you’re Scheer or anyone who takes a position contrary to supposed mainstream progressivism, then look out.
If you had just arrived from another planet, or were transported by time machine from Ancient Babylon, you’d probably think the entirety of Planet Earth had gone mad; mankind’s inhabitants anyways, or as Trudeau calls us: Peoplekind.
Whatever the collective mental state of the nation, CBC’s Rosemary Barton is also under the spell of Scheer’s take on LGBT rights and took to Twitter to punctuate his response to the low-rent ‘is being gay a sin’ query.
Scheer was asked if believes homosexuality is a sin. He says his personal opinion is that he respects the rights of all Canadians and fight for the rights of all Canadians.— Rosemary Barton (@RosieBarton) November 7, 2019
And so the inordinate amount of time spent on Scheer’s Pride record, apparent harbinger for low information voters and media types who believe a Conservative Scheer government would quash all and sunder rights for our LGBT neighbours, friends and colleagues. Nobody credible seriously believes this garbage, yet media remain transfixed it’s a totally real possibility and one the day’s most pressing issue.
Unfortunately, or fortunately–depending on one’s political persuasion or adherence to social mores–the Q&A moment about alleged gay sinners competed against what was perhaps Scheer’s finest stump speech hour, given in fewer than seven minutes to reporters, and seven weeks too late.
With a nod to “a frank discussion (in caucus) about the last election campaign”, acknowledging his disappointment and desire “to get it right the next time”, Scheer launched into a rebuke of Trudeau that rings as true today, as it was when the campaign began on September 11.
“The sad truth is, Trudeau has left this country more divided than ever before,” said Scheer. “Picking fights with premiers, pitting region against region, Trudeau has set the stage for a national unity crisis… this is Trudeau’s mess but Conservatives are here to clear it up.
Though it’s never too late for Scheer to attend one of Canada’s smorgasbord of annual Pride events, even in a far flung place like Inuvik, Northwest Territories, for Conservatives’ governing fortunes, their leader’s newfound gumption isn’t going to re-order the planets or turn back the clock to August 22.
That’s when Scheer and his advisors should have hit this head on. But they didn’t and here we are in this parallel universe of litmus tests and virtue signalling, heading into the 44th federal government frame, a minority government no less, as serious national challenges boil in realpolitik, both domestic and foreign.
After his caucus voted down a change to the party’s constitution enabling it to toss their captain–a mandate that still remains within party’s membership purview–Scheer emerged swinging for the fences promising to restore “ethics and accountability” and getting “the energy sector back to work.”
As Trudeau spent the last few days at his favourite surfing spot in Tofino, B.C., home of Pacific Rim National Park, Scheer demanded the PM return to Ottawa and blasted our G7 surfer dude for “stok(ing) the revival of the separatist Bloc Quebecois and has sown the seeds of disunity in the West”.
“These are pressing issues of national importance that need to be addressed so I am calling on Justin Trudeau to reconvene Parliament as soon as possible, to do so.”
So will Canadian voters give Scheer a second chance and will media extract the same pound of flesh from Trudeau for his perceived shortcomings? That remains to be seen. Conservative Party members will have the first say anyways, at a mandatory leadership review set for their April convention next year.
As for Trudeau, his immediate future will depend on the confidence of the House, pretty much a sure-thing given he can tack right or left for support without having to compromise with Conservatives.
And as for Scheer and the LGBT issue, stay tuned for Pride Month June 2020, if he even lasts that long.  In the interim, Scheer said that Baird has been tapped to conduct “a thorough and external review of the campaign”."

“It all started when teachers, counsellors, and some students said we should wear the rainbow poppy…” She wrote, stating that she disagreed with the decision to change the traditional red-and-black poppy used to honour Canadian veterans during the Remembrance Day holiday. “I typed up papers on a computer, printed them off, and taped them up in the halls.”
The printed papers contained some quotes from news stories and people on social media Natalie had collected of individuals expressing criticism of the rainbow poppy. Natalie says she was just trying to express her beliefs and opinion on the matter.
“As I was putting them up, teachers were taking them down. I watched as they took them to the office and gave them to the secretary.”
Natalie says she went to class, but was called to the office soon after. There, the Principal and Vice Principal—Jason Calissis and Bryce Baldwin—were waiting, and Natalie alleges they began to yell at her and accuse her of posting “hate speech.”
“They accused me of hate speech and endangering the physical safety of the group of individuals [LGBT students].” Natalie says, “They asked me what I was thinking, and I told them everything … I said I was just voicing my beliefs and morals.”
Natalie says the two male administrators continued to accuse her of “hate speech,” and she became so scared at one point that she was on the verge of tears. “I got to the point of almost crying but I didn’t. I had to be the voice for all those families who were greatly disrespected and offended.”
Natalie is the cousin of former federal MP candidate Cyara Bird, who ran on the Conservative Party ticket in the 2019 general election for the Churchill-Keewatinook Aski riding. Bird, a member of the Little Black River First Nation, tells The Post Millennial that there are World War Two veterans in their family.
Upon trying to record the conversation with the Principal and Vice Principal on her cell phone, Natalie says her phone was confiscated and she was suspended until after Remembrance Day.
“So I asked why? Why am I being suspended and punished for expressing my feelings? And they said everybody is entitled to their own beliefs, opinions, and way of life. So I asked, why am I not?”
Natalie says her parents were notified at the end of the suspension order. Her father confirmed that he witnessed her phone being returned to her after he arrived to pick her up, and also confirmed that she is not allowed to return to school until Tuesday. They stated that the exact reason for suspension was “hate speech,” not a specific refusal to wear the rainbow poppy. Bird noted that Natalie’s father is “very proud” of his daughter.
The Post Millennial attempted to reach out to Stonewall Collegiate for comment, but was told they would not provide comments to media, aggressively advising us to “Google” the number for the Superintendent before hanging up. The Interlake School Board Superintendent did not return calls, but a statement issued on the Board’s twitter read that no staff member “mandated” a student wear a rainbow poppy.
They did not comment on the suspensions, or whether a student was suspended for voicing an opinion which rejected the rainbow poppy as a symbol, as in the case of Natalie.

The 17-year-old cousin of a former Conservative MP hopeful in the 2019 federal election and her friend have been suspended from Stonewall Collegiate for distributing a poster explaining her rejection of the idea of wearing a rainbow poppy.
Cyara Bird of the Little Black River First Nation, who was on the ballot for the Churchill-Keewatinook Aski riding of northern Manitoba this past election, took to Twitter tonight to express her anger after learning her cousin and another student had both been suspended for “hate speech” after rejecting the idea that rainbow poppies should replace the traditional red-and-black ones worn during their school’s Remembrance Day performance.
The young woman, who is half African-Canadian, asked instead to wear the red-and-black poppy traditional to the festivities, finding the rainbow poppy “disrespectful” to the World War 2 veterans in her family. Upon expressing her opinion, she and another student who shared her sentiment were sent to the principal’s office. According to Bird, the girl’s parents were not notified until after the suspension was applied.
https://twitter.com/CyaraBird/status/1192229576719470592?s=20
Bird also posted a message from her cousin’s father which read that the young woman had attempted to record the school administrators admonishing her using her cellphone, but that they noticed and confiscated her phone in response.
Speaking to The Post Millennial, Bird said her cousin, Natalie, had attempted to record the suspension orders in her voice memos application, wanting to show her parents what was happening. When the principal saw, her cellphone was “snatched away” and she was told there would be “consequences” if she posted about the suspension on social media or went to the press.
Natalie will not be allowed to return to school until after Remembrance Day.
Bird believes the suspension is unjust, and will negatively impact her cousin’s self-esteem.
“At 17, you are growing into yourself, you are learning to speak out against things you think are wrong.” she says, “What kind of message does this send to a young woman? That they are not supposed to speak out against something they disagree with.”
Rainbow poppies were introduced as a concept in 2016 by some LGBT groups in a push they say is to honour LGBT veterans, but it has caused controversy amongst those who say it is unnecessary, with the red poppy honouring all veterans regardless of sexuality.
Bird, whose grandfather is a World War 2 veteran, expressed frustration at the entire ordeal. “The pride we have because of our grandfather fighting in World War 2 is strong. We all wear poppies. [Natalie] was not opposing wearing one—she just did not want to wear one she felt was disrespectful to the veterans.”
The Post Millennial has reached out to Stonewall Collegiate for confirmation but has not heard back by the time of publication.
Update: The Post Millennial attempted to reach out to Stonewall Collegiate Thursday morning for comment, but was told they would not provide comments to media, aggressively advising us to “Google” the number for the Superintendent before hanging up. The Interlake School Board Superintendent did not return calls, but a statement issued on the Board’s twitter read that no staff member “mandated” a student wear a rainbow poppy.
They did not comment on the suspensions, or whether a student was suspended for voicing an opinion which rejected the rainbow poppy as a symbol, as in the case of Natalie. On November 8th, Cyara Bird issued a statement on her Twitter addressing the viral fallout from the coverage of her initial tweets, apologizing that her “words were misconstrued.”
Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that the student was suspended for distributing a poster that detailed her reasons for rejecting the rainbow poppy. The title has also been amended to make it clearer that the two students were suspended for arguing against the idea of wearing rainbow poppies."

“Is that your mail-order bride?” Jabbour is seen repeatedly pointing at the Asian partner of the attendee, before asking “How much? How much did you pay?”
Jabbour, who identified herself to Press for Truth reporter Dan Dicks in a separate video as representing the PACE society with colleagues at the protest, is also seen yelling at and following the police officers protecting the entrance of the Pan Pacific Hotel, stating “your only purpose is oppressing people” and demanding to be allowed inside the private venue, where the debate was taking place in the conference room.
In Dicks’ video, Jabbour is also seen confronting an unidentified cameraperson. Jabbour aggressively approaches the woman, goading “next time you kick me, it better be f*cking hard, b*tch!” Jabbour had tripped over the camera person’s leg moments prior. Jabbour then attempts to lick the woman’s camera before rushing back to Dicks and holding her hand over his filming cell phone. Both journalists are also targeted by Jabbour blowing cigarette smoke at them.
Jabbour is listed as the Occupational Health and Safety Facilitator for the PACE Society, a charity focused on de-stigmatizing sex work and supporting sex workers. Jabbour is also the founder of Sault Ste. Marie Sex Workers’ Rights.
PACE Society’s most recently published annual report states the 62% of their funding is provided by the government, with the City of Vancouver and the Province of British Columbia appearing to provide the majority of the support. While this information is not provided in any subsequent reports, the 2015 annual report stated that 82% of PACE’s funding was spent on salaries for staff.
The Post Millennial reached out to Jabbour via the PACE Society, but PACE instead offered an email where “comments or concerns” could be sent. When clarification was sought on whether or not a comment would be given, PACE hung up, and subsequent calls were not answered."

May announced on Monday that she wanted to step down when the party had momentum, saying, “I have to look at what’s the best interest for the party,” to the media.
BREAKING: @ElizabethMay is expected to announce she will resign as leader of the Green Party shortly.— Don Martin (@DonMartinCTV) November 4, 2019
Jo-Ann Roberts, the current Deputy Leader of the party will take over as interim leader.
While notable, the news was expected, as a week earlier, May announced that she was planning to step down “within the next four years,” though she had announced at the time that she would continue to serve as MP for Sannich-Gulf Islands.
Elizabeth May nearly doubled her vote since 2015, leading to one new Green MP being added to a caucus of two.
In Elizabeth May's first election in 2008, the Greens took 6.8% of the vote and won zero seats. In her last election in 2019, the Greens took 6.5% of the vote and won three seats. Change in support was primarily in B.C. and Atlantic Canada.— Éric Grenier (@EricGrenierCBC) November 4, 2019
Alongside her resignation, May confirmed previous suspicions with a caveat by announcing that she would make a bid for the role of Speaker of the House after the next election.
While she has resigned as leader, May will stay on as an MP, will be leader of the party in the House, and continue to work with the Green Party.
The newest Green MP (Fredericton, New Brunswick) Jenica Atwin says she will not run for the leadership.
“I really need to focus on my constituency, there’s a lot of work that needs to be done in Fredericton, and I just don’t think it would be right for me to focus on leadership at the moment,” said Atwin at the press conference.
“I mean, audacity, bravery, the same qualities that I would use to describe Ms. May and the leadership style she’s had over the last ten years. It’s just about continuing to maybe change the language, to reach further beyond our current support base and to encourage others to join us in this fight. To be strong and fearless and much of that work has already been done,” Atwin continued.
According to May, the Greens will hold their leadership convention on October 2-4, 2020, bringing with it a new long-term leader.
“I want to encourage people who voted Green to get involved… speak up for what you want to see in the next Green Party leader of Canada.”
During the 2019 election, May criticized Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer for still holding his American citizen, believing she had “renounced” hers when becoming a Canadian. Immigration lawyers specializing in U.S. citizenship told The Post Millennial May is almost certainly still an American, too.
Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer thanked May for her public service as a politician on Twitter.
“Thank you @ElizabethMay for your many years of service to Canadians as Leader of the Green Party, and I wish you well as you continue to serve your constituents in Saanich-Gulf Islands.”
May has said controversial things in the past, including saying at a press gallery dinner, “Omar Khadr, you’ve got more class than the whole f—ing [CPC] cabinet.”"

Following the federal election results a couple weeks ago, Canadians from coast to coast will be looking to Ottawa to see how Trudeau tries to pull the country together, or doesn’t.
While the Liberals still hold a strong minority, they were completely shut out between Winnipeg and Vancouver and have lost the confidence of many western Canadians.
Although there are many factors one can cite for this complete collapse of support out west, chief among them is the failure of the Trudeau government to get any pipelines built from Alberta to the west coast.
Much of this challenge was brought about thanks to the government’s incompetence, intentional perhaps, given their stated goal of “phasing out” the oilsands. It makes one wonder if they actually want to get any shovels in the ground and pipe laid down.
While there is no need to rehash the failures of the past at this point, the challenge for the Prime Minister is what to do going forward, especially in a weakened minority government situation. Despite buying the Kinder Morgan pipeline, much to the chagrin of the anti-oil crowd in his party and those left of his party, the construction of said pipeline remains stagnant, thanks in large part to regulatory hurdles put in place by his government from bills C-69 and C-48.
To put it bluntly, in his quest to “balance” both the environmental and economic concerns of this country, Trudeau has put himself between a rock and a hard place.
However, there is a potential compromise that he could make that would hopefully satisfy the concerns of those in both the pro- and anti-pipeline crowds.
The Eagle Spirit Pipeline, an Indigenous backed effort to build an energy corridor consisting of two oil pipelines and two natural gas pipelines from Fort McMurray, Alberta, to Grassy Point, B.C., could be the perfect solution.
The project has the backing of 35 Indigenous communities who live along the route and are looking to share in the prosperity and employment that such a broad initiative could bring to their communities.
Calvin Helin, a member of the Lax Kw’alaams Band which is located close to where the proposed coastal access point would be and the CEO of Eagle Spirit Energy Holding, has said that while there are small pockets of resistance to the project, the vast majority of First Nations affected by the proposed route are very supportive.
However, according to Helin, much of that opposition comesv from Indigenous people who are backed by third-party groups looking to stop any resource development in Canada.
“They’re just puppets and props for American environmental groups,” he said.
Bill C-48, commonly known as the tanker ban bill, is one of the biggest challenges the project now faces. Helin is challenging the constitutionality of the bill, saying that First Nations were not adequately consulted.
“As ancestral defenders of our traditional trade routes, we will not stand by and allow the shut down of Canada’s resource industries,” Helin told the National Post in July of 2019.
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has also indicated that his government would look to challenge the federal government on these same grounds.
Trudeau has the power to direct his natural resources minister to grant a ministerial exemption to the tanker ban in this situation. For the good of the economy, the unity of the country, and the First Nations who support the project, he would be wise to grant it.
Helin has stated in the past that if this project fails to get the green light from the federal government, they will move the access point up the coast to Alaska, where they already have a memorandum of understanding signed with a landowner who is willing to grant them access to the coast.
Even former longtime NDP Member of Parliament Nathan Cullen, usually a staunch opponent of pipelines, has shown support for the project.
“My highest order principles are First Nation rights and title because that’s law, and I respect it,” Cullen told the CBC last year.
As Trudeau decides how to formulate his cabinet and set out the priorities for his second opportunity running the federal government, he would do well to consider supporting the Eagle Spirit Pipeline.
We are a resource-based country and, whether Canadians like it or not, the demand for our oil and gas is not going away any time soon. Our oil will be coming out of the ground for years to come, and it will be either sent to the B.C. coast or the Alaskan coast.
Considering that a pipeline is the safest and most environmentally conscious way to transport oil, what good reason does the Prime Minister have for not supporting such an ideal project that will help so many?"
0,2019-11-03T06:21:36.000-05:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/behind-the-scenes-other-oil-producing-countries-are-surely-laughing-at-canada,"Behind the scenes, other oil-producing countries are surely laughing at Canada","If you have a bunch of stuff in the ground that other people want to buy, and you can use the money from that stuff to give good jobs to tons of people and build roads, schools, and everything else across a vast landmass, it’s pretty much a no-brainer that you would sell that stuff.
And, for most of the world, that’s exactly how it goes.
Regardless of ideology, political system, national history, or any other factor, it seems that every place that has a substantial amount of oil uses that oil to help fuel their prosperity and development.
There’s a clear understanding that the benefits of selling oil, especially in a world that still needs a whole bunch of it, are immense.
As a result, the idea of transporting oil across your country so you can sell it isn’t really a big controversy, and the countries that sell it certainly don’t allow foreign interests to try and shut down their home-grown oil sector.
Except of course, in Canada.
While the rest of the world goes on producing more oil to meet the projected continued growth in demand, here in Canada our industry is buckling.
Large segments of some provincial governments and the federal government have been effectively hijacked by foreign interests hell-bent on turning Canadians against our own energy sector and shutting down our production.
And most disturbingly, our country is letting it happen.
Just imagine what the rest of the world thinks as they watch this, particularly the world’s other oil-producing countries.
Countries like Russia, Saudia Arabia, Iran and even our own ally the United States must be absolutely loving it, and they’re surely laughing at us behind the scenes.
As they keep profiting from oil, and plan to keep profiting for a long time to come, they’re watching Canada – a competitor to them – let our own gigantic oil reserves go to waste.
They know very well that any money not made in Canada will just flow towards them, so they will benefit while we suffer.
Furthermore, they’re probably stunned to see that Canada is letting foreign money – especially US money – be used to take down our oil industry, especially since oil production in the US continues to surge.
And they’re definitely thinking of all the things they would do with Canada’s vast oil reserves, and can probably barely comprehend how we’re putting all of that at risk.
The fact is, the demonization campaign against Alberta’s oil sands and against Canada’s energy industry is making us the suckers of the world, and other countries won’t hesitate to take advantage of us."

According to the CBC, roughly 700 people came to a separatist event hosted at Edmonton’s Boot Scootin’ Boogie Dancehall.
The event was originally planned for a smaller venue but was moved after interest passed room capacity.
The event attendees organized from a Vote Wexit Facebook group which has more than 262,000 members, and the Wexit Alberta Facebook page which currently has about 30,000 members,
According to Wexit leader Peter Downing, support for the group rapidly grew following the re-election of Justin Trudeau, forcing issues such as the carbon tax and equalization formulas to the front for many westerners.
“We will not allow ourselves to be divided. We’re going to make Alberta great again, and that is when we cut ourselves off from the leach that is eastern Canada,” said Downing.
While Alberta remains a largely Conservative province, Downing maintains that his group is neither a left-wing nor right-wing movement.
“It is for everybody except for eastern Canada,” he said.
The organization plans to register as a political party, and Wexit Alberta will start drafting the province’s first constitution in the near future, he said.
“Monday morning we are going to be filing our application with Elections Canada for the official registration of Wexit Canada,” Downing said to the enthusiastic crowd.
“We’re going to do for Western Canada and Alberta in particular what the Bloc Québécois does for Quebec but the only difference is we’re cutting the parasite of Eastern Canada off from our necks.”
Downing lastly released a letter directed at Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.
“We are calling on you to legislate a referendum on Alberta’s separation from Canada,” the letter reads. “You or any one of your 62 MLAs can draft a bill to formulate a referendum on a clear and unequivocal question as to whether the people of Alberta wish to remain a part of Canada.”"

The person who pays for something has the right to decide how that thing operates and what it does. This also holds true for the government, as Canada’s religious minorities are finding out the hard way.
Mill Stream Bible Camp, a 90-minute drive north-east of Toronto, welcomes all children to its summer camps, where they enjoy swimming, archery, canoeing, basketball and other ways to experience fun, recreation and hope.
The same goes for Mount Traber Bible Camp in Nova Scotia, whose stated aim is “to show the love of Jesus Christ to boys and girls in a wholesome and fun way in the great outdoors.”
Both camps rely heavily on volunteer labour and donations.
Both camps provide generous financial assistance to families who lack the means to pay the regular registration costs. Many underprivileged children are, therefore, able to enjoy summer camps.
In 2018, both camps were denied Canada Summer Jobs grants because they refused to check off an “attestation” expressing their agreement with Justin Trudeau’s belief that abortion is a Charter right.
After the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms and others fought court actions against this compelled speech, the federal government toned down its attestation for 2019. Canada Summer Jobs now requires that non-profits and businesses agree to refrain from undermining or restricting “the exercise of rights legally protected in Canada.” Both Mill Stream Bible Camp and Mount Traber Bible Camp could and did, in good conscience, agree with this rather vague attestation. This should have been the end of the matter.
But the federal government found another way to prevent Christian organizations from receiving Canada Summer Job grants.
With the direct involvement of Prime Minister Trudeau, the government created an excessive list of new “ineligibility” rules for the Canada Summer Jobs program. Federal bureaucrats now scour the web looking for “offensive” religious teachings that run counter to the woke gospel of identity politics. The intolerant, judgmental slogans of “inclusion,” “equity,” and “diversity” now run government policy.
In 2019 both camps were denied grants due to “controversial church doctrines” and “discriminatory” hiring practices based on church beliefs. These “controversial” beliefs have been taught for thousands of years by many Christian churches, for example: people are sinful and have separated themselves from a righteous and holy God; our immortal souls will eventually spend all eternity in heaven with God, or in hell apart from God; Jesus alone offers salvation; an authentic Christian lifestyle includes sexual purity.
These teachings are pure heresy to those who deny the existence of God, or those who reject the idea of a perfect and demanding God who does not tolerate sin. The very idea of the existence of hell, or any need to be saved from it, is distasteful to the secular progressives who run Canada. Any suggestion of sexual restraint generates intense and even rabid opposition from most atheists, agnostics, relativists, progressives and other secularists.
However, secular progressives, as well as traditional religious believers, have developed answers to the moral and philosophical questions of why we exist, and how we should live our lives. Secular and religious beliefs about compassion, kindness and honesty cannot be measured or described scientifically, and fall into the realms of philosophy and metaphysics.
In a free and democratic society, the government should be neutral on metaphysical beliefs. Further, a free country is supposed to tolerate authentic diversity, such that individuals and groups can access government programs without holding to the “correct” metaphysical beliefs. Practically speaking, diversity and neutrality should mean that when theists are in charge of government, they do not seek to punish atheists for adhering to the “wrong” beliefs. Likewise, when atheists or other secularists are in power, they should not seek to punish Christians or other theists for living by the “wrong” beliefs.
In violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canada Summer Jobs program has been used by the Trudeau government to punish Christian summer children’s camps, purely for not following the “correct” beliefs about God, morality, eternity and sin. This deliberate exclusion of Christian ministries from Canada Summer Jobs grants has been carried out in the name of “inclusion,” “diversity,” and “non-discrimination.” How our courts will deal with this state-mandated secularist intolerance remains to be seen.
Apart from the performance of Canadian courts in upholding (or negating) our Charter freedoms, many religious believers need to re-think their decades-old love affair with big government. From the 1930s through to the 1960s and beyond, Christians embraced, or at least did not oppose, the government’s gradual takeover of health care, education, and numerous social services and charitable activities that used to be operated primarily by religious organizations. What started out as “free” money for religious charities has now turned into an aggressive intolerance of the very mission, character and purpose of these charities.
If Christian schools, hospitals, orphanages, adoption agencies and summer camps had not become dependent on money coerced from citizens through high rates of taxation, then government would not be in a position to violate fundamental Charter freedoms by distributing grant money on the basis of holding to the “correct” beliefs about life’s ultimate questions.
A government that has the power to provide everything for you also has the power to take everything away from you. In other words, were it not for big government, Christian summer camps would be able to receive more donations from citizens, who would be able to give more because they pay less tax. In a low-tax, small-government country, Christian charities could teach and promote the doctrines of their choice, without needing government approval.

On Thursday, the leader of the Bloc Yves-François Blanchet posted a tweet expressing his government’s opposition to oil pipelines, while also posting a photo, in which a bag of money with Quebec’s Fleur de Lys on it went through a pipeline.
The accompanying text stated, “14 billion for a pipeline in the west” in French.
Ce sera non. Nous avons été clairs et le gouvernement n’aura que lui-même à blâmer.

By placing a bag with Quebec’s Flur De Lys being dropped into a Canadian pipeline, alongside the number 14 billion, it appears the Bloc is attempting to put forward the message that Quebec paid for the entire pipeline when in reality it paid for a portion.
Blanchett’s complaining over Quebec cost-share on natural resource development didn’t go unnoticed by Conservative MPs from out west such as (Calgary Nose Hill) Michelle Rempel Garner.

Quebec has received nearly $14 billion in equalization payments from Canada, largely through funds brought in through oil prodcution in the west. In one year, the province received multiple times more than the portion it paid of the $14 billion used to develop TMX.
According to Alberta Premier Kenney, since inception in 1957 of equalization payments, “Quebec has received equalization money every year of the program, totalling $221 billion or 51 percent of all payments.”
In 2018, Quebec received $11.7 billion of the total $19-billion federal program funds, which is the largest of all transfers to the provinces and territories. Quebec’s annual expenditures in 2018 were $108,693,000,000.
Transfer payments made up more than 10 cents on every dollar spent in Quebec.
While projecting a surplus, Quebec will continue to also receive the most from equalization payments in the 2019-2020 fiscal year."

Thankfully a venue has stepped up and is allowing the talk entitled “#GIDYVR: How Media Bias Shapes the Gender Identity Debate” to take place on the originally scheduled date.  The new venue will remain a secret until tomorrow, but ticket holders will be notified in advance.
The Post Millennial reached out to Meghan Murphy who spoke on behalf of the organizers: “Our sponsor for the room booking pulled out last minute, leaving us without enough time to push SFU to keep the booking, from a legal standpoint, and we were forced to seek out another venue.”
The original venue was cancelled as a result of threats of violence from a group called the Coalition Against Trans Antagonism (CATA) whose members were advocating for direct action and property damage.
Murphy went on to say, “Sometimes these things are blessings in disguise, though, and #GIDYVR managed to secure another venue nearby, that is even bigger, so we are very excited to be able to open up ticket sales again! We will be keeping the venue a secret until tomorrow, but will let all ticket holders know in advance. It is unacceptable to allow those who resort to bullying and violent threats to control discourse. We will not back down, we will not be silenced, and we will not be cancelled.”"

Money from foreign countries—particularly the U.S.—is pouring into Canada, and being used to generate opposition to Canadian pipelines and Canadian energy.
Some within our country have—in part because of the influence of that foreign money—been convinced that by fighting against Canadians in the energy sector, they are somehow saving the planet.
Of course, that’s not the case.
In fact, the real, practical outcome of their efforts is simply to divert money away from Canadians and send it to foreign countries instead.
For example, the move by Encana to change their name, leave Canada, and become a U.S. company will have absolutely zero impact on emissions or oil usage. All it will do is divert investment away from Canada into the United States.
So, Canada becomes poorer over time, while the US gets richer.
It’s the same for every announcement of a company leaving our country to seek better prospects in the energy industries of foreign nations: Zero impact on emissions, no benefit to the environment, and a diversion of money, jobs, and opportunity away from Canada and towards foreign countries.
Either Canadians will get rich off oil, or foreign countries will.
In fact, when I say there’s no impact on the environment, I’m actually being overly generous.
The reality is that by diverting production away from Canada—where our energy sector has some of the most stringent and closely adhered-to environment protection programs—the net impact on the environment is quite terrible because production goes to countries that don’t care about the environment the same way Canada does.
So, the sum total of the efforts of those who fight against Canada’s energy industry is to take livelihoods away from Canadians, push investment out of our country, deprive the entire nation of financial resources that go towards social programs, make the environment worse, and divide our nation, putting it at risk of breaking up.
Now, doesn’t that sound like a foreign-funded effort to weaken, impoverish, and destabilize our country?
Why should Canada put up with it?
Why should Albertans—who are being asked to keep on giving billions every year through equalization while having their energy industry stomped out by the federal government—put up with it?
How can we call ourselves a serious country when we are not only refusing to stop foreign interests from screwing us over but—through the actions of the federal Liberals and some provincial political parties—actively colluding with those interests in the weakening and destabilization of our own country.
The reality we face is that things that can’t continue don’t continue. And unless Canada quickly figures out that we must stop allowing foreign interests to turn us against our own energy sector, this country is in serious, perhaps existential trouble."

But are they responding to actual evidence of climate change, or the constant harangues at them by Chicken Little politicians and cultural influencers desperate to prove their Gaia-reverent, politically correct credentials?
My own skepticism is buttressed when, for example, I see the Obama family purchasing a $15 million home on Martha’s Vineyard, a short walk from the beach. Obama is a huge climate alarmist. Does he or doesn’t he believe that sea levels are rising at a hugely accelerated rate because of climate change?
And if he does, why is he paying top dollar to get it? Shouldn’t it be a buyer’s market, if all the well-educated, sincerely environmentally-conscious people who own homes there believe the “consensus” view of a multiple-foot rise within 50-80 years, which would effectively finish off posh islands like Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket? In normal crises affecting threatened regions, real estate prices tumble. Instead, coastal property prices everywhere are stable or rising.
In another, much more convincing sign of the gap between rhetoric and action, the Government Accountability Institute undertook a yearlong study of 40 coastal cities, such as New York and New Orleans and San Francisco, whose waterfront areas and historic neighbourhoods would be severely affected or lost by rising oceans, and whose political leaders publicly concur with the alarmist narrative.
The question the researchers sought to answer was: “[W]hen [politicians] authorize selling municipal bonds to pay for local development, do they mention any of these risks to investors?” Financial officials—unlike party leaders on campaign trails—are legally obligated to disclose all significant risks to the value of the bonds.
The researchers found that the risk of the city being swamped by ocean water was all too often not disclosed. The study looked at 100 bond issues, mostly of the GO type (General Obligation)—that is, not specifically tied to one particular revenue source, but priced and issued based on the future economic prospects of the city’s overall tax base. They chose 100 of these issuances for 20 high-risk coastal cities, and also 100 issuances for 20 low-risk inland cities such as Chicago and Kansas City.
Greater risk is supposed to produce a higher bond interest rate, or “coupon rate.” The average bond maturity for the at-risk sample was 17.95 years; for the no-risk sample it was 17.09 years. Seventeen years from now—2036— sea level rise should, according to alarmists, be producing consequences for coastal cities that should affect the risk of these bonds, which should, therefore, be returning a significantly higher rate of interest.
The study also examined the official statements concerning each bond issue. “These documents are issued by the city and its agents to explain the purposes and risk factors of the bonds and describe the city’s financial outlook, future prospects” and so forth.
But after compiling the 200 bond issuances, the study found “no statistically significant difference between the coupon rate offered by at-risk cities and the coupon rates for the no-risk cities.”
This does not square at all with previous pronouncements of politicians in coastal cities. New York’s Bill de Blasio, for example, has said climate change is a “dagger aimed straight at the heart” of his city. In statements of claim against ExxonMobil, Chevron and other oil companies by the City of Oakland, the City of San Francisco and San Mateo County, the plaintiffs stated that the threats of rising sea levels were so ominous that “by 2050, a ‘100-year flood’ in the Oakland vicinity is expected to occur…and by 2100…once per week.” These floods would threaten Oakland’s sewer system and property and might cost the city as much as $38 billion dollars to manage.
But lo! In their risk statement to investors, New York and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey include only passing references to climate change or sea levels. And Oakland’s 2017 bonds document states, “The City is unable to predict when seismic events, fires or other natural events, such as sea rise or other impacts of climate change or flooding from a major storm, could occur, when they may occur, and, if any such events occur, whether they will have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial condition of the City or the local economy.”
San Mateo County offers a similar scenario, and similar wording in its statement, as did Boston, San Francisco, Marin County and the City of Imperial Beach. The cities of Miami and Boston both have mayors that invoke the menace of climate change to their cities when they are seeking grants from the federal government, but neither mayor took his alleged fears into consideration when issuing permits for flood-susceptible areas.
In fact, the study looked at 4,361 pages of official documents for the 20 at-risk cities, scanning for words like “sea-level rise,” “flood,” “climate change” and even “global warming.” They found fewer than 100 relevant mentions in all those pages and, in fact, “twelve of the cities did not mention any of the terms even once in such a context.”
The bottom line is that either truths are being concealed in the issuance of bonds in these cities—a very grave offence—or lies are being promulgated in the alarmist narratives spouted by the mayors when there is no price to pay for dishonesty, and grants from government or payouts from oil companies to be had for exaggerations. I know which scenario makes the most sense to me."

Now, our military is being used as a propaganda prop by communist China.
The world military games are currently taking place in Beijing.
And Canada—despite the horrific treatment of kidnapped Canadians Michael Kovrig & Michael Spavor—is participating.
The decision to have Canada participate was made by the Trudeau Liberal government, and now China is using that decision to score a huge propaganda win.
As the Globe and Mail reported, “Beijing’s embassy in Canada says the fact the Canadian military just sent a ‘big delegation’ to a sporting competition in China is more evidence the Asian power is not losing friends.”
“‘More and more countries commend China’s foreign policy and development path. China’s friends are all over the world. This is a fact that can neither be obliterated nor changed by some people’s groundless accusations,’ the Chinese embassy said.”
China also specifically mentioned Canada’s participation as “evidence” that they are gaining support on the world stage.
Canada is now a junior partner to communist China’s propaganda.
Notably, China’s embrace of Canada’s support hasn’t actually gotten our country anything, as Kovrig and Spavor are still detained, and many of our exports are still blocked.
So, Canada has received zero benefit here.
And worst of all, our already totally underfunded and under-equipped military is being used as a prop to burnish the reputation of a brutal authoritarian Communist State.
Just great…
This is humiliating for Canada and is yet another example of the Trudeau government and Canada’s governing elites showing sickening and pathetic weakness on the world stage—particularly towards China.
In an attempt to be “nice” and “go along to get along,” the government is spitting all over our values as a nation, and is sending the clear message that we can be treated like garbage without any retaliation or strong response.
And now, an even worse message is being sent:
Canada can be treated like trash and we’ll still go to your events, boost your image, and help you improve your reputation at our expense.
This may all seem fine and good to some people, but just think of what will happen when the world—already seemingly heading towards further conflict and economic strife—really breaks down.
The weak will be targeted and taken advantage of, and right now Canada looks dangerously weak—especially in the eyes of the world’s most ruthless nations.
Unless that perception changes quickly, the Canadian people will pay a very serious price for how we are seen on the world stage.
And no amount of being “nice” will change that fundamental truth."

But now that the election is over, Ford is back in Queen’s Park and he’s already starting to make moves, again.
“I called the prime minister and offered my congratulations to the prime minister, and told him: ‘I understand politics. Let’s get down to work now,’” Ford said Monday, after a five-month recess in the Ontario legislature.
“And that’s exactly what we’re doing. We’re going to work with the federal government. We’re working with municipalities right across this province … I think it’s important for Ontario to step up. Step up, unite the country. I’ve never seen the country so divided.”
His return comes at a crucial time for Canada and the provinces, with unions across the country rising up and regional divide steadily growing.
While his return was met with some dissent, particularly from those opposing social service cuts, the response was mostly positive, and Ford received a brief standing ovation.
Resuming the fight against the federal carbon tax
One of the first issues Ford will be resuming is his court battle against the federal carbon tax, calling carbon pricing “the worst tax you could ever face.” The $30-million court battle had initially received a great deal of negative pushback; however, fighting the tax is one of the primary reasons Ford was elected in the first place.
“We’re going to continue the court challenge and we’ll see it through to its end,” Ford said. “We were elected last year on a mandate to end the province’s cap-and-trade program, which we’ve done.”
Handling teacher’s unions and union strikes
The Ford government will also be pursuing new contract deals with teacher’s unions. However, this may prove an arduous endeavour, as the Ford government will have to mitigate the potential for more union strikes which have proved a constant threat over recent months.
Two of the biggest hurdles will be negotiating average class sizes and negotiating wage increases.
Currently, Ford is pushing for an average class size of 28 (up from 22), while Education Minister Stephen Lecce is pushing for an increase to 25. Both will lower the demand for teachers, eliminating some 5,000 jobs in the process, even if the less drastic increase is opted for, according to OSSTF president Harvey Bischof.
Additionally, the province is attempting to negotiate a capped wage increase of 1 percent, while unions are pushing for more money and would like it to steadily rise consistent with inflation.
Reducing red tape around alcohol sales
Talks of reducing red tape around the sale of alcohol in corner stores dwindled during Ford’s absence but are being talked about again upon his return.
One of the barriers to pushing through retail sales of alcohol is the Beer Store’s contractual stranglehold over the industry, which could cost hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to bypass.
Last week, House leader Paul Calandra said that the push for retail alcohol sale isn’t on his “priority list right now“. However, the Ford government has made a new pitch to ease the province into retail alcohol sales by proposing that airports be allowed to sell alcohol 24 hours a day, which is “in line” with other provinces.
“We met with the airport authority who spoke to this being a need, and I think it just speaks to the general process of our government trying to be open for business,” Prabmeet Sarkaria, Ontario’s Red Tape Reduction Minister, told reports Monday. “We don’t want our consumers, whether it’s people or businesses, to be held up or held back by regulations … I think regulations are meant to improve the lives of people.”"

No, they didn’t actually do anything about it, but they sure talked about it a lot.
And while talk can obscure reality for a while, sooner or later reality always wins.
Reality came roaring back in a big way, with the recent MNP survey revealing the staggering debt burden being faced by Canadians.
As reported by Roberto Wakerell-Cruz for The Post Millennial, “Almost 50 percent of Canadians are in high amounts of debt, according to a new study that observes ‘high-leveraged’ households ahead of the forthcoming interest rate decision by the Bank of Canada.
A staggering 47 percent of respondents to a survey by the Calgary-based insolvency firm MNP say they “don’t expect to be able to cover basic living expenses over the next year” without increasing the amount of debt that they’re in, according to Bloomberg.”
Additionally, “When it came to spending money, Canadians again were in a tough position, as 48 percent of respondents said they had less than $200 remaining at month’s end after covering all living expenses and debt payments—an increase of four percent compared to the previous survey conducted in June.”
Also, since June, Canadians are down an average of $142 in terms of how much money they have left over at the end of the month.
Needless to say, these are some pretty horrible numbers.
And this raises the following question:
Where’s all that help for the middle class at?
I mean, really, the Trudeau Liberals had four years in power with a majority, and they constantly talked about helping the middle class.
But things are now far worse for middle-class Canadians, and the numbers bear that out.
The debt burden is higher, leftover money is lower, the financial cushion in case of an emergency is almost non-existent.
If the Liberals had actually been helping the middle class all along, wouldn’t there be some evidence of that “help”?
Of course, the thing is that the Liberals may have talked a lot about helping middle-class Canadians, but they did just the opposite. They raised taxes, eliminated popular tax credits, imposed a carbon tax that makes everything more expensive, and hampered the economy with excessive government regulations that slow growth and destroys opportunity.
Wealth creation and growth has been concentrated in a few elitist enclaves, leaving out the vast majority of the Canadian People.
So, all that “middle class” talk from the Liberals was simply a lie to hide their true agenda: Enriching the elites at our expense."

“This House can no longer keep this country hostage,” Johnson told MPs, adding that Parliament had become “dysfunctional”.
The vote was called on Oct. 28 for a prospective Dec. 12 election. However, the House of Commons resoundingly voted the motion down, with only 299 of 650 MPs backing Johnson’s election push, reports Politico. To trigger the snap election, Johnson needed a two-thirds majority of the vote.
“I simply do not believe that this house is capable of delivering on the priorities of the people, whether that means Brexit or anything else,” Johnson told the Commons ahead of the vote. “It is frankly time for the leader of the opposition to move his rusty Trabant from the yellow box junction where it is currently blocking progress.”
Since taking office in July, Johnson has tried a total of three times to force an election, so that he can push through with Brexit plans without MPs blocking him.
“He says he wants an election on December, but how can we trust him that he will stick to that date when we do not have legal confirmation of the extension,” opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn responded. “Quite simply I do not trust the prime minister.”
Before the vote, Johnson told MPs that “one way or another” he was going to break the current deadlock in parliament, reports the BBC.
Despite this recent failure, he says he will continue trying to force an early election."

The eighteen schools educate roughly 7,300 students, according to CBC.
Teachers have thrown their support behind the support workers. A teacher’s union has said these workers have a right to protest their current wages, which are lower than those of their counterparts in other districts. This also means that parents will have to find alternative means of care during the day.
According to Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 441 president Dean Coates, these low wages are a decades-old problem, which has negatively impacted recruitment for the district and retention problems with support worker staff.
“So, we’re overworked, postings go unfilled, no replacements because they can’t retain them, they go to the other districts,” Coates said. “So, we’re in a constant state of triage as a result of the low wages.”
Conversely, district superintendent Dave Eberwein says that the district has offered the union “everything possible under the government-directed mandate of two per cent in each of three years,” reports CBC, and that the district has looked for alternative means to boost salaries.
“There isn’t another support staff offer out there in the province that is as good as this one,” Eberwein said. “It doesn’t completely bridge the wage disparity, but this is step one of two that we’re looking at.”
Eberwein says that the lower wages for support workers in his district are a result of unions going after more benefits at the expense of worker’s wages decades ago. This has led to support worker’s earning between 30 cents and $4 per hour less than support workers in other districts.
While the district has tried to remedy the situation by increasing the wages by 6 percent over three years, there are currently no new negotiations plans. As such, it isn’t clear how long the support worker’s strike will last.
With that said, Coates is optimistic that the problem will be resolved, and that the district is working towards a solution that doesn’t open up the school board to the potential of other districts going on strike.
“I empathize with the frustration that they’re feeling. Our goal is to come to a resolution as quickly as possible,” Coates said."

The photo of the unidentified man in the ill-advised costume has already been shared over 10,000 times on the social media platform.
Everday peoplekind don’t have the privilege of being the son of a famous former prime minister, as well as the PR machine and star power that comes with that.
It looks like one Canadian could’ve used the sound advice from journalist Justin Ling this Halloween season:
Just a friendly reminder this Halloween, and I can't believe I have to say this, but going as 'the Prime Minister of Canada' is not a justification to do blackface.— Justin Ling (@Justin_Ling) October 26, 2019
Ling may have reason to be concerned. This isn’t the first instance of people dressing up as blackface Trudeau. In the waning days of the election, young protestors in Ontario used the prime minister’s “enthusiasm for costumes” as an excuse to dress up in blackface themselves.
Photo: Twitter
While Ling’s warning may at first seem unnecessary in 2019 after Trudeau was reelected despite wearing blackface at least three times in his past, these above examples show that it’s clearly not acceptable. Trudeau himself has expressed regret for doing it. However, some misguided, impressionable people are still going to follow PM Justin Trudeau’s lead."

However, he says that no job has been offered and that speculation over the possibility of his being appointed as a representative of Alberta in a federal cabinet is “silly.”
“No job has been offered, nor no job has been contemplated,” Nenshi told CTV’s Question Period in an interview aired Sunday. “Probably it’s wrong, but I am enjoying all this speculation because it’s so silly.”
Following the election, concern over Western representation in government has been steadily growing, as Conservative candidates, with the exception of one NDP candidate, swept both Alberta and Saskatchewan. This means that the Liberals lack a seat in parliament to represent either of the provinces and their interests.
Recently, Nenshi said he spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling #Wexit and separatist sentiment in Alberta “very real.”
“Of course the (Trans Mountain) pipeline has to get built, of course we need to re-examine Bill C-69 which my premier calls the No More Pipelines Bill, but is actually much more dangerous than that,” Nenshi said.
Neshi says that Bill C-69 will not only stifle the oil industry’s growth but will also make other infrastructure projects significantly more difficult in the province.
According to The Canadian Press, speculation over whether Nenshi will represent Western Canada was triggered by comments made by Trudeau following the election.
These comments came Thursday when Trudeau said he has no intention of forming a coalition government but does need to be more collaborative to bridge the regional gaps between Canadians.
Along with Nenshi, former Alberta premier Alison Redford has also been pegged as a possible Trudeau confidant and representative. In a CTV Question Period, she says that she would be happy to assist the Liberals in addressing Western representation at the federal level. However, like Nenshi, she has yet to be asked.
“I haven’t been asked. I am happy to help in any way,” she told CTV’s Question Period.
“This is something Canadians have been thinking about for a long time and I think the key is that there has to be a lot of voices at the table.”"

Clark says that the announcement came after huge municipal government review, involving more than 8,500 submissions from the public.
“We will not force amalgamation of municipalities. We will not impose cuts on municipal councils,” Clark said. “I want to make it perfectly clear: We will not be imposing these changes on our municipal partners.”
The Association of Municipalities of Ontario also tweeted out their excitement of Clark’s second announcement, which was that municipalities will be receiving more support to make the changes they see fit for their regions.

According to CBC, Clark’s review looked at 82 upper and lower municipalities across Halton, York, Durham, Waterloo, Niagara, Peel, Muskoka District, Oxford County, and the County of Simcoe.
“By continuing to listen, and by working in partnership with municipalities, we will help people and businesses across Ontario thrive,” Clark said. “Our government stands firm in its commitment to partnering with municipalities without pursuing a top-down approach.”

As part of the support promised to municipalities, Clark announced that the province of Ontario will provide an extra $125 million for the municipal modernization program, which will assist regions in their review of how they deliver social services.
Several municipal representatives have come out in support of this announcement, including Region of Waterloo Chair Karen Redmen who welcomes the “clarity and move forward,” as well as Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown."

Here is the notice of appeal we received moments ago. Looks like we’re going back to court to relitigate @AndrewLawton’s ability to cover the debate that happened three weeks ago. Here we go again… @JKuredjian @TrueNorthCentre pic.twitter.com/bcBPbGCaEi— Candice Malcolm (@CandiceMalcolm) October 25, 2019
“The Trudeau Government, in one of its very first acts after the election, is using taxpayer dollars to appeal our court victory,” writes  True North founder and senior fellow Candice Malcolm in a tweet. “A victory that allowed us to cover the election. They want to shut down independent media. We will fight back! We are lawyering up. Again.”
Press freedom won when the Federal Court ruled I could cover the debates. That doesn’t fly in Trudeau’s Canada. The government is appealing to protect its desire to ban journalists in the future. We won once and we’ll do it again. https://t.co/dBtzOklTXK— Andrew Lawton (@AndrewLawton) October 25, 2019
Lawton went through a lot over the course of election 2019.
He faced obstacles as soon as official campaigning began, being barred from the Liberal Party’s media bus and plane and having to follow along in his car, often without knowing where the bus was headed.
Then, he was prevented by security from attending public events during the campaign, had the police called on him, and was even banned from covering press conferences.
It’s official. I’ve been banned from covering Justin Trudeau’s press conference. The reason? I’m not an “accredited” journalist, through the press secretary could not provide a definition of what accreditation means in a country that doesn’t license journalists.— Andrew Lawton (@AndrewLawton) September 22, 2019
The rationale used by the Liberal team was that Lawton didn’t meet their accreditation standards, which included having to live in Ottawa for a certain amount of time, despite these standards not applying to other journalists.
Things only got worse. Finally, once the official debates began, he was the only journalist prevented from attending, with the federal election deciding that True North was an advocacy group and, thus, Lawton wasn’t an official journalist worthy of attendance.
“We believe it is illegal for the debate to be held excluding us, because we are a media organization and they’ve decided we are not, which is not true,” said Malcolm at the time.
In response, Lawton and True North brought the issue to the federal courts, demanding, based on freedom of speech and freedom of the press, as well as Lawton’s long-standing journalism career, that he be allowed to cover the election.
“The idea that they can just say, ‘no you’re not a journalist’ and come up with excuses – these people are acting like dictators, they’re acting like bullies and I don’t think they should be allowed to get away with it,” said Malcolm at the time of the lawsuit.
Ultimately, Lawton was victorious in his accreditation case, and the courts forced federal election staff to allow him to cover the election and ask questions.
Judge says that True North’s Andrew Lawton will be granted accreditation.— Candice Malcolm (@CandiceMalcolm) October 7, 2019
As it stands, the campaign against Lawton’s journalistic freedoms will continue indefinitely, with more taxpayer money being spent in a legal battle to keep a journalist from doing his job."

The Trudeau Liberals effectively used fear in the last federal election, and—in combination with an anemic Conservative campaign and a compliant establishment media—managed to demonize Scheer enough in Ontario and Quebec to hold onto power.
And fear has been even more successful for the Quebec separatist movement.
While the separatists have not achieved their goal of making Quebec an independent country, the very real threat of Quebec leaving Canada and breaking up the country has given the province a massive amount of leverage.
Quebec has control over immigration, is able to impose “values-tests,” has industries heavily subsidized by the federal government, doesn’t have to fight for the right to export their products, receives a tremendous amount of equalization money (much of it from Alberta), and is able to pass legislation (Bill-21) that would be massively demonized if it came from any other province.
In short, by having a credible threat of breaking up the country on the table, Quebec has managed to improve their financial power and political independence dramatically.
Threatening to break up Canada is a strategy, and for Quebec, it’s a strategy that has worked.
Of course, this is all quite sad to admit, since it points to a deeper problem that Canada has. If we are at the point in which provincial nationalism is superseding federal nationalism, and if our country is now a place in which provinces feel they need to use threats to national unity to be heard by the central government, then we are already on the brink.
That said, it’s simply a reality that successful strategies get copied by others.
That how human beings learn, we look at what has worked for others, and seek to apply that to our own situation, especially when all the other options seem to have exhausted themselves.
So, for a growing number of people in Western Canada—particularly in Alberta—a look at how Quebec has used the threat of separation leads to the conclusion that utilizing those same threats in Alberta is likely to succeed (success being defined in having the province’s demands met). And it’s no surprise that with more people reaching that conclusion, support for separation, or at least the use of the threat of separation as a leverage tool, is growing.
I don’t want to see Alberta separate. And I don’t want to see Quebec separate. Canada is a beautiful nation, with perhaps more potential than any other country. But that potential is being squandered by a failing federal government, and bunch of corrupt elites who have demonized Canadian federal nationalism, and screwed over the energy industry, thus setting the stage for tribalism and provincial nationalism to surge out of control.
If Alberta’s concerns are not addressed, if Albertans are not treated with the respect they deserve and have earned, and if the federation doesn’t work for ALL Canadians, then nobody should be surprised to see more and more people look to the example of Quebec’s strategy for influence."

Government funding went towards publication of this ""Muslim Voting Guide"" by Wilfrid Laurier University's Canadian Islamophobia Industry Research Project. The document's stated purpose was to steer Muslims' votes. Government funding to win votes. https://t.co/xyjRItoUVD— Andrew Lawton (@AndrewLawton) October 25, 2019
The “Canadian Muslim Voting Guide: Federal Election 2019” was released roughly three days before the federal election, on October 18th.
The guide’s preparation page shows its funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), a federal agency.
From one of the pages
Shockingly, the guide lists six issues as deeply important to Muslims, and grades each leader qualitatively.
The alt-right and Islamaphobia, M103, religious freedoms in Quebec (Bill 21), immigration and refugees, the BDS movement and foreign policy.
The grading is incredibly vague and some of them are misleading.
According to the guide, “the criteria used to determine these grades has been based on whether a party leader’s particular political standpoints and/or policy initiatives are positive or detrimental to the interests of Canadian Muslims and the wider geopolitical concerns that affect Muslims globally.”
Oddly, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was graded an “F” on immigration and alt-right groups despite there being no evidence he supports extremists groups (he’s actually condemned them) and his immigration platform was very similar to that of the Liberals. Meanwhile, the government’s own internal polling showed the majority of Canadians are not pleased with Trudeau’s lax attitude toward the open border, yet still received a passing grade.
While aiming to “inform” Muslim voters, the guide appears to fall short on multiple instances with the most important being the lack of information behind how these six issues became the most important to Canadian Muslims or how exactly these grades were determined. Where data was used, it appears it was top-line, involving polls of the general population rather than of actual Muslims.
Understandably, Quebec’s Bill 21 was included an issue, but where were the other issues that matter even more such as economic integration, climate change, or housing prices?
Muslims by the nature of being Muslims do not stop being everyday citizens. The issues that matter to Canadians in many cases also matter to us with perhaps a caveat here or there.
The research did not just ignore key issues like the economy, it also poorly explained the ones it set out to talk about such as how Muslims experience hate.
The guide interestingly ignores left-wing extremism but focuses on the alt-right, seemingly forgetting that Quebec Solidaire supported Bill 21, and communism at its core rejects all religions.
While the lack of information on key issues is problematic, the number of enemies the guide creates is perhaps the most worrying for both the government and Muslims in Canada.
Within its pages, the guide brings BDS forward as a top-six issue, while also claiming that Zionist and Christian ideologies were fomenting hate against Muslims.
Both of these claims are serious problems as they create division between Muslims and other religious groups while also creating an image where Canadian Muslims stand in clear contrast with virtually every party in the country.
In 2016, the House overwhelmingly voted to condemn BDS, as well as “all attempts by Canadian organizations, groups or individuals to promote the BDS Movement, both here at home and abroad.”
With so much controversy you’d imagine at least some level of polling would be done to determine how Canadian Muslims stood on this issue.
None was found in the report.
Following the release of the report, multiple Jewish groups voiced serious concern regarding the inclusion of  government funds with a guide that involves support for “anti-Semitic BDS.”
We have become aware of a document entitled “Canadian Muslim Voting Guide: Federal Election 2019” that includes Pass-Fail grades for Federal Party leaders around a series of issues, including support for the antisemitic BDS movement.

The Liberals held onto the government, the Conservatives won the popular vote, and both the Bloc and the Green party increased their number of seats.
Singh, for all his last-minute showmanship, was only able to secure 15% of the vote, bringing with it half as many seats as the party was able to win in 2015 under Thomas Mulcair.
In Quebec, the previous home to the massive 2011 Orange wave, only Alexandre Boulerice returned to the house of commons as an NDP MP.
Everyone else, including Ruth Ellen Brosseau, lost their seats.
To secure that pitiful share of the vote, Singh leveraged the NDP, running a crusade the party could not afford. Today, the Layton building remains re-mortgaged, and the party’s coffers appear destitute.
While some NDP partisans have been quick to celebrate their defeat blindly, the truth of 2019 is that the Layton wave is now gone.
In its place, the party has mostly become a BC and Ontario based organization, with nearly all of the NDP’s MPs hailing from those two regions.
Based on the campaign the NDP ran, its no wonder those are the results.
The party opposed the Trans Mountain pipeline arguing the environmental damage would be too much while supporting projects like the BC LNG.
The LNG project they support has been described as a ‘carbon bomb,’ by some.
The argument for supporting the plan comes from the idea that it is a safer and cleaner alternative to the coal energy used in China.
While true, this idea follows the same train of thought behind building a pipeline.
With all things considered, a pipeline will be cheaper and safer than conventional rail, according to a report from the Fraser Institute.
Due to Canada’s carbon tax, efficiencies gained here would be used to help deal with the problems of climate change.
This bizarre opposition to one “dirty” project while remaining open to another, lacked certainty and perhaps worse of all appear to show Singh’s campaign as both hypocritical and unready to lead a federal nation.
Of course, Trans Mountain and LNG were just a portion of the problem.
For a party like the NDP, the biggest failure came from the campaign’s inability to stake out strong positions even on policies such as bill 21, where they stood to gain from in every respect.
Here they allowed for an almost cartoon-like moment to occur during Canada’s only English debate to feature all major party leaders, where Trudeau days after a multi-part blackface scandal as able to look like the defender of Canada’s minority rights.
No wonder seats fell by the wayside in Quebec and failed to materialize in minority-dominated areas across the country.
While relegated to a portion of their previous base, the NDP still has a potential path to victory. It just won’t be easy.
Under Mulcair and then Singh, the party failed to repeat 2011, yet they remain Canada’s third party, and by extension, the progressive rival to the Liberals, a feat the Greens failed to pull from Singh’s hands.
With the Liberals providing an array of failed progressive promises such as electoral reform or their continued willingness to provide extra attention to Quebec, the NDP could have a way to strip Liberal voters, especially if Elizabeth May’s replacement turns into a dud.
That path just won’t be like 2011, and after two failed attempts, perhaps its best that dream was allowed to die, especially with Singh as the leader. Instead, the party will have to focus on building a new movement that places it as a deceive and distinct progressive alternative for working-class Canadians.

That means having a clear campaign that manages to bring together the BC and Ontario core and expands on it through clear and direct policy put through from day one, something isn’t a hodgepodge of random ideas, but rather a clear vision for Canada that can be decisively described as all NDP.
While the party failed to materialize on their dreams in 2019, Singh will likely get another chance to lead his party in the following election.
Hopefully, he takes the chance and rebuilds the NDP into what it deserves to be, Canada’s real progressive alternative."

To achieve this, Tedio says that it is necessary to eliminate all public funding to a separate Catholic school board.
“For students, this change means the convenience of attending their closest school, less time on the bus and access to an optional religious curriculum,” Tedjo said Thursday.
“For teachers and early childhood educators, it means smaller class sizes, availability of more resources and the freedom to teach in any publicly funded school.”
Despite being Catholic himself, Tedjo says his move makes fiscal sense and that it’s necessary to have all four school boards merged into secular French and English schools.
“As a Catholic, I have a choice, but others don’t have that choice.”
Tedjo says that by merging Catholic school boards with the public, Ontario could save between $1.2 and $1.6 billion, citing a 2012 Federation of Urban Neighbourhoods study.
Tedjo has entitled his plan “Learning Together,” and has drawn inspiration from Quebec, Manitoba, and Newfoundland which have done the same.
“For students, this change means the convenience of attending their closest school, less time on the bus and access to an optional religious curriculum. For teachers and early childhood educators, it means smaller class sizes, availability of more resources and the freedom to teach in any publicly funded school,” said Tedjo in a news release.
“Learning Together would also see more class offerings in STEM and the arts, as well as improved mental health resources and supports for students with special needs.”
Despite the controversy, and the fact Tedjo has three children enrolled in Catholic education right now, he says that Learning Together will allow the merged school board to incorporate the strengths of both and provide a better education and school experience for all kids in the province."
0,2019-10-25T06:33:43.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/will-trudeau-continue-to-be-a-coward-about-china,Will Trudeau continue to be a coward about China?,"During his recent press conference following his election win, Justin Trudeau was asked about dealing with Communist China, including efforts to free Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and whether he would take any retaliatory measures.
As usual, Trudeau passed up the opportunity to show strength, and failed to bring Canadians together in opposition to Communist China.
Instead, he uttered a bunch of empty platitudes which meant nothing.
Again and again, Trudeau shows total cowardice towards Communist China, and it appears that is set to continue.
The recent federal election would have been an opportunity to apply pressure to the federal leaders on China, but Trudeau skipped the foreign policy debate, and the Conservatives—despite having tougher policies towards China—didn’t make it much of an issue, and didn’t seize the opportunity to take on the “Captain Canada” mantle.
As a result, there has been no marshalling of Canadian public opinion in opposition towards China, no added pressure for our Citizens to be freed, and no retaliation.
The consequence of this—and the apparent continuation of Trudeau’s cowardly approach—is that China, and other potential opponents of our country, will be further emboldened to mistreat our country.
After all, China has been able to get away with their mistreatment of our country while facing no consequences from Canada. The government hasn’t even banned Huawei, which would be among the simplest of things they could do to send a message.
So, why would China or anyone else think twice before treating our country like garbage?
Contrast this to the US, where Mike Pence just gave a speech that slammed China, and ripped US companies that are subservient to the Communist State. The Trump Administration has—whether you like the other things they do or not – been far tougher on China than any Western government in decades.
And for those who argue that Canada doesn’t have the “size” to push back against China, the reality is that our economy is not dependent on trading with China, and a combination of government assistance for producers, expanded interprovincial trade, and trade deals with new markets could soften any blow that comes from decoupling or distancing our economy from the authoritarian Communist State.
But none of that will happen until Trudeau shows some guts and courage, and until the opposition is willing to make China a big deal with the Canadian people.
In other words, don’t hold your breath."

Caroline Cochrane, former cabinet minister in outgoing Premier Robert McLeod’s government, was elected on Thursday after three rounds of secret ballot by 19 MLA-elects.
These MLAs were winners in the general election held more than three weeks ago on October 1st, chosen by the territory’s voting-age residents among 44,826 people in 33 communities, scattered across 1.3 million square km.
Like Nunavut, Northwest Territories operates a consensus style government without political parties.
After the vote, MLA-elects caucus and choose a leader by secret ballot, followed by a cabinet of six – those not selected in this process then sit as opposition to premier and cabinet.
Cochrane was not immediately available for comment, but in a speech following her election said her policy is “to always have an open door”.
In a wide-ranging interview with Yellowknife’s Cabin Radio before the election, Cochrane spoke of “diversifying” an economy underpinned by government and abundant natural resources, development of which is prone to boom-and-bust commodities cycles.
The territory is also over-layed with multiple self-governing Indigenous authorities – some nascent, others more mature and still others locked in treaty negotiations with Ottawa.
A process to devolve management of land, resources and royalty rights from Ottawa, to the territorial government and Indigenous groups remains ongoing, but received more certainty in 2014 with Royal Assent of Bill C-15, or the Northwest Territories Lands and Resources Devolution Agreement.
During Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s previous government, then-Premier McLeod butted heads with Ottawa over resource management in the NWT after the PM unilaterally closed offshore drilling in the Beaufort Sea in 2016.
In a statement issued following NWT’s selection for premier, Trudeau thanked McLeod for his service and congratulated Cochrane “on being chosen by her peers to lead the Government of the Northwest Territories.”
“I look forward to working closely with Premier Cochrane and the Government of the Northwest Territories to address the needs and priorities of Northerners,” said Trudeau."

“They’re not interested in helping the rest of Canada trying to drive an economic future with resources that we have while were using them,” said Higgs on television.
The comments came after Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-François Blanchet said his party will fight to prevent any pipeline from being developed in the province.
Higgs pointed out that this position is inconcsistent with Quebec’s energy projects which include selling electricity to the rest of Canada and a natural gas pipeline.

“I can tell you it is not in our plans at all to form any sort of formal coalition,” Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa of Liberal’s post election strategy in keeping the confidence of the house.
The prime minister said he would unveil his new cabinet on November 20.
Trudeau said “affordability and “climate change” are issues that would garner support from opposition parties, even the separatist Bloc who surged to 32 seats, or more than 40 percent of the MPs from that province who will occupy a place in the new parliament.
Faced with separatist inclinations on either side of the country, ballot box sentiments that translated into political enclaves coast-to-coast, and now #WEXIT echoing throughout social media, Trudeau was blitzed with questions about Canadian unity.
“I expect Premiers Kenney and Moe and all Premiers to stand up for the interests of their citizens. That’s their job,” said Trudeau about the discord between Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe.
Both have attacked Trudeau, Moe most recently for “dividing the nation” over lack of new pipelines to tidewater under a Liberal first-term government, and continue to stand in defiance of Trudeau’s carbon tax.
“People in Alberta and Saskatchewan have been suffering and struggling because of circumstances beyond their control,” Trudeau acknowledged, blaming sagging energy markets rather than the uncertainty his government is criticized for creating.
Trudeau also said he had a “cordial conversation” with Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose government is also fighting the federal carbon tax in court, and was cast as Conservative bogeyman by the Liberal war room planners.
The Prime Minister also tried to balance “fighting climate change” with green lighting TMX; a position environmentalists have said is hypocritical.
“We need to get our resources to markets other than the United States in a safe and secure way,” said Trudeau. “And that’s what the Trans Mountain Pipeline will do, and then we will be able to invest all profits and revenues into this green energy and fighting climate change that Canadians expect us to have done.”
Considering the magnitude of the SNC-Lavalin scandal and its resultant fallout for Trudeau, who turfed the former-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould from the Liberal Party for spilling the beans (she won as an independent and will remain a thorn in Trudeau’s side), there were no questions on this subject.
On day 317 of China’s detention of Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig – arrested and charged with spying by the communist regime in retaliation for our arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou – Trudeau said he received  a briefing”from our National Security and Intelligence Advisor, who addressed these issues and others.”

Asked if he would get tougher with China, given the ongoing detention, agriculture embargoes and with Hong Kong political tensions spilling into Canadian streets, the Prime Minister would not say.
“Obviously, through this election campaign, I have continued to keep an eye on the situation around the world, including the difficult situation these two Canadians who have been arbitrarily detained are facing,” said Trudeau who noted Canadians living in Hong Kong “and the concerns that we have around respect for human rights and a de-escalation there.”

Kay dismissed my charge that the employees at the CBC are generally in the tank for Trudeau’s Liberals. He said it was nonsense because many at the public broadcaster are NDP supporters, too.
I countered that more left-wing individuals at the CBC inevitably get in line when push comes to shove. Even Dippers within CBC’s ranks come to the aid of Trudeau in his times of need in order to keep the Conservatives out of power, even if that means sacrificing their own party’s gains.
(It’s the same reason why NDP think tank Broadbent Institute’s Press Progress predominantly attacks Conservatives, despite Liberals being a much greater challenge to the NDP’s success. Furthermore, CBC attacks The Post Millennial for Conservative pamphleteering, the public broadcaster has cited Press Progress‘s work without questioning the source.)
I know this is the case because I can still distinctly remember the election bias from the last campaign in 2015. That was when I first started writing about politics while teaching English overseas. One of the first pieces I ever wrote–and the first to get thousands of visitors to my makeshift website–was entitled “CBC’s Insolent Election Bias,” in which I documented the absurd in-your-face bias the supposed public broadcaster displayed for Trudeau throughout that election.
But the CBC outdid itself this time around.
The little Twitter tiff between Kay and I ended with me saying he would eat his words come election season. And boy was I right.

The CBC’s koolaid drinking for Trudeau started right out of the gate during the leadup to the election being officially called.
When the Toronto Star–now also a beneficiary of millions of taxpayer’s money courtesy of the Liberal government’s $600 million bailout of political journalism, not including the CBC–dropped a so-called exclusive of Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s comments in the House of Commons about gay marriage from over a decade ago the CBC ran hard with the story as if it were breaking news.
That, as well as Scheer’s own personal views on abortion, were hot topics of conversation the CBC would belabour about for days on end, despite the CPC leader making it clear these issues were not going to be touched by a Conservative government (they’d be political suicide anyway). All the while CBC ignored Trudeau’s own statements to the CBC in 2011 that he himself is personally pro-life (days later, when some reporter finally got around to trying to show some semblance of balance, Trudeau was asked about it and said he had changed his views).
As the CBC incessantly went on about SoCon issues that would not get any attention in Ottawa if the CPC won, it downplayed real issues like national debt, the SNC-Lavalin scandal and graft.
When Trudeau was found to have worn blackface on three separate occasions because a private citizen decided to provide Time magazine with a copy of a yearbook that Trudeau was in charge of overseeing and that included a picture of him in blackface, the CBC decided it was a good idea to harass the individual who drew the public’s attention to Trudeau’s poor decision when he was 29. CBC essentially was sending a message to anyone else with damaging information on the incumbent PM: Stay quiet.
The Vancouver man who released the photo of Justin Trudeau in blackface at a party says the ""Canadian public had the right to know"" about it.

And why would CBC have such a fealty for Trudeau? His increasing of the state broadcaster’s annual $1.1 billion federal subsidy once assuming power might have something to do with it. Trudeau shamelessly reminded CBC employees who butters their bread by giving its senior political reporter David Cochrane free poutine on the campaign trail in September while saying, “The Liberal Party always supports the CBC.”
“The Liberal Party always supports the CBC,” Justin Trudeau jokes as he gives a CBC journalist an order of poutine while on the campaign trail Monday.

Even though Cochrane should’ve followed CBC’s Journalistic Standards and Practices and declined the poutine in order to avoid a “real or perceived” conflicts of interest, the symbolism of him smilingly while taking the poutine from Trudeau spoke volumes.
Speaking of conflicts of interest, somehow CBC management and journalists John Paul Tasker and Rosemary Barton thought it was perfectly acceptable for them to single out the CPC for a copyright suit, meanwhile ignoring other parties and Liberals’ use of CBC material. All the more obvious it was a political decision to go after CPC was the fact that copyright lawyers and professors were in agreement with the party’s use of CBC material fell well within fair dealing.
As the CBC’s boneheaded decision to file a lawsuit with not just the broadcaster as a plaintiff, but both Barton and Tasker blew up in their faces, the silence and mealy-mouthed non-answers raised more questions than answers.
CBC hired top lawyers, so it’s hard to imagine that they would’ve been negligent enough to not get the permission of Barton and Tasker to include them as applicants in the lawsuit. Neither the two journalists nor the CBC have clarified if the journalists were involved in the lawsuit. But it is noteworthy Barton’s mentor and predecessor Peter Mansbridge requested management get the CBC to sue the CPC during last election for using a clip from one of his interviews with Trudeau in which the party used the Liberal leader’s nonsensical answer about the Boston Bombing. Did Barton take a page out Mansbridge’s playbook? An Access to Information request for the internal communications regarding the latest lawsuit will hopefully get to the bottom of it.
At the very least Barton should’ve been pulled as one of the four hosts of The National while her name was still on the lawsuit, but instead, she continued and was the lead host of their election coverage, where many Conservative observers again noted her bias for the Liberals.
But it wasn’t just the credibility of Barton, Tasker and Cochrane that were put into serious question this election. Other CBC senior reporters covering federal politics also showed favouritism towards the Liberals.
CBC Ottawa reporter Katie Simpson wrote a piece the day before the vote in which her piece—filed under news—claiming a big “momentum shift” for the CPC campaign in which she suggested things were going badly in the last two days of the campaign.  The article had to be corrected because Simpson cut part of a Scheer quote where he said the Liberals would have to raise the GST “or cut completely the Canada Social Transfer to the provinces.” Only after a complaint was filed did CBC clarify that Scheer wasn’t saying necessarily the GST would be raised, but that something would have to give.
I've lodged an official complaint to @CBC about your colleague truncating the Scheer/GST quote. Regrettable to see you re-tweeting it #cdnmedia #cdnpoli #elxn43 https://t.co/eKG7cq4Pyp— Norman Spector (@nspector4) October 20, 2019
CBC journalists, including Barton and Simpson, claimed that Scheer was being dishonest by claiming Trudeau would have to raise the GST at some point because Trudeau said he wouldn’t, as if Trudeau’s word as is good as gold. It’s not like he followed through on his promise to balance the books by 2019 and only run small deficits. What made it all the more hypocritical is these same journalists speculated for days on Scheer’s personal pro-life views even though he said it wouldn’t be an issue touched in office. It’s almost as if these journalists are acting in bad faith.
Simpson’s and her colleagues nitpicking of Scheer while giving Trudeau a pass on much larger issues was commonplace throughout the campaign. But for an apples to apples contrast, Simpson noted on Twitter that Scheer tripped and almost fell at one point near the end of the campaign and thought it was caught on camera. It wasn’t, but Trudeau was caught on camera tripping around the same time and she ignored it.

Similar to Simpson, CBC’s Aaron Wherry wrote multiple opinionated articles under “analysis”. One of his articles falsely claimed the B.C. carbon tax was revenue neutral and remained incorrect for hours, misinforming (disinforming?) Canadians. It’s no secret Wherry’s political views align with the Liberals. He was given unprecedented access to the PM to write a varnished biography (hagiography?) of Trudeau’s first term in office.
What is all the more galling is how CBC seems to have decided to just embrace its overt bias towards the Liberals. Near the tail end of the campaign, after CBC had already severely tarnished its brand, it thought it was a good idea to hire washed up sock puppet Ed the Sock to help “comedy” show 22 Minutes despite even left-wing journalists noticing he is one of the biggest Trudeau apologists on Twitter. It makes sense though when you see that the lead comedian on the show, Mark Critch, is more of Trudeau’s court jester than biting satirist.
Before ending this column, one more anecdote. I wrote several columns for the CBC a few years ago after I challenged the former opinion section editor on his claim the new platform was going to have a diversity opinion. The editor offered me an opportunity to write on a freelance basis and as it was the start of my freelance career I figured it would be stupid to pass up even if I was against the CBC.
My columns were quite successful on the CBC website, with many commenters shocked these opinions were published by the CBC because they went against the left-wing orthodoxy at the broadcaster. But I decided to stop contributing to the CBC when I wrote a column against of the proposal of the Green Party in B.C. and a Liberal MPP in Ontario to lower the voting age to 16 in those jurisdictions (CBC news coverage on the proposal was overwhelmingly positive). I didn’t reach out to any of the politicians promoting lowering the voting age because it was an opinion piece, but somehow while I was revising the piece the Liberal MPP in Ontario randomly liked one of my tweets. After my second set of revisions were made my editor decided to kill the piece.
It was at this point I decided to pack it in and stop being a useful tool for the CBC to claim it actually has a diversity of opinions that accurately reflect the Canadian public.
“I’m a big proponent of lowering the voting age to 16,” said @rickmercer. To those who argue 16-year-olds’ brains aren’t fully formed he said, “I would argue, you could say the same about half of the House of Commons.” #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/0rRvsZz8O9— Power & Politics (@PnPCBC) October 18, 2019
It’s almost as if Canada needs CBC whistleblowers to expose the political bias and nepotism within the state broadcaster—as just happened to CNN in the U.S.—to reveal just how in the tank its journalists are for the Liberals.

“It’s extremely important that the government works for all Canadians, and as I have endeavoured to do over the past years and as I will do even more now, deliberately, I will be reaching out to leaders across the country, reaching out specifically to westerners to hear from them,” he said.
Following a short 30 second statement, Trudeau delved into a roughly 30-minute long question and answer which largely revolved around the currently divided state of the nation.
This has become a larger issue as while the Liberals did win the largest number of seats, forming a minority government, they lost the popular vote to the Conservatives.
The Liberal party leader was also asked if he would work with the Bloc, to which he responded that he would work with them on areas such as climate change."

Canadian pundits and politicians were more interested in the frivolity and fray of leader’s personalities and partisan irrelevancies.
Take, for instance, Andrew Scheer’s American passport, or the non-issue of abortion, which despite multiple assurances from Scheer, nevertheless, took up days of election coverage.
Having said all this, these issues were dwarfed in importance to that of Trudeau’s blackface scandal, which facilitated days of discussion, deafening any sensible discourse on legislation that could have taken its place.
So now, to contribute to this cacophony, The Post Millennial presents a round-up of the blackface scandal, including some of the best comments and jokes that followed in its wake.

The prime minister still can’t quite bring himself to remember how many times he wore blackface, so it wouldn’t be entirely eyebrow-raising if more of these photographs popped up.

Perhaps, next time, the world will take notice of Canada for reasons that don’t have to do with our prime minister’s cavalier attitude."

According to Global News, Jagmeet Singh will start campaigning for electoral reform after his party finished fourth behind the separatist Bloc Quebecois. Singh will suggest that Canada alters its electoral system from first-past-the-post (similar to the USA and the UK) to proportional representation, which significantly benefits minor national parties.
The NDP leader spoke on Tuesday, declaring that “the results [has shown] a broken electoral system and it’s certainly clear we need to fix it. I’ve long called for and will continue to call for true electoral reform.”
Jagmeet Singh’s NDP won 16 percent of the popular vote which translated into 24 seats— a disastrous showing for the social-democratic party. Alternatively, the Bloc Quebecois received 7.7 percent of the popular vote and yet managed to receive 32 seats. Through this, it is easy to empathize with Singh’s frustration.
Nevertheless, democratic countries that utilize the proportional representation system often suffer instability when forming a government. This is due to the ability of smaller parties to gain a large number of seats. In Northern Ireland, for example, a government has not been formed in two years. Likewise in Israel, the proportional representation system has led to a total failure of the leading parties to form a government, creating deep polarization amongst the electorate.
In 2015, Justin Trudeau pledged to get rid of the current first-past-the-post system due to perceived representational deficiencies. This promise, however, never materialized."

In three of the cases, Yaniv was ordered to pay $2,000 in damages each to Sandeep Banipal, Marcia DaSilva, and Sukhdip Hehar for “improper conduct.”
The details of the ruling, released in a 60-page document, includes stunning detail of the Tribunal’s decision, with Yaniv being described as “engaging in extortionate behaviour,” and “being untruthful” with details, as well as “offering evidence calculated to mislead the Tribunal.”
Most shockingly, the Tribunal recognized the reality that the majority of defendants in the case were racialized women, and documented a condemnation of Yaniv as being on a mission to “punish” certain racial groups for not “assimilating into Canadian culture.” According to the ruling documents, Yaniv allegedly attempted to explain away the volume of suits against racialized women as an unavoidable consequence of “these are the only people” who provide these aesthetic services.
The Tribunal didn’t buy it.
Speaking with the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedom’s Jay Cameron, one of the key lawyers who worked on behalf of the women pro bono, the excitement over the ruling rang through his voice.
“One of the clients I spoke with was crying. It was a very heavy weight off her shoulders—the stress, the loss of income. She was exceedingly relieved.”
Commending the Tribunal for their comprehensive ruling, Cameron discussed the details of the document released by the BCHRT.
“It became evident there was a [racial] pattern with the complaints once there was more information about them.” Cameron says, noting that the pattern wasn’t immediately clear due to the publication ban, which obscured the details from case to case. But once the individual respondents were named, all became clear. Cameron also stated that the comments made by Yaniv at the tribunal proceedings itself revealed a highly charged racial sentiment.
“Yaniv’s perception of why there was a refusal to provide a service—whether because of culture, religion, or failure to conform to Canadian social norms as Yaniv sees them.” Cameron says, “That became something obvious that we had to advance on behalf of the defendants—that there was an improper motivation for the complaints.”
The Tribunal ruling revealed that Yaniv had also used fake Facebook profiles and profile images to solicit services from the women in an attempt to present as either a biological female, or significantly more feminine and far along transition than Yaniv in fact was.
On this, Cameron says “Yaniv realized when using their ordinary physical presentation on Facebook, that the women were saying look, we don’t provide this service to men because we don’t service male genitalia,” continuing, “So to work around that, Yaniv thought to work around that I will present as something stereotypically female and then spring it on them later.”
Cameron adds that the Tribunal found it was improper and calculated to obtain sufficient evidence against a service provider to ground a human rights complaint.
While Cameron said he could not comment on whether or not he foresees Yaniv attempting to ground a complaint against him in the wake of his latest victory, he offered that the Justice Centre was a public constitutional firm that did pro bono work on public interest cases.
“The friction between self-identification and service providers, that’s of public interest. The theatrical aspects of some of the complainant’s behaviour, that’s of public interest. The Justice Centre exists by virtue of the fact that people make donations.”
While the Tribunal cases for the estheticians may have come to a close, Yaniv has already launched two additional suits… One in the BCHRT against anti-LGBT Christian activist Bill Whatcott for allegedly misgendering Yaniv, and one in the BC Civil Courts against a Vancouver-area physiotherapist after the table Yaniv had been lying on allegedly broke.
In both cases, Yaniv is seeking the maximum allowable claim of $35,000."

And the ultimate loser for this tactic, employed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his righthand man Gerald Butts (the de facto PM), who gamed most everything as an “anointed versus neanderthals, bigots and racists” issue, was the nation.
Even when Trudeau was mocked for correcting a woman at a town hall for using “mankind”, when according to our PM that henceforth it should be referred to as “peoplekind”, Butts saw Nazis everywhere.

To be sure, the identity politics and related hypocrisy on this front, by the Liberal leader himself (i.e. #TrudeauBlackface being the most egregious), hurt the party as it dropped 20 seats and lost majority government status after Monday night’s federal vote.
In the aftermath of Canada’s 43rd general election, Trudeau and the Liberals held just 157 seats – a baker’s dozen of MPs shy of majority carte blanche for another four years – while Conservatives and their leader Andrew Scheer added just 26 MPs to their caucus, falling far short of beating Trudeau.
And not since incumbent-Progressive Conservative prime minister Kim Campbell’s stunning election blowout in 1993, has the Bloc Quebecois been in position to play an influential role in a new federal government.
Then it was the Reform Party’s rise under Preston Manning, a western-centric party whose success in Alberta basically gifted then-Bloc Leader Lucien Bouchard the unlikely role leading Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition against Jean Chrétien’s Liberal majority.
Today, it’s an overcrowded left and a weakened New Democrat Party, whose third-party status was gutted after Monday’s election, much of that support likely going to new Bloc leader Yves-François Blanchet’s separatists, who won over Quebecers unimpressed with any federalist alternative.
The Bloc’s won in 32 ridings – a 22 seat boost from the last federal vote – also knocked Singh and the NDP from third party spot in the House of Commons, while the nation watched Quebec’s political pendulum swung back toward a more nationalistic, self-interest.
But this loss for Canada’s stalwart, left-wing party could hardly be detected in Singh’s rambling, congratulatory speech that sounded more like a victory address.
As ironic as the separatist Bouchard’s station in Parliament some 26 years ago, was that Singh’s losing night – New Democrats dropped 15 seats and lost official third party status – remains enough to hold the balance of power in Ottawa, by propping up Trudeau and the Liberals.
Looking West, the federation’s economic engine Alberta has turned nearly completely Conservative blue, and Saskatchewan is all blue; Quebec is again beset with a separatist insurgency, while incumbent-Trudeau’s party remains strong in the Laurentien regions; Maritimes, urban regions of Quebec, Toronto’s 416 and the Ottawa valley.
Given this result, the embattled TMX project and other moribund pipelines to get Albertan oil to tidewater, western separatism is now trending on social media via #Wexit, complete with the added vitriol that only anonymous Twitter accounts can provide; in the following instance, aimed at Newfoundland voters.
So Canada today has Albertans crapping all over Nflders. Well done @JustinTrudeau.

But vitriol is not required to divide, as Butts’ social media presence proved, and combined with anointed Liberal bromides heard through the past four years impressed upon the plebes that only they could lead us to a new era of “inclusion” and “strength in diversity”.
To see what the country looks like today – the posturing of separatists in Quebec, disaffected westerners and indigenous groups who back TMX and those who don’t – it is clear to anyone who isn’t a mushroom that there is little “inclusion” in today’s Canada, just weakness in a sea of diversity.
And even while his own party race hustled – Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen told a largely Somali crowd on Canada Day that Conservatives “danced with white supremacists” – then fielded anti-Semites like ex-activist Sameer Zuberi, Butts pretended it was only the other guys who did this sort of thing.
On October 21, Butts took particular Twitter glee after Scheer got hammered by a reporter for hiring political fixer Warren Kinsella to dig, then gin up any racist dirt he could find on Maxime Bernier and his People’s Party of Canada.
Must watch interview. ? https://t.co/770Tv63EPo— Gerald Butts ?? (@gmbutts) October 21, 2019
But the facile narratives pushed by Butts, and let’s face it, given plenty of oxygen by our establishment media, for example that “only conservatives can be racist”, was but just one Canadians have been assailed with, in increasing intensity since Trudeau took power in 2015.
Other bogus narratives pushed on the public included that it was somehow “unCanadian” to question Canada’s current open border policy loophole regarding our Safe Third Country Agreement with United States.
And this “unCanadian” line was trotted out several times, by Trudeau and his minions whilst Immigration Canada was straining under the growing backlog of asylum claims; nearly 50,000 made by people illegally entering the country from New York State.
Another classic fake narrative that predated Trudeau, but was serially employed by his Minister of Environment and Climate (action) Catherine McKenna, was anyone who questioned the science of a looming climate apocalypse, is akin to questioning the Holocaust, ie; “a denier”.
So here we are as a federation after four years of toxic discourse: divided and adrift, led by a prime minister that barely three out of 10 voters supported, and no opposition worthy of earning a mandate to carve a different, unifying path."

Although Singh’s New Democrats did surge in the polls before last night’s election, the results they achieved prove the party is a far cry from what it was under Jack Layton.
Charlie Angus is probably not a name many people will recognize, despite having been a well-liked MP from Timmins-James Bay since 2004, he came second in the NDP leadership race with 19.4% of the vote.
During the leadership campaign, Charlie was considered a close front runner, alongside Mr. Singh, gathering most of his support from veteran New Democrat members who liked his dedication to getting back to the NDP’s roots.
Although Charlie is popular in his riding as well as with a sizable portion of the party, he isn’t popular among other NDP MPs. Only two of the 44 NDP MPs endorsed his leadership run. Both Guy Caron and Niki Ashton who got fewer votes than Charlie still received more endorsements.
This is certainly attributable to Charlie’s handling of Thomas Mulcair’s transition out as the NDP leader.
Charlie, despite advocating for the NDP to return to its grassroots heritage, quickly gained a reputation for top-down leadership.
NDP MPs said that weekly caucus meeting’s time was mostly taken up by “head table” with Angus and the leader doing the talking, handing out orders, while blocking input from backbenchers.
Mulcair was voted out as the leader in April 2016 and during the time leading up to that event, Angus failed to satisfy anyone. Quebec NDP MPs thought Angus was unfairly attempting to push Mr. Mulcair out before a new leader was selected; while other MPs, unhappy with Muclair, thought Angus had been too harsh in trying to quash the issue.
This behaviour, according to other NDP members, is typical of Charlie Angus who is said to advocate the populist position in order to benefit his career.
After coming in third place in the leadership race, Niki Ashton, MP for Churchill—Keewatinook Aski, also added to the general discontent in the party.
Despite losing in what was a fair election, Ashton accused the media of having not given her any exposure, despite coverage being about equal between all three losing candidates, going as far as accusing the media of sexism for partially focusing on her pregnancy during the race.
At the very least this backhanded excuse shows NDP members why Ashton was probably not ready for leadership to begin with.
Although Niki and Charlie do not represent all New Democrats, the fact that the choices for leadership, including Mr. Singh, were so inadequate shows the party is in a tight spot.
It may be that the NDP has been so hampered by its own politician’s ambitions for power that actual talent and leadership qualities have been sidelined. Jagmeet himself during the 2019 election seemed more focus on gaining personal popularity within the shrunk base of his party than proving himself a worthwhile alternative to the Liberals and Conservatives.
Following the NDP’s major loss last night,  likely only getting to prop up Trudeau’s Liberal government, due to the poor shape of the NDP, Singh may find himself on thin ice as party leader, with no viable replacement."

In his letter, Moe points out that the new Liberal minority government does not represent Saskatchewan and Alberta at all. Following the election, Conservatives won all 14 seats in Saskatchewan, as well as 33 out of 34 seats in Alberta, with a lone NDP candidate. The Liberals were shut out of both provinces.
“In Canada, we now have a Liberal minority government that did not receive the popular vote, has no clear mandate, will be supported by either a fourth place party that has never governed or a party that does not want to be part of this nation,” Moe writes. “This minority government also has no representation from Saskatchewan or Alberta.”
“It’s time for a new deal with Canada.”
Moe decided to take Prime Minister Justin Trudeau up on his offer of support, saying that nice words are great, but Saskatchewan and Alberta want action, and they want it now.
To remedy the fractured relationship between Western Canada and the East, Moe proposed three solutions:
Cancel the federal carbon tax.
Commit to negotiate a new equalization formula that is fair to Saskatchewan and Alberta.
Commit to develop a plan to ensure Saskatchewan and Alberta can get our exports to international markets. This means pipelines.

The Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms today issued a news release declaring victory on behalf of their clients, as an early ruling in favour of the mostly home-based salon workers was announced just one day after the Canadian federal elections.
According to the news release, The decision noted, “human rights legislation does not require a service provider to wax a type of genitals they are not trained for and have not consented to wax.” The decision further found that Yaniv “engaged in improper conduct,” “filed complaints for improper purposes,” and concluded Yaniv’s testimony was “disingenuous and self-serving.” Finally, noted the Tribunal, Yaniv was “evasive and argumentative and contradicted herself” while giving evidence.
The JCCF represented five of more than 10 aesthetician workers Yaniv brought complaints against, many of whom were immigrants or from visible minority or highly religious communities. This, along with Yaniv’s history of racially charged remarks, led many to speculate that the complaints were racist or xenophobic in nature.
Most significantly, the Tribunal ordered costs of $2,000 payable each to three of the five women represented by the Justice Centre, including one woman, Mrs. Hehar Gill, who had been forced to close her business due to Yaniv’s vexatious litigation. According to the JCCF’s news release, Mrs. Gill, a practicing Sikh, explained to Yaniv that she was only able to provide services to female clients due to her religion.

One of the most important takeaways from the election is the blue sweep throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan. Both provinces have expressed growing indignation over the other provinces’ dependence on the oil industry, while simultaneously trying to stifle Alberta’s business prospects and economic growth by opposing pipelines.

People in Saskatchewan have expressed similar discontent, as many in the province benefit from the oil industry and Saskatchewan farmers in Canada’s heartland worry climate policies will target their economy next.
Very clear that Canada is broken

Looking at this results map for #elxn43, i'm coming around to the idea of Alberta separation. In fact, looks to me like we should carve the country up into 5 or 6 new entities.

In response to Justin Trudeau’s reelection, the Facebook group for VoteWexit.com gained tens of thousands of followers in a matter of hours. According to CTV News, in just 10 minutes the group surged from 4,000 members to 42,000. By 8:00 a.m. the next morning, the group had shot up to over 113,000 members.
Additionally, a Change.org petition for “Alberta Separation/Western Alliance” has gained significant traction, receiving over 20.000 signatures of its 25,000 signature goal at the time of this article’s writing. This occurred in less than 24 hours.
“Trudeau’s re-election is going to tear Canada in half. Good job Quebec. You’ll get your separatism desires. The west is leaving,” wrote one Twitter user.
Another writes, “Western Canada – especially Alberta – is basically the victim of an abusive relationship with the rest of the country. Too scared to actually leave but what’s the benefit of staying? Not sure what the answer is but I’m worried about the next 4 years #wexit.”
The biggest concern, beyond a general shift in sentiment towards climate awareness over economic growth, for the Conservative-dominated provinces is the continued placation of Quebec from politicians in Ottawa who seem to take it out on Alberta. This is despite oil and gas revenues subsidizing Quebec’s social services through equalization payments.
Indeed, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Quebec Premier Francois Legault have had multiple verbal jousting matches over just this issue.
Alberta and Sask are all blue. The Bloc, Greens and NDP want to shut down oil. This is the time for #WexIt— Nicole Henson (@NicoleHenson) October 22, 2019
According to Mount Royal University political scientist Duane Bratt, whether the Western separatist movement gains traction will be greatly decided by Kenney’s leadership and thoughts on the issue in the coming months.
“You have this large cohort of Conservative MPs. How does the government function? How does the Trudeau government function? What is Kenney’s response?” Bratt said. “I think this is a real danger to national unity.
“Does he try to dampen that down? He didn’t during the campaign. He put out a video in August saying, ‘We don’t want to separate from Canada, we want to separate Trudeau from office.’
“Kenney then campaigns against Trudeau not just in Alberta but in Ontario and in Manitoba and he’s unsuccessful, so where do they go next?”
Mount Royal University political analyst David Taras broadly agreed with Bratt’s analysis.
“Let’s face it, the anger and alienation in western Canada is real and this government will have to deal with it,” Taras said.
“There’s a sense of just awful alienation, of really feeling deeply offended and I think the (Trudeau) government has to really take a look at what it has to do in terms of energy policy and pipelines in order to get any kind of hearing here.”
Other Canadians took to social media to ridicule the possibility of a separatist movement, saying that Alberta is landlocked and, thus, in some way reliant on the coastal provinces.
“Western separation is nonsense,” wrote one Twitter user. “A landlocked state cannot feasibly work… but I do understand the frustration and resentment in the west in a way that I never could while living in Ontario. Scary Times. #Wexit#Elxn43.”
Another Twitter user wrote, “I understand the frustration, but immediately wanting to separate from Canada after the party you support loses is the childhood equivalent of shutting off the Nintendo, taking your controller and going home when your team gets scored on. #wexit #elxn43.”
While landlocked states are more difficult to manage, some have argued that selling oil to the U.S. and countries southwards would be significantly easier without Ottawa stifling the industry.
Either way, it’s clear that alternatives to the Canadian confederation are being seriously considered.
According to a poll conducted by Think HQ in early October, 71 percent of respondents believe policies under the Trudeau government are hurting the quality of life in Alberta. That’s compared to 15 percent who felt the opposite.
Before the election, 23 percent of Albertans polled wanted to leave Canada, 17 percent were not sure, and 57 percent wanted to stay. However, many who wanted to stay were still highly dissatisfied by the state and trajectory of policies laid out in Ottawa. We cannot be sure exactly how many will change their mind, but it does appear there is a significant shift towards separatism following the election."

According to Elections Canada, the Conservatives received at least 240,000 more votes than their Liberal counterparts. The Liberals still received 36 more seats than the Conservatives.
This occurred due to the high level of support in Western provinces such as Alberta for the Conservative party, reducing the overall voter efficiency in a similar vein to what occurred in the United States during their recent presidential election. There Hillary won almost 2 million more votes, largely from California, but still decisively lost the electoral college.
While the loss of the popular vote is interesting, the massive overall drop is also itself a story.
The Liberals received roughly 33.1% of the vote, which is by far the lowest level obtained by a minority government, Conservative or Liberal in the nation’s entire history.
Right now the Trudeau Liberals have ~33% of the popular vote. Here are the pop vote results of the past six minority winners

Wilson-Raybould entered the 2019 race as an independent after leaving the Liberals due to the Prime Minister’s extremely problematic handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair.

As the Toronto Star explains, Freeland has had a “meteoric rise” in prominence since becoming an MP, in large part thanks to Justin Trudeau, who promoted her from minister of international trade to foreign minister only two years later for her work on renegotiating NAFTA.

In his letter, Pratte says that he specifically chose this time to resign, rather than earlier, because he did not want his resignation to impact the election in anyway and so that he did not distract from the campaign
He also says that his 3 ½ years on Senate have shown him that he lacks both the skills and motivation to follow through with the task Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau had given him when he was appointed in 2016.
He says that it is saddening to betray the trust Trudeau had in him, but that it would be a greater betrayal to continue on in a position for which he is unfit.
Andre Pratte is announcing his resignation from the Senate as the federal election results are rolling in.
The Independent senator from Quebec posted his resignation letter on Twitter to explain his decision.
“In any professional journey, there can come a time when we realize that we simply do not have the skills and motivation required to accomplish the task we have been entrusted with,” writes Pratte. “After three and a half years in the Senate of Canada, I have come to this conclusion.
“It saddens me to betray the trust that you [the Right Honourable Julie Payette] and the Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Justin Trudeau, had placed in me. But it would be even more of a betrayal to continue performing a task that I cannot accomplish to the level of excellence expected.”"

Since then, the clear political norm in Canada has been that the party with the most seats forms the government. And in most cases, when a leader of a party who was Prime Minister loses power, that leader resigns.
While minority governments often don’t last long, once again the convention has been that the party with the most seats remains in government until they lose a confidence vote, at which case there is a new federal election.
For nearly 100 years, that’s how we’ve done things here in Canada.
But now, the Trudeau Liberals and their media enablers are laying the groundwork for the destruction of those democratic norms, in a bid to remain in power even if they lose.
Let me say this as clear as possible: If the Liberals win fewer seats than the Conservatives, it would be insane, unacceptable, and anti-democratic for the Liberals to remain in power.
Just think about it:
The Liberals went into the election with a majority government. If they not only lose their majority but also lose so many seats that the Conservatives surpass them, then it will be an unmistakable message from the Canadian People that they want Trudeau gone.
For Trudeau to remain in power despite such a rejection from the Canadian People would be a disgrace, and would devastate any remaining faith Canadians have in our national democracy. After all, people would think “what difference does a vote make if you can defeat a government, and then that government stays in power anyway?”
Clearly, there is something very disturbing going on here as the results approach. As pointed out by J.J. McCullough on Twitter, the attempt to normalize the potential of Trudeau’s violation of Canada’s norms is crazy:
“These journalists are all “it’s normal, it’s normal!!” It is absolutely NOT normal. In 150 years of Canadian history, exactly ONE prime minister tried pulling this stunt (in 1925)—and it caused one of the single biggest democratic crises in Canadian political history.”

McCullough (@JJ_McCullough) October 20, 2019
“I’m sorry—the media’s reporting on this idea that Trudeau doesn’t have to give up power if Scheer wins a minority has been pure propaganda. They never mention what a radical break with 94 years of precedent it would be. They just try to spin something deeply abnormal as normal.”

McCullough is 100 percent correct here. It is not at all normal for Trudeau (or any PM) to try and stay in power after being defeated.
If Trudeau loses and tries to stay in power, it will be anti-democratic, anti-Canadian, and all of us must speak out against it."
0,2019-10-21T08:29:36.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/why-im-voting-ppc,Why I’m Voting PPC,"First off, I’d like to thank The Post Millennial for the opportunity to share my opinion. Freedom of speech is under attack in our country, and many other media corporations and media outlets are promoting this infringement of our basic rights.
I will preface my position by saying I have many traditional liberal values, I care about others, and I tell the truth.
I want to clean up our local environment. I want the overdose crisis to end.
I want housing to be affordable. I want single moms who have been victims of domestic abuse to have a place to go.
I want people who are disabled to have disability insurance that truly covers the cost of a care home. I want civics, personal finance and economics taught in high school.  I want a prosperous, debt-free Canada.  I want equal opportunity for all, not equal, unsatisfactory outcomes.
My name is Elliot Mashford, I am a business owner who has lived in Vancouver for over 15 years.
I employ a diverse group of people, and I am an active contributor to my community. Recently, I have become concerned with the proliferation of disinformation in the mainstream media and its impact on public policy in Canada.
I am also concerned with the direction of Canadian politics and the Canadian economy.
Our polity has degenerated into a game of identity politics, whereas established political parties eagerly pander to the whims of the ethnic groups who support them.
In turn, they engage in patronage politics by granting tax credits or offering other benefits in return for votes. Canada’s leading journalists and scholars eagerly provide accurate descriptions of such activities in other countries, yet they balk at calling things by their proper name in our own country. The time for euphemisms and political correctness is over: these practices are immoral and should be seen for what they are. This country is full of graft, corruption and abuses of the public trust.
The complacent political establishment in Canada is intensely self-interested and is eager to advance their political agenda at the expense of economic prosperity, social solidarity and all other relevant aspects of the public good.
Our mainstream federal party options consist of venal political parties who see little distinction between their personal finances and the nation’s financial resources.
As such, they have no moral qualms about using tax dollars to buy votes.
What they do not want us to know is that their profligacy is the cause of our national debt, not the solution thereof. In other words, they are holding us hostage in a vicious cycle of problems that they have created in the first place.
Naturally, most Canadians feel sympathetic to their rhetoric and cannot imagine an alternative to business as usual. After all, it may seem, an abusive relationship with our overlords seems to be a less frightening prospect than the blind terror of the unknown. Yet, psychologists are aware of this psychological malaise and it has a well-documented name: Stockholm Syndrome.
Before I dive in, I believe every Canadian has a personal responsibility to vote for the candidate they believe is most qualified to run the government.
Andrew Scheer is a fake insurance broker, and Justin Trudeau is a drama teacher.
These are the resumes of our front-runners?
For God’s sakes, I am more qualified to be the prime minister.
I cannot imagine how anyone in their right mind could entrust either of those two charlatans to be in charge of the most pressing affairs in our nation.
If this is not conclusive evidence of how the majority of our country suffers from Stockholm syndrome and a comprehensive failure of rationality, I don’t know what is.
The People’s Party of Canada had an interesting beginning.
Maxime Bernier, a long-time Conservative Party member, split off about one year ago, to establish the PPC. His departure was based on his unwillingness to sponsor the Dairy Cartel, in exchange for the Conservative leadership. Hence, he was dealt with accordingly and received a stern admonition: hit the ball back or else.
In response to standing up for Canadians’ financial interests, he was defeated as a candidate for the CPC leadership position, and this was handed to Andrew Scheer. Instead of operating within this framework, Max renounced all allegiance to mainstream politics and did the only morally admirable thing he could have done: he established his own party. The PPC is based on personal responsibility, equal opportunity and putting Canadians first.
The People’s Party of Canada understands the importance of balancing our budget, putting more money in the pocket of the individual, and maintaining the strength of our export-based economy. Furthermore, Maxime Bernier understands the ridiculous environment of virtue signalling, identity politics and tumultuous dishonesty that is being spewed by the status-quo politicians and has spoken out aggressively against this.
Everyone has good ideas, but not everyone has good solutions. For example, climate change, global warming and pollution are three completely different things and need to be addressed accordingly. For those “protesting” in the name of “fighting climate change” in Vancouver: you are the biggest consumers of manufactured goods of all time, the public policies you support would cripple our economy, and you ignore environmental and financial issues in our own backyard.
For those who think it’s okay to perpetually run a government deficit: it’s not okay, and will put all of us at extreme risk in the event of a recession or sudden shifts in the global market. Those two factors should be communicated to the NDP, Green and Liberal voters in our country. Unfortunately our taxpayer-funded media are illiterate in understanding economics and finance, so they don’t inform the public properly.
I will touch on a few policies that all status quo parties support, but the PPC does not: Corporate welfare (giving taxpayer dollars to multi-billion dollar corporations), foreign aid (give hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign governments, which is well documented to be misused by corrupt governments) and maintaining the equalization payment structure in Canada–which makes absolutely zero sense other than to some inept, corrupt provincial governments. The current EP system fails to incentivize provincial economies and robs Western Canada.
Only the People’s Party of Canada advocates personal responsibility. The PPC want to shrink government and reduce our taxes, versus creating a welfare state environment which eliminates personal incentive and equal treatment of Canadians.
The best way to grow as a person is to stop blaming your problems on others. Blaming others for your problems is a complete waste of time: you don’t learn anything, you can’t grow, and you can’t mature. However, it is also true that some diseases are better to have when you’re young.
Our institutional sclerosis that is tainted by the legacy of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the chicanery of Mr. Scheer may be a case of measles or acne. Yet, we must grow up and do so quickly before these pathogens morph into deadly viruses. We need to overcome our collective Stockholm Syndrome and there is only one way to do it: terminate our relationship with our abusers.
A young person grows up only when they stop expecting adults to solve all of their problems and the cycle of abuse ends only when we begin taking matters into our own hands. No, we are not promising a munificent welfare state or a neo-Marxist utopia (minus the secret police, the gulags and complete censorship).
We are calling upon all Canadians to acknowledge that liberty is a universal value that can thrive in all cultures and societies: ours is not an exception.  It is a paradox of freedom that liberties come with responsibilities, so we must accept our obligations and the risks that come with them in order to be truly free. Freedom is the foundation of a prosperous and truly just society. We must not allow our fellow Canadians to forget this timeless truism.
It was discovered a few days ago that the Conservative Party of Canada paid for a smear campaign to “seek and destroy” the People’s Party of Canada, while portraying Maxime Bernier and his supporters (including myself) as racists.
I have been falsely accused of being a racist countless times since I started advocating for the People’s Party of Canada.
This is a distinctive example of our current political establishment, and what they are willing to do to secure votes. It is a moral catastrophe and will not go unnoticed unless we take our stand now, we don’t need a “fake news” culture in Canada.
We cannot and will not accomplish these goals with the current political establishment. Don’t vote out of fear, vote for your values and vote for what you believe in. It’s the only way to eventually get real change.

While worrying, the enrichment largely continues Turkey’s extremely aggressive and discriminatory stance on Kurds, whom the country worries may break away or join the Kurdistan Workers’ Party(PKK) a Kurdish militant and political group, which the United States and Turkey consider as a terrorist organization.
Since 1984 the PKK has been involved in an armed conflict with the Turkish state.
Previously, Edrogen’s regime has arrested more than a dozen Kurdish lawmakers inside Turkey, with much of that attention being focused on Diyarbak?r.
Following the 2014 local elections, for example, Gültan K??anak and F?rat Anl? of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) were elected co-mayors of Diyarbak?r.
Both were detained by Turkish authorities “on thinly supported charges” of being a member of the (PKK).
Some days later, the Turkish government appointed an unelected state trustee as the mayor.
In November, public prosecutors demanded a 230-year prison sentence for K??anak.
In the 2019 Municipal election, Adnan Selçuk M?zrakl? was elected mayor of Diyarbakir.
In August 2019 he was dismissed and accused of supporting terrorism.
Adnan and three other district co-mayors from the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) party, were also detained through a police raid on their respective homes this morning, the Cumhuriyet reported.
Outside of Turkey itself, the stance has been even more aggressive, with recent videos of the nation’s invasion into Rojava allegedly showing militias killing a Kurdish lawmaker.
Outside of attacks against politicians, there have now also been allegations that chemical weapons have been used by Turkey, placing the country in war-crimes territory.
Turkey has denied any use of chemical weapons in a statement released on Thursday. The country has claimed that the Kurds dousing their own children in deadly chemicals in order to make them look bad.

Wrong to suggest that Justin Trudeau was “just not ready” to govern four years ago. In reality, it was Canadians who were just not ready for him.
You may have heard the joke that Trudeau makes two types of promises: the ones he breaks, and the ones you wish he would break. Over the past four years, Canadians have had to endure the chaos of pipeline protests, carbon tax cram-downs, abortive attempts to change our voting system, pointless foreign policy fights and messy Liberal family feuds.
Liberal partisans do not understand that their ham-handed attempts to transform Canada are not welcome. They have abused the trust that Canadians placed in them four years ago.
Today, the only people impressed with this government are foreign journalists, ex-Presidents and celebrities who don’t understand Canada or Canadians–and even they are beginning to ask questions.
It’s pretty clear that centrist Canadians voted for a fresh coat of paint in 2015, not a revolution.
A government that was basically competent while looking good would have been just fine. We got- maybe-  one of those two things.
On a bad day for the Liberals, we get neither.
Stephen Harper’s mostly cautious approach is looking a lot better these days by comparison. And it’s going to be a long time before Canadians dare to dream big again.
The CPC policy platform, campaign and leader are not flashy. And that’s the point. It’s a plan to repair the damage caused by Trudeau, and get Canada back on an even footing. It recognizes that Canadians are, understandably, a little wary of big plans right about now.
They want to restore the competence and stability that the Liberals have squandered virtue-signaling to the world instead of governing. They passed precious few bills, just so that their leader could make it on magazine covers like Rolling Stone.
The Liberals hate to admit it, but their carbon tax is only popular in theory. Canadian voters do not want to actually want to pay for expensive carbon initiatives.
Canadians have been consigning carbon-tax friendly provincial governments to the graveyard one after another ever since Trudeau took office. That’s why the CPC want it gone, and why they want to let provinces figure out how to deal with climate change.
If you look beyond Liberal spin, you’ll find a few practical environmental initiatives in their platform, such as ending the practice of dumping raw sewage into waterways, and improving technology for monitoring and managing wildfires. Canadians notice the Liberals’ inaction on these close-to-home environmental concerns much more than grand plans to fix the climate change crisis.
Diehard Liberals blame their poor electoral fortunes on a rising tide of populism. It’s ironic because Trudeau was supposed to be the guy who protected Canada from Trumpism and was in large part voted in from left-wing populism–Trudeaumania 2.0.
The Liberals own policies–a handgun ban, offering government-backed loans to homeowners and jacking up the deficit–are populist positions, not informed by sound and responsible research. This isn’t going to help curb polarization. It’ll only make things worse, because they won’t actually address poverty, illegal guns predominantly used in crime or crippling national debt.
The CPC will go back to the drawing board by getting the country’s balance sheet in order, boosting the Registered Education Savings Plan and helping to bridge gaps in health care coverage.
Incredibly, the CPC is the only party that’s taking the issue of affordability seriously. They’re taking the GST off of home heating bills, relaxing the mortgage “stress-test” for Canadians looking to buy their first homes, and restoring tax breaks for transit passes.
It’s certainly not the kind of slash-and-burn Conservative extremism the Liberals are telling you about, just a curtailing of overspending.
Speaking of extremism, look no further than the People’s Party of Canada.
These guys have got no environmental policy to speak of, want to massively slash immigration, a boon to this country, and think getting rid of supply management will create jobs but can’t be bothered to tell us how.
The mostly-online PPC seem to think that there’s a constituency in Canada for their policies. There isn’t. There never has been with the vast majority of Canadians.
Good luck to them building a pipeline in Quebec, or ripping up the Indian Act, or replacing the entire system of federal health transfers. Max Bernier can barely find enough people in his riding to support these ideas, if polls are any indication.
Right-wingers who try to lure Canadians with false promises are no better than Trudeau. They’re playing to an international populist movement, much like the Greens, and then they turn around and label the other parties “globalists”.
Why is it that with all the controversy that People’s Party leader Maxime Bernier has stirred up, he can’t get above single digits in the polls?
Not everything the PPC says is overblown and ridiculous. The PPC will tell you that they exist because the CPC isn’t conservative enough. I believe them, and I also say, “Thanks for coming out,”  because–like the Liberals–they are making the CPC look absolutely glorious by comparison.
The CPC recognizes that refugee claimants shouldn’t be able to just walk across the border at Roxham Rd. And they want to help immigrants learn official languages and get their credentials recognized.
They’re going to increase health care and social transfers, while cutting handouts to big corporations. Taxes for lower-income Canadians will be lowered, and it’ll be harder for social media giants to mine your data under a Conservative government.
Instead of frustrating small businesses and tangling them up in red tape, the CPC will repeal old regulations and simplify the tax code.
How anyone could think this CPC are a bunch of extremists with these kinds of policies is a mystery to me.
Canada, like the United States, sorely needs a return to bland, common sense normalcy. That’s what the CPC is offering."

Writing in The Star, she says: “Careful how you vote in Canada’s federal election on Monday, especially if you’re young and female. You are vulnerable. Think strategically.” She’s playing the game of identity politics by asking young women to come together and vote based on how they fear they may be treated as a group. This is a jarring, striking sentiment, but nowhere in the ensuing article does she back it up.
Careful how you vote in Canada’s federal election on Monday, especially if you’re young and female. You are vulnerable. Think strategically, writes Heather Mallick:https://t.co/T4xxmMviR2— TorontoStar (@TorontoStar) October 19, 2019
Instead of letting all young women know exactly how they are in danger, she goes on a tirade about how awful the United States is, how angry Americans all are, and how adept they are with violence. That this kind of violence will encroach on Canada is her fear, but again, she doesn’t back it up. She uses visceral language to play on emotions, instead of driving home facts. Further, she attempts to link Andrew Scheer to Trumpism without any evidence at all. It’s a dirty trick, and it confirms that she really doesn’t think much of her audience (especially the young women).
The kind of language Mallick uses to bemoan Trump and is similar to Trump’s approach to his political rivals. Using methods you condemn when employed by your opposition in order to uphold your own position is completely nonsensical, especially in this case because Trump is, essentially, his tactics.
Why would she caution young women and call them out as particularly vulnerable? Does she think they are not capable of considering all the factors, candidate positions, and making a decision based on those ideas and policy positions?
The goal is to keep young women cowering in fear about a future over which they have no control. It tells them that they should harbour doubt about their own ability to make choices. This is the kind of language we have been seeing at the forefront of so much of the social justice movement, and this style of discourse is one we’ve learned from the much-maligned Trump.
With regard to climate change, we are consistently told to behave as though our “house is on fire.” Angry climate activists glue themselves to pavement or buildings, block traffic, and generally make an unruly mess simply because they want to raise awareness about their position.
When racism, classism, and sexism are talked about, we hear that these things are getting worse. The only way in which these conditions can be said to be worse is that our expectations keep getting higher. There’s nothing wrong with high expectations, but we have to measure progress based on how far we’ve come, not on how far we’ve yet to go.
Instilling fear in young women, saying that they are particularly vulnerable to a change in leadership, is a fear-mongering tactic that hopefully most Canadian young women will see right through. Our vulnerability comes in mindlessly believing what we are told, and that acting in our best interests is something other people than ourselves can determine.
This kind of inflammatory hyperbole is an insult to independent free-thinking young women across the country. Action is never best undertaken in anger and fear.
So, I have my own message for young Canadian women: You are not weak. You are not vulnerable. You know better than to let some elitist Toronto-based think-piece specialist tell you who you are and what you should do.
You are strong and you are smart. Vote in accordance with your convictions. You got this."
0,2019-10-20T14:55:27.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/bloc-rising-the-bq-may-have-a-big-election-day,BLOC RISING: The BQ may have a big election day,"This decade has been a deeply troubling one for the Bloc Quebecois. The humiliations of the 2011 and 2015 elections have made the party very plainly marked with nostalgia, not just for the days of Lucien Bouchard or Jacques Parizeau, but anyone who could lead the party without creating a factional divide or electoral thumping.
Until a few weeks ago, separatism, and the Bloc Quebecois along with it, had been considered dead. Although the 2015 election saw some improvement for the party, they still fell two seats short of official party status.
The Bloc’s abrupt frailty in this decade has been placed on their inability to stop banging on about separation and independence referendums. There is now an inertia in Quebec with separatism that the Bloc failed to perceive or adapt to. This, alongside Jack Layton’s folksy charisma cast the Bloc Quebecois into a lonely irrelevance.
The 2018 provincial election only seemed to confirm this diagnosis. The CAQ, which is composed of many ex-separatist politicians, stormed to power on a ticket that could hardly be bothered with separatism at all. The polling only corroborated this, with 82 percent of Quebecois now stating that separatism was a non-issue.
In many ways, the CAQ’s roaring success has served as a bitter lesson to the Bloc. Although separatism is indeed a “non-issue,” nationalism, and a desire for greater sovereignty certainly is not. Francois Legault’s CAQ capitalized on this sentiment, pledging to protect Quebec in Canada whilst creating demagogic policy (Note the secularism bill).
The efficacy of this strategy is plain. A year after Quebec’s provincial election, the CAQ remains a deeply popular party amongst the Quebecois, with a 74% approval rating.
The Bloc’s leader, Yves-François Blanchet, has evidently understood this new phenomenon. He has meticulously copied the CAQ’s 2018 manifesto and has defended the actions of Quebec’s government in the debates to an irritated Canada.
If the polling is correct, Blanchet’s plagiarism has been entirely successful. In national polls, the Bloc are nearly two whole points higher than their polling in 2015. And so, if Canada discovers there is no majority tomorrow, Blanchet may find himself as the kingmaker.
There are, perhaps, other explanations for the Bloc’s success. For the more cynical amongst us, their success has to do with the NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh. The NDP leader is, of course, the first minority leader in Canada’s history. Many have argued that Quebec is simply “just not ready” for a brown Prime Minister.
Nevertheless, if these polls are correct, and Blanchet’s Bloc Quebecois does as well as they are expected to, then Canadians across the country should clench their jaw in concern. Separatist sentiment is unpredictable— it waxes and wanes naturally, and can explode through seemingly innocuous events. Catalonia and Scotland have made this starkly clear.
Whatever your opinion of Legault and Blanchet may be, it is necessary to understand that they are deeply sophisticated politicians, willing to capitalize on the inevitable shifting of separatist sentiment within Quebec.
If tomorrow, the Quebecois choose to elect a strong separatist party into Ottawa, supported by an equally strong CAQ in Quebec City (whose opinions on separatism are far less clear) then we have to be prepared that separatism is much more alive than we think."

They’ve claimed the Conservatives are cutting billions, which is a false claim, since all the Conservatives are doing is reducing the growth of upcoming government spending. As we can all grasp, reducing the growth of spending is not the same as cutting spending. So, the Liberals are lying.
The Liberals have claimed Scheer will re-open the abortion debate, even though he’s repeatedly said he will not, even though Conservative Party policy is to leave the debate closed, and even though the Conservatives didn’t change abortion laws in their 10 years in power under Stephen Harper. So again, the Liberals are lying.
And of course, the Liberals have repeatedly said that Andrew Scheer is somehow a “risk” to the rights of LGBT Canadians, even though official Conservative Party policy supports same-sex marriage, and Scheer has also made clear that he will not make any changes in that regard. So again, the Liberals are lying.
See a pattern here?
The Liberals have based their entire campaign around lies designed to demonize Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives.
Yet, have you seen the media accuse Trudeau of “misinformation”?
Have you watched reporters straight-up call Trudeau’s claims “lies,” “falsehoods,” or “made up”?
Of course not.
Instead of calling Trudeau out for his endless lies, the media has reported them as facts, forcing the Conservatives to spend precious campaign time responding to Trudeau’s repeated spreading of misinformation.
Yet, the second Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives speculated about the potential dangers of a Liberal-NDP coalition, the establishment media jumped all over them and accused them of lying.
Andrew Scheer made the reasonable point that since the Liberals and NDP are promising tens of billions of dollars in spending that isn’t paid for, it’s likely that tax hikes would be used to pay for it. And to get that kind of revenue, a Liberal-NDP coalition would have to raise the GST to 7.5 percent, a massive hike from the current 5 percent.
But, instead of forcing Justin Trudeau and Jagmeet Singh to explain where they’ll get the money, and instead of reporting Scheer’s speculation as facts, the establishment media instead accused Scheer of “lying,” and said his claims were “made up.”
A total double-standard.
What this shows is that the anti-Conservative bias of the establishment media is getting even worse as election day nears. The establishment press is trying to turn the Canadian People against the Conservatives, and is trying to ensure Justin Trudeau stays in power.
It’s a level of manipulation that is profoundly anti-democratic and dangerous to the future of our democracy."

Their concerns stem from her position as an MP responsible for promoting trade with China and her connection to Michael Chan, a former minister of citizenship, immigration and international trade in Ontario’s Wynne government, according to a Global News exclusive.
It was revealed in June that Michael Chan would be her co-chair. This has sparked controversy as Chan was previously investigated by Canada’s intelligence agency (CSIS) for the alleged possibility of being an agent for China.
According to a 2015 Globe and Mail report, Chan maintained close ties to the Chinese consulate in Toronto while a minister and was at risk of influence from associates in China. According to the report he’s also been “a mentor to a cadre of provincial and federal Liberals running for office, which has triggered both criticism and trepidation among pro-democratic community members.”
“Michael Chan is known to be very close to China, and according to news reports, he was accused of being accessible to Chinese Communist Party influence,” said Ringo Wong, a Markham-Thornhill constituent. “Having him as a key organizer of (Ng’s) campaign worries me.”
Chan has also come out in favour of China’s absolute rule and one-China policy, saying that he supports Hong Kong police’s strict measures to quash the protests and maintain a unified China.
The riding which Ng is running for is densely populated by Chinese Canadians, both for and against the pro-Democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong, and tensions have been steadily rising between the two groups. As such, the group Torontonians Stand With Hong Kong have been vigilant in investigating the relations that their representative may have.
Global News attempted to contact Ng regarding her connection with Chan and potential pro-Beijing sentiments, but she was unavailable. However, her campaign responded by saying that Chan was never an active member of the campaign, despite originally accepting the request to be co-chair.
Ng was also asked by Wong why she attended a People’s Republic of China 70th-anniversary celebration on Sept. 29 when she could potentially become a Canadian government minister.
While inquiries from Global News remained fruitless, this critique did prompt a response from Ng.
“I would point out, also in attendance was the Conservative Party of Canada Candidate for Markham-Thornhill,” Ng responded. “As the Member of Parliament for Markham-Thornhill, one of Canada’s most diverse ridings, it is important to support inclusiveness in our community. As a proud Canadian, I will always celebrate the many cultural traditions and heritages that make up this wonderful riding.”
Correction: The initial version of this article incorrectly stated Hong Kong Canadians were accusing Mary Ng of having close ties to China. They were instead questioning her hiring Michael Chan, who has been accused in the past of being an agent for the Chinese government. The Post Millennial regrets the error."

His original comment came after being asked if he would respect a Conservative majority. The very question made him laugh, and he said, chuckling, “We don’t respect Conservatives, no.”
Considering somewhere in the region of 30-35 per cent of the country is ready to vote Conservative, the comment left Jagmeet with a bad taste in his mouth — ostracizing a third of the country for a difference of opinion has that effect on someone that needs to swing voters to his side.
On Friday, while speaking to a NDP crowd in Port Alberni, B.C., Singh apologized and said that he felt bad about his initial response.
“I believe that we need to build a country where we welcome everybody, we respect everybody, and I feel bad about what I said,” he said.
“We’re going to have differences of opinions. I want to make it clear: Our whole movement has been about making sure people feel welcome, they feel accepted and people should be accepted no matter what their political views are.”
He also tried to explain his initial response, saying it was less about the people voting Conservative, and more about the policies being put forward by the Conservative Party that he finds distasteful."

He affirmed that Quebec has always received special treatment.
“Well not right now, it’s been a continuous thing,” he said. “It’s been forever really”
He also accused candidates of almost exclusively appealing to the interests of provinces with the most ridings, rather than less prominent provinces such as Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Furthermore, Higgs said that the country has become “more divided than ever,” and that the Trudeau is alienating the Western provinces by choosing to appeal to climate change activists rather than reassuring workers in the petroleum sector.
He also said that while Quebec is a “special case,” they should understand their precarious position in the country and “where the value of money comes from,” bringing up the fact their social services are paid for by oil revenues from Alberta.
“When you get $13 billion a year in transfer payments for being part of a nation, then there has to be some obligations that come with that,” he said, mentioning Quebec’s progressively separatist attitude and two sovereignty referendums."

That’s when the “lock him up” chant started. At this point, Scheer cautioned the crowd: “Well … Let’s … We’re going to get to the bottom of his scandal. We’re going to vote him out.”
Scheer then suggested that the crowd chant “vote him out” instead of “lock him up” and they enthusiastically obliged."

Documents and insider sources aware of the plan show that the firm plotted to highlight racism and xenophobia in the PPC for an unnamed client. Furthermore, it is alleged that they also tried to prevent Maxime Bernier from participating in the leaders’ debates.
Insiders claim that the client was the Conservative Party of Canada.
The project employed four people full-time to “seek and destroy” the fledgling party in an operation called “Project Cactus”.
Documents show that the project was run in three phases including a research and branding phase, a launch phase, and a “full steam ahead phase”.
The intention of the final phase was to  “push Maxime Bernier and the PCC off their messages — forcing  them, instead, to defend instances of hate speech and sympathy for  racism.”
PPC leader Maxime Bernier has since filed a complaint with the Commissioner of Elections Canada.
“This secret campaign is an attack on the integrity of our democratic process. I can assure you we will take every means at our disposal to get to the bottom of this story,” said Bernier during a news conference earlier today.
Internal chatroom logs show that the twitter account STAMP Out Hate was used to publish tweets attacking the PPC.
“Daisy will create an arm’s-length organization that cannot be linked to the client or any participating organization. This organization will run a proxy war room public relations campaign that allows real Canadians to shine a light on the prejudice and hate that is associated with the PPC,”  claimed a Daisy Group consultant.
When asked about the accusations, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer refused to comment on whether  the CPC employed Kinsella’s firm.
The account carried on this behavior until June 29, just before third party advertising restrictions kicked in.
“It hardly comes as a surprise that the Conservative Party of Canada would be behind such disgraceful and cowardly tactics. As our Leader Maxime Bernier stated when he left the CPC and repeated on numerous occasions since then, they are ‘morally and intellectually corrupt.’ And today, this story proves it without a doubt,” said PPC executive director Johanne Mennie.
Earlier this year it was announced that Kinsella also worked on the Green Party’s campaign for a brief period of time.
Kinsella has since deleted his social media accounts and has stood by his firm’s actions. In his statement, Kinsella claimed that the source was a former employee who was fired for making anti-semitic comments and stealing from his company."

Over the federal campaign, the Prime Minister has made an interesting transition.
The Liberal Leader has gone from the progressive defender of liberal values to the de facto protector of Quebec’s growing sovereigntist movement (all while also triggering Alberta’s own growing desire for secession).
The process has genuinely been uncanny.
In English, the PM remains the clearest on his intent to take on Quebec’s bill 21.
For those living outside the province, the controversial law bans some public-sector employees, including teachers and daycare employees from wearing religious symbols in the workplace, such as hijabs for Muslim women and Kippah for Jewish men.
The law is overwhelmingly popular with Francophones in Quebec, while a significant portion of Anglophones also support the bill.
According to a poll conducted by Leger Marketing and commissioned by the Association for Canadian Studies, roughly 30% of anglophones and more than 70% of francophones think religious symbols should be banned.
A poll by the CAQ government places Anglophone support as high as 43%.
In response to the high level of support, the Quebec government has used the notwithstanding clause in the Constitution to avoid having the law struck down as a violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Trudeau in English has said he may at some point intervene, maybe.
As sad as that sounds, that is the best Canadian leaders could muster.
But when Trudeau steps over into Quebec itself, an area he must sweep to retain his position as Prime Minister, his beliefs magically change in French.
Trudeau, like Kellie Leitch, whom he once detested for her arguing the same thing, now states Quebec has the right to impose a test on immigrants in order to protect its language and identity. In Trudeau’s own words, “it’s appropriate.”
The PM has even refused to comment on the discriminatory nature of bill 21 more than once. Of course, this should be unsurprising, as even before the campaign, there were clear signs that the politics of inclusion did not apply to Quebec.
For example, Trudeau allowed the province to lower the number of immigrants it takes in temporarily, a move that supposedly went against the very moral fibre of the government’s basic principles since being elected.
While Trudeau has been willing to brand his many federal opponents as bigots in search of votes for these same views, the PM’s doublespeak on minority policies reveals something far worse–the clear possibility that he would sell out every single immigrant and practicing Jew, Muslim, or Christian if it meant securing more votes.
This is isn’t a politics of morality, where minorities are protected, and diversity is a strength.
Instead, we have something rather sinister, a politics where minority groups are used as props as long as it benefits a party’s chances of winning. And what happens when the odds stop working in favour of the party, you may ask?
Well, as shown by the PM’s continued kowtowing, the party throws the minority to the wolves and finds the next group it can sucker in."

Such violations include overstaying VISAs or remaining in the country after a refugee claim has been rejected.
However, Global News recently uncovered that the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) “cancels arrest warrants for failed refugee claimants and other people wanted for removal who it cannot find, even in cases where it is not clear whether a person has left Canada.”
According to Global News, the CBSA often cancels an outstanding warrant for someone who has violated immigration laws after the CBSA loses track of that person’s whereabouts. Furthermore, the CBSA is unable to perfectly track whether someone who has violated immigration law has indeed left the country, as they only have access to information on people who have left by ground routes and not by air.
Former border agent and professor at Mount Royal University Kelly Sundberg says that border agents have been cancelling such warrants for people facing deportation for over a decade, well before the CBSA was created in 2003.
“It’s crazy,” Sundberg said. “There’s no way we should have been doing it this way.”
Sundberg says this was common if the person had not committed a crime while in Canada, with border agents only actively going after those whose whereabouts are known and who have broken some other law.
According to Global News, the CBSA considers how long “someone has been wanted in Canada without being detected, plus the age of the wanted individual.” If a person has evaded detection for over 10 years and have not committed any other crime, it’s normal for their warrant to be cancelled.
“In limited circumstances, an immigration warrant may be cancelled even if it cannot be confirmed that an individual has left Canada,” said CBSA spokesperson Rebecca Purdy.
“CBSA officers must exercise due diligence in exhausting all leads to locate an individual before a warrant can be cancelled.”
Since this revelation, Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have came out strongly against the practice, saying that, if elected, they will put a stop to the cancellation of outstanding warrants.
“We believe that when someone has been ordered deported, that should be carried out,” Scheer stated Friday.
“Cancelling warrants for those ordered deported is unacceptable and a Conservative government will fix this broken process,” added Conservative Party spokesperson Simon Jefferies."

“I want [the climate protesters] to know that when they charged their iPhones last night, it was with power being generated out of this plant,” Kenney said outside a powerplant on Friday.
“When they powered up the speakers at the legislature, today, the power that lets them be heard came from power generated at powerplants like this — that will be cutting their greenhouse gas emissions in half because of practical measures like this,” he continued, referring to the establishment of a new natural gas pipeline.
Kenney then went on to criticize the impractically of the protesters’ solutions to climate change, saying that the protesters are calling for the end of the “modern industrial economy” and that their plans, if implanted, would have catastrophic results on the local, national, and global level.
Rather than preventing Canadians from “heating their homes during the winter,” Kenney advocated “real-world solutions,” such as creating more ecologically efficient and cleaner means of transporting and extracting oil and gas."

Sadly, the above pattern appears to be the norm for the Buffalo Chronicle, a Buffalo, New York, based website whose address appears fake, and whose likely fictitious “sources” remain anonymous and unverifiable.
As someone who has lived in Buffalo and worked in media there, I feel I must help spread the gospel to Canadians that The Buffalo Chronicle is completely f-ing fake ????? https://t.co/5p8Ars4J4h— Marsha McLeod (@marshamcleod_TO) October 12, 2019
So far many Canadians have found themselves caught in the middle, sharing the site’s content and in effect signal-boosting the website towards an Alexa ranking approaching the top 400,000, suggesting a small but still impactful influence.
With several of the outlet’s Canadian audience being sizable enough, multiple outlets have called out the organization including Canadaland, which criticized the organization as early as March and then again this month, and Buzzfeed which published in Mid-October.
Interestingly, while multiple private news organizations continue to call out the Buffalo Chronicle’s history of fictitious stories, the CBC’s news team has been largely mum with the only content on the Chronicle being months old, and from CBC’s flagship show, The National, rather than its multi-person fake news team.
While the multiple critiques from mostly private news organizations have been public, it seems the Buffalo Chronicle has no plans of changing its basic model.
This for the most is unsurprising.
For the love of God stop sharing stories from the Buffalo Chronicle.

It's a fake news site run by some grifter in the U.S. who's having a good laugh at Canadian expense (and probably pocketing pretty good ad money too.)

Think of him as a Buffalo-based Nigerian prince.— Rachel Curran (@reicurran) October 15, 2019
According to Alexa rankings, the Buffalo Chronicle receives two-thirds of its traffic from Canada, making it far more a Canadian fake news site, than an American one. During our election, one Canadian politics story alone was shared more than 10,800 times and was pushed to more than 895,000 users. That’s a lot of people potentially disinformed, believing lies.
As Canadians continue to share the Chronicle‘s content, it seems at least one social media platform has had to get involved, as the site has now been suspended from Twitter. Facebook has still refused to remove the site’s content from its platform, although it did reach out to the government once the story began to spread.
Buffalo Chronicle has been booted off Twitter — Facebook happy to keep em around. pic.twitter.com/9BOxsWcTPO— Justin Ling (@Justin_Ling) October 18, 2019
While platform suspensions can curtail some traffic, it is likely that the Chronicle’s overall traffic will be reduced by only a small amount as Twitter only maintains one-tenth of the audience of other platform giants such as Facebook or Google."

The story in question alleges that one of Trudeau’s former students had been having sexual relations with the future Prime Minister at the age of 17 while he was teaching at West Point Grey Academy, a prestigious B.C. private school. A subsequent story further alleges that the student, who would now in her mid-30s, received $2.25 million to sign an NDA to not talk about the alleged relationship, according to the Buffalo Chronicle’s unnamed source, who they say is a friend of the woman’s family.
According to iPolitics, the story, originally published October 7, had been shared roughly 40,000 times on Facebook and caught the attention of Facebook’s fact checking partner Agence France-Presse (AFP). The AFP deemed the story “false,” which Facebook “relayed to the Privy Council Office (PCO) that it had undertaken its standard response, which the office confirmed.”
Facebook and the PCO have yet to directly answer specific questions regarding the story, story’s contents, or the connection between the two parties; however, Facebook released a brief statement regarding Facebook’s contacting the PCO.
“We have close working relationships with the Office of the Commissioner of Canada Elections, the Privy Council Office and other public authorities to ensure close co-ordination and the protection of the election,” Erin Taylor, a spokesperson for Facebook, said in response to a set of questions asking about her company’s election campaign communications with PCO,” reports iPolitics.
Despite being labelled “false” by the AFP, Facebook says it will not remove the story, as publishing a fake news story does not technically break its terms of service, and, likely, they do not want to travel too far down the slippery slope of becoming the final say in what is and isn’t truth.
However, the discrediting of the Buffalo Chronicle’s fabricated story has negatively impacted the news outlet’s credibility as a whole, with many writers contacting the outlet asking that their names be removed from their writer’s list or claiming that they never wrote for the Chronicle in the first place."

Kmiec, like Yurdiga, who has been pushing for regulatory changes to disability assistance since submitting his private members’ motion (PMM 192) last year in parliament, sees the need for a better “safety net.”
Both propose better financial supplements as well as reducing eligibility requirements for at-risk and vulnerable Canadians.
Notably, Bill C-399 would reduce the required hours of therapy for a patient to be eligible for a tax credit. In changing the parameters from 14 hours to ten hours per week, those who suffer from episodic disabilities like multiple sclerosis, or face limitations in accessing the Disability Tax Credits due to the time they must take off work, would face less of a pinch financially.
According to estimates by the Parliamentary Budget Office (PMO), the proposed changes would make 35,000 additional claimants eligible for the tax credits each year, with 22,000 expected to make assistance claims each tax year.
During a parliamentary session in March 2018, Kmiec spoke for those writing to him in support of Bill C-399, saying that, “[My constituents] want to protect diabetics and patients with rare diseases so they can apply for the disability tax credit. They want to ensure that they receive the benefits they deserve and are entitled to.”
The Fairness For Persons with Disabilities Act would also allow for the time taken to measure and balance nutrition content for dietary disorders as part of the time in therapy.
In an interview with The Post Millennial, Yurdiga explained that people who suffer from disorders like PKU, have to “weigh [their] food very carefully, which takes a lot of time to do if you are mixing different foods to get to the right dosage. All of those things were not allowed to be included in the [therapy] calculation,” clearly showing the gaps in the current disability legislation Tom and himself are trying to fill.
The PMO stated that Bill C-399 would only cost Candian taxpayers $39 million annually, of which $25 million would be incurred from lost tax revenue by those newly qualified for assistance.
When speaking about the cost of Bill C-399, Yurdiga emphasized the meagre cost of his proposed legislation regarding what he called the Liberal government’s “corporate welfare.”
“We’re trying to make sure that Canadians are getting ahead while liberals are making sure that their corporate friends get ahead…We’re trying to leave money in the pockets of people with disabilities who are trying to make ends meet,” Yurdiga explained.
Their continued advocacy of episodic disabilities and other ailments facilitates much-needed discussions on the difficulties patients face. Given the symptoms are not always visible, it can be hard to portray the needs of vulnerable populations.
First-hand experiences inspired Yurdiga’s private member’s motion with episodic disabilities. His wife, Kathy, has multiple sclerosis, and their daughter is diagnosed with epilepsy.
As for Kmiec’s inspiration, he states, “My three little kids have a rare kidney condition called Alport syndrome, so I’ve always been paying attention to the different costs associated with living with a rare disease. My oldest son has hearing aids, my youngest son is probably going to get hearing aids, and my youngest daughter passed away. She had lots of other medical conditions while she was alive. So I have always been involved in trying to figure out how to make life more affordable for people with disabilities.”
Kmiec has worked closely with the MS Society, and other like groups, where they hold an advisory role in helping shape his legislation on disabilities.
The Fairness for Persons with Disabilities Act seems like a common-sense move, and the motives and financials behind it are nothing but responsible and researched.
But beyond its logistics, the continued advocacy projects compassion and strength.
This proposed legislation has the power to bring parliament together, bettering the lives of thousands of Canadians."

As the Conservative candidate in the Northern B.C. riding of Skeena—Bulkley Valley, Claire decided to run for federal office after a successful term as a Kitimat councillor, having escaped the clutches of homelessness and poverty eight years prior.
Delving into the topics of resource development, women in politics, as well as the adversity she has faced, Claire provides her take on the Conservative movement in Canada.
TPM: Claire, having moved from Vancouver to Kitimat as a 19-year-old, you went on to serve as a Kitimat municipal councillor as well as own and operate a tattoo shop. Can you delve a little into what shaped/influenced your political values today?
CR: Yeah. I think that being a small business owner and understanding the value of fiscal responsibility [where I made] sacrifices to ensure that my employees were paid on time and paid well – all of those factors, while also running a household, helped to shape my views. That was one of the key things that I carried forward into my work as a school councillor, I paid a lot of attention to where we were spending money, where we were getting the most effective use for it, [and that] we were operating not only within our means but within what would be best for the community.
TPM: How has this journey been for you, as a CPC candidate, compared to your term as a councillor in Kitimat?
CR: Well, I think there are distinct differences. I mean, the sheer size of the riding, the number of people that you could potentially be representing, the number of contacts that you have to make, and that’s why I put so much time and effort into my door knocking.
I’ve been on the doors every day, thousands of doors. We’re getting closer and closer to 10,000 doors, which in a riding of this size, and this type of geography is monumental. It’s not an easy task by any means. I think that that is one of the biggest differences, and then also coupling that with the fact that you’re not just looking at one community issue, you’re looking at issues from a very, very wide variety of communities that are facing unique struggles, and finding ways to find solutions for all.
TPM: The importance of the $40 billion investment into the BC LNG project was crucial for your riding. What discussions are you having at the doors regarding the importance of resource development?
CR: I would say that the majority of residents in this riding are in favour of the energy industry. That’s been made pretty evident by the amount of community support the project has had among First Nations that have signed on to agreements with them. The fact is, this project has unprecedented levels of community support. And I think that there’s a couple of reasons for that.
I mean, one is the LNG Canada has been a fantastic partner to work with. They have invested in the community, and [are] good corporate citizens. They spend the time to educate people on what the realities of liquefied natural gas are and ensure that they mitigate as much of the possible negative impacts as they can. So by and large, the majority, the vast majority of people in this riding, are very much in favour of the LNG project.
I’ve also had a few conversations with people that weren’t so in favour or were sitting on the fence. And the majority of those people don’t understand the differences between liquefied natural gas and oil [and their subsequent impacts]. So they assume that it’s very similar to oil being put in a pipeline. With just a little bit of that education in this area, people realize that some of their fears were unfounded.
TPM: For the past few years, conflicts between B.C. and Alberta have persisted regarding TMX. Given private investment has helped rejuvenate Haisla First Nation in the past decade, is there any hope for constructive dialogue on the environment and resource development, moving forward?
CR: I’ll be honest. I very rarely hear about it. It rarely comes up at the doors. It did come up in one of the debates we’ve had so far, just very briefly, and it was only centred around how do the candidates feel about the federal Liberals and the pipeline. So that’s not a big topic in my riding; people are much more focused on LNG. I think the [uncertainty felt] was simply because of the Enbridge project. And people believed that this LNG project is very similar to the Northern Gateway pipeline, which of course it isn’t.
When it comes to that environmental piece, I think that again, it just comes down to education and helping people to understand the significant positive impact that a project like this will have on our environment. When you look at things from a global scale, which we should be doing when it comes to our environment because the environment and climate change don’t know boundaries of countries and continents.
We, in Canada, only produce about 1.6 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the world. When we look at countries, specifically China, for example, where they’re burning a lot of coal, projects like liquefied natural gas can help them transition away from coal-burning and do more good for the environment overall. At the same time, we have the economic benefit that comes along with having a project like this, because we get more educational opportunities, more employment opportunities, there’s more money being invested back into our local economy here. So it’s a win-win on both sides.
TPM: How important is it for the CPC to continue attracting more women to run for office in a profession once dominated by men?
CR: In my experience, my party has in no way been trying to specifically recruit within that environment for something that is a requirement for some of the other parties. We’re looking at people that are qualified to do the job, and that want to step forward. So I wasn’t in any way recruited. I came forward and said, this is something I want to do. And I’m very grateful that the party has accepted me so well, mainly because I’m not just a woman. I’m also young and a little “alternative looking” because I’m covered in tattoos and piercings. The response I’ve received has been so warm and so welcoming.
I believe we’re seeing more women stepping forward, because we [elected] a fake feminist Prime Minister, who espouses his views of gender equality and gender parity in his cabinet. He was all about what builds women up, and yet, he didn’t attract women that were, for the most part, qualified for their positions. That is why we’re in some of the situations that we are now in Canada, because people were elected to positions that they weren’t ready to take on.
Something that I’ve always really admired about my party is that the women that we have in this party are more than capable. They’re absolute powerhouses. They have proven time and time again that women are capable of doing these things, bringing their A-game. They know what they’re talking about, do their research, and have great role models.
For me, that’s been Michelle Rempel, who I’m so grateful to call my friend and my mentor. Watching her give speeches is what motivated me to get involved and realize that I can be taken seriously. That I can do these things. People shouldn’t vote for somebody simply because they’re a woman. You should vote for the person if they’re the best for the job. I’m the only woman running in this riding, if that were a valid argument, I would be using it, but I’m not.
TPM: The leader of your party was quoted, saying, “Diversity is the result of our strength, and our strength is and has always been our freedom.” How crucial is this sort of messaging, moving forward, during and after the election?
CR: Yeah, I think it is important that people realize that – and it’s one of the biggest stigmas that I like breaking about my party because I think there’s been there’s been this stigma that we are a party of middle-aged white men and that there’s no diversity. But there truly is, and I have an excellent little anecdote to share with you, that kind of sums that up for me.
During my time as a municipal councillor, I’m sure most people already recognize that, for the most part, municipal politics is dominated by more left-leaning politicians. I attended many different conventions, UBCM, FCM, and CLGA and had the opportunity to speak with many other municipal councillors and mayors and connect. So at every single one of those that I went to, at least once during the event, I would have somebody say something just absolutely awful to me.
People have mistaken me for a waitress quite often and tried to get me to bring them drinks. I had people tell me that there’s no way I could have been elected, I must have been acclaimed. People that didn’t believe me and tried to get me removed from events because they thought I was lying about being a municipal councillor. There was a lot of verbal abuse from people in those settings.
I remember one specific time that I was at FCM, so all across Canada, we’ve got municipal councillors, and the mayor’s at this event. And I’m going up an escalator, and there was a well-known mayor from another community coming down the escalator with a friend of his, and he looked me up and down and looked at my tattoos and said that I was “everything that’s wrong with this country.”
And so I went into politics, thinking that I would struggle to have anyone take me seriously and give me the chance to speak before they made a judgment based on my appearance. And so again, that’s why somebody like Michelle Rempel, stood out to me, and I realized that I am capable.
The biggest thing for me that opened my eyes up to this is I attended the Conservative convention last year in Halifax. This was the first convention of a political nature that I did not have a single rude comment from anyone. People that I didn’t know were coming up to me and told me how excited they were that I was there. And that it made them very proud to see this younger generation getting involved and that they understand our values. The amount of positive reinforcement I received, if my mind wasn’t already made up, it was then.
I think that quite often we hear left-leaning politicians speaking loudly about how they are so tolerant, and yet, their tolerance only goes so far as you agree with them. If you disagree with them, they’ll pick on you for anything, whether it’s your gender, your age, you know, the way you look, it doesn’t seem to matter. They are only tolerant to a certain point, and that’s about as far as it goes if you agree with what they think.
So the irony to me is that I’ve had a lot of abuse throughout this. It’s been from people making fun of the way I look or saying that I’m too young or inexperienced, or I’m a woman and picking on me for that. So I think it was a stark parallel between what people have come to believe, just from what they hear in the media and things of that nature and my actual lived experience with that."

The Liberal candidate for Montreal riding Pierrefonds-Dollard already back-peddled on 9/11 conspiracy theories he’s floated, most recently in 2011 when Zuberi remarked on social media that Osama bin Laden’s involvement was “still a matter of public debate”.
Questions by The Post Millennial about Zuberi’s participation in the Concordia riot were referred to his September 14, 2019 Facebook post, in which he clarifies his position on the 9/11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon.
“It obviously is and has always been clear to me that Osama Bin Laden was the perpetrator of the September 11 terror attacks,” Zuberi writes.
The riot at Concordia University on September 9, 2002 did $17,000 damage to the Henry F. Hall Building, resulted in injuries, criminal charges and caused the cancellation of then-former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech.
Hillel, a Jewish campus student club had organized the event and Zuberi’s politics at the time–previously reported by TPM here–placed him on the other side of what turned into a violent, anti-Israel demonstration.
Given Zuberi’s involvement in the demonstration, TPM reached out for him to clarify his position on free speech in Canada, and if he supports Israel’s right to exist as a nation-state. Still no response.
Then-Concordia undergrad Daniel Ross has had similar luck with the Liberal Party in getting answers about their candidate in Pierrefonds-Dollard.
Ross provided TPM corroborating documents and photos of Zuberi at the event, while his own recollection of the day comes largely from inside the hall where Netanyahu was supposed to speak.
Ross had made it into the venue and did not witness the violence that prevented others from gaining entrance, but maintains  Zuberi was in the thick of the chaos.
“He was the vice president of the student union at the time the riot happened and that was the time I was a student, so he was known,” said Ross, who described himself as “loosely affiliated with Hillel … in those social circles” at the time.
“From my point of view, (Zuberi) was involved in an event that was violent and hateful and nobody denies that this event unfolded. I don’t see how anyone could deny that he was in the event. I don’t think he’s denied it.”
Yves Engler, who at the time shared VP duties with Zuberi at the student union, was suspended for his participation along with two other students found guilty of “threatening or violent conduct” and “harassment”.
These charges were levied by the university under the school’s code of rights and responsibilities and separate from criminal charges against other individuals related to the incident that Montreal police were pursuing at the time.
During the January 2003 Concordia University Student Panel hearing into the students’ conduct violations, Jean-Marc Bouchard, lawyer for the accused, places Zuberi at the scene and in a prominent role among the demonstrators.
“Mr. Sameer Zuberi is seen outside the Hall Building being shoved by a police officer. He tells students to ‘sit down and they cannot move you’,” lawyer Jean-Marc Bouchard told the panel, while narrating video evidence.
“This is to illustrate that violence was not the prevailing attitude that day. The demonstrators are agitated when Zuberi is shoved but when he asked them to sit down, they are calm.”
National Post columnist and Quillette editor Jon Kay was also in attendance and describes the scene in a 2003 article he penned on kid-glove treatment agitators received from the university, and the fallout for “free speech and unfettered inquiry”.
From Kay’s point of view as a besieged ticket holder, the prevailing attitude of demonstrators was decidedly violent.
“Like others, I was sprayed with ketchup from a plastic bottle–a symbol, apparently, of Palestinian blood. The kicks didn’t hurt much. They were designed to provoke me into starting a fistfight or something equally stupid,” writes Kay.
“In a regular setting, many of these people were no doubt decent souls. But they’d been whipped into a frenzy by speakers shrieking denunciations of Israel and everyone who supported it.”
Two years after the Concordia riot, the university denied Hillel from hosting former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak on campus in October of 2004."

Look at this. A Liberal candidate using CBC video in a partisan ad. I wonder if a lawsuit has been launched?!
I have asked CBC and I’m waiting to hear back. #cdnpoli #elxn43 https://t.co/vQ3XZEr9kA— Brian Lilley (@brianlilley) October 17, 2019
The Calgary Skyview candidate Nirmala Naidoo, edited copious amount of CBC shots into her partisan advertising. According to the CBC, they had asked that the advertisement be removed for using the footage without their permission.
Naidoo apparently complied with the request and that was the end of the story. She is herself a former CBC employee and reporter.
“It starts with a phone call, then a letter and escalates from there. In this particular instance, the candidate complied with our request immediately after we reached out,” said  CBC spokesperson Chuck Thompson.
However, a similar incident with the Conservative Party has led to a controversial lawsuit waged by the national broadcaster against the main party contending the Liberals in 2019.
Despite the fact that the Conservatives claim that they pulled the advertisement shortly after being contacted by the CBC, the public broadcaster has filed an application with the federal court against the party.
The lawsuit initially named Rosemary Barton and John Paul Tasker, but the journalists’ names were later pulled by the company."
0,2019-10-18T09:11:58.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/as-election-approaches-dont-forget-trudeaus-neglect-of-the-yazidi-people,"As election approaches, don’t forget Trudeau’s neglect of the Yazidi people","By now, most Canadians’ voting intentions are settled. It’s late in the day to be reminding people of why they should—or shouldn’t—consider a party or its leader worthy of their vote. Nevertheless, since no other commentator has brought the issue up, I want to remind readers of the Trudeau government’s shameful neglect of the Yazidi people in their hour of greatest need.
The genocide of the Yazidis, an ancient, peaceful, monotheistic people who have lived in Iraq and Syria since time immemorial, fell victim to ISIL in a terror campaign that lasted from 2014-17. In Aug and Dec 2014, the systematic rapes of 7,000 Yazidi women were reported by Human rights Watch and Amnesty International, and in October, 2014, the UN reported that 5,000 Yazidi men had been executed—a campaign carried out in a style perfected in Eastern Europe’s “Bloodlands” by the Nazis, now called “The Holocaust by Bullets.” So there was no question about the veracity of the facts. Yet on June 14, 2016, Justin Trudeau said, “We do not feel that politicians should be weighing in on this first and foremost.”
At the height of the horrors in 2016, what was happening was condemned as a genocide by many official entities—by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, the U.S. House of representatives, the UK House of Commons and by a Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic.
ADs
Yet in June 2016, the Liberals voted against a Conservative-sponsored motion in the House of Commons that sought to condemn the actions of ISIS. Why was Trudeau reluctant to add his government’s witness to truth, given the general willingness in the international community to call this genocide what it was?
One reason might be that such a recognition would have triggered Regulation 138 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which defines vulnerable groups of people in urgent need of protection. A formal parliamentary recognition of genocide against the Yazidis would have obligated the Canadian government—morally, if not legally—to accept tens of thousands of Yazidi survivors to our shores.
Justin Trudeau was, however, from Day One fixated on rescuing Syrian Muslim refugees above all. As a result, actual genocide victims were forced to languish in exile from their homes in Mount Sinjar, reduced to rubble by ISIL, and who were still at risk from ISIL members in captivity, while 45,000 lightly-vetted Syrians from UNHCR camps, who had not been targeted for genocide, nor were in “urgent need of protection,” were whisked to Canada before Dec 31, 2015, by a marvellous coincidence permitting them to become citizens before this election.
ADs
Eventually, in October 2016, thanks largely to the persistent efforts of Michelle Rempel, Official Opposition critic for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, the Trudeau government did eventually vote to recognize the Yazidi situation as a genocide. But they never followed up on their pledge to bring in thousands of traumatized survivors. To date, of the estimated 500,000 Yazidis living in Iraq before the genocide, fewer than 1500 Yazidi survivors have been admitted to Canada.
All refugees suffer from culture shock, language barriers and other vulnerabilities. The Yazidis are exponentially more fragile. A number of the women are here with children, but no husbands or male kinsmen, because they were killed or their whereabouts undocumentable. They have endured sex slavery, some for years, and are near-paralyzed from PTSD. Illiteracy and poor schooling are common themes, because their culture is oral. None come speaking English.
Yet the government offered nugatory support. The dazed arrivals were expected to find housing on their own and learn enough English within the first year to find employment—a completely unrealistic expectation for these shell-shocked people. Were it not for the dedicated help of volunteers from groups such as Project Abraham, who help newcomers navigate the bewildering paperwork and simple tasks we take for granted, these people could not possibly integrate or even function. The bureaucracy has made it extremely difficult for kinsmen left behind, who could be a great moral support—sisters, nephews, in-law—to make application for reunion here.
ADs
Some of the stories these victims bring with them are heartbreaking. I interviewed one Yazidi woman, who had been a sex slave for 14 months, passed around amongst 13 different men. “Nada,” as I called her, had been living in London, Ontario for eight months when she recognized her former slave owner on a bus. Debarking, they stared at each other. She said he instantly covered his face and ran off. Nada went to the refugee centre, and told them what had happened. She gave an official there the man’s real name and also his ISIL name. Then, Nada told me, the official said to her, “Don’t tell anyone.”
After my account was published, there was a flurry of interest and dismay expressed at the idea of a jihadist having slipped through the vetting net. Nobody doubted he was the only one, either. I was contacted by the London Police Service. I referred them to Nada. To my knowledge, the man has not been found, even though it seems to me it shouldn’t have been that difficult to track him down.
It occurred to me that this would, for a prime minister obsessively focused on optics and photo opportunities that cast him in a benevolent light, have been a perfect opening for a gesture that would have endeared him to many Canadians. He could have contacted Nada, sat down with her, listened to her story (just as he listened to the story of Joshua Boyle and his wife on their return from captivity in Pakistan, for instance, bouncing their baby on his knee), promised to bring her tormenter to justice—and then, seen to it that justice was at least done to at least one ISIL member on Canadian soil. So easy. But no.
ADs
Mass graves of murdered Yazidis turn up every few weeks in Iraq, and 3,000 enslaved Yazidi women remain in captivity. Many Yazidis are now stuck in the new war zone that Turkey has just opened up in northern Syria. The Yazidi catastrophe was recognized as a genocide because of pressure brought to bear by the CPC. Will a Scheer government continue along the moral high road it embarked on, if it forms the next government? The fate of a devastated people depends on it.

Singh responded well to Trudeau’s blackface debacle and demonstrated a level of empathy that is rarely seen in a politician.
Singh also speaks in a way that makes him sound much more like a regular person, rather than the obviously scripted and over-practiced cadences of Trudeau and Scheer.
However, Singh has undone much of the goodwill he generated and has sadly revealed himself to be yet another divisive politician who has contempt for those who disagree with him.
During a recent press conference, Jagmeet Singh straight-up said: “We don’t respect Conservatives.”
“Good to know @theJagmeetSingh doesn’t respect conservatives. It’s why I won’t vote for him.  #cdnpoli I’d want a PM to respect all Canadians.”

Now, if Singh had said “we disagree with Conservatives,” or we will “campaign against Conservatives,” that wouldn’t be a problem.
After all, Singh is a socialist, and socialists generally aren’t big fans of Conservatives.
However, for Singh to go beyond opposition and disagreement, and to instead say he doesn’t “respect Conservatives,” is a disgrace.
A democracy cannot survive with some level of mutual respect. After all, we all have to live together after the election, and somehow find a way to keep our nation united after a divisive campaign.
Yet, with so many Canadians already rightfully outraged, and with our nation already dangerously divided, Singh’s comments are like throwing gasoline on the fire of those divisions.
If Singh doesn’t respect Conservatives, he’s actually saying he doesn’t respect millions of Canadians.
And if Singh doesn’t respect millions of Canadians, then why should Canadians respect him?
Really, if Singh doesn’t show respect, why should he get respect?
Making this even worse is that many Conservatives have spoken out favourably about Singh when he’s faced racism or prejudice. Singh has repaid that kindness and non-partisanship by saying that Conservatives aren’t worthy of his respect.
So, the next time Singh faces discrimination, millions of Canadians who would have otherwise defended him will justifiably say, “well, if he doesn’t respect us, then nobody should respect him, and he doesn’t deserve to be defended any longer.”
Singh had an opportunity to transcend some of Canada’s deepening partisan divisions, and help tamp down the growing anger and division in Canada. Instead, he has squandered that opportunity and made those divisions even worse."

Dear Ontario and Quebec voters,
On the eve of our Canadian Federal Election, I feel it is prudent to share with our fellow Canadians in the East how pivotal this election is for our Country.
I recognize a strong disconnect between the regions and believe I have a responsibility to share our feelings, perceptions, and fears with the men and women of these provinces.
It is no secret that the election is decided before the first vote is counted in Manitoba. 199 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons are held by your two provinces. Your votes decide our election.
This is why I am appealing to you. The fate of Canada and our incredible province of Alberta rests in your hands.
We’ve had a rough couple years out here. Since 2015 unemployment has soared, the price of our most valued resource has plummeted, and our access to foreign and domestic markets has been blocked by federal Liberals.
While this industry thrives south of the border in the US, Canada’s energy sector has been plunged into a ‘Legislated Recession’ thanks in part to the cancellation of 2 crucial pipelines and the poorly handled expansion of a third.
These projects are crucial, allowing access to foreign and domestic markets and closing the gap between the price of Canada’s oil and the oil produced elsewhere in the world.
The newly passed Bill C-69 makes new interprovincial projects nearly impossible to complete, and Bill C-48 restricts domestic tanker traffic on Canada’s West coast, while US tanker traffic navigates the same waters unimpeded. We’ve been put in a box, and the lid is slowly closing.
Our Federal Liberal government is the architect of this disaster.
You may ask why this should matter to you? It is simply a matter of economics. According to the Alberta government and World Bank websites, Alberta’s economy accounts for 20% of our Nation’s GDP. In this province of 4.7 million, it means that 11% of Canada’s population produces 20% of our GDP.
From 2000-2014, we contributed $200 Billion to equalization, all of it travelling East. On its own, Alberta is the 7th strongest economy on the planet.
We’re the core of this country’s economic engine. We’re being told our money is OK, but the oil, our largest economic driver is not. Hell, we can’t even wear our T-shirts on Parliament Hill.
Alberta’s oil is Canada’s oil, and there are a few facts I would like to share with you about it. We are at the forefront of the sector’s clean technology and everyone in this country should be proud of this industry and the highest environmental standards in the world.
During this election, I’m sure you’ve heard about O&G subsidies and how everyone intends on stopping them, so I feel it is important to break that down. Last year, there were $1.4 Billion dollars given to clean tech by our government. O&G received 75% of that. Rightfully so.
That money has been used to increase efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of production significantly and created technology that has eliminated the need for contentious tailings ponds. A recent study showed that if every country around the world produced their resources to the same standard as Canada, the carbon intensity of production would drop 26% worldwide.
Suncor, Canada’s largest producer, just announced a co-gen project that will reduce their carbon footprint by a further 30%, and we’ve championed cutting-edge carbon capture and storage technology. We would love to displace dirty foreign oil in the East, but we are told there is no social acceptability for a pipeline.
We would love to know why there is social acceptability for Saudi tankers in your waters, but none for us? Last I checked, Saudi didn’t contribute to equalization.
The environment has been a big topic in this election, and there have been some strong assertions from the parties, some of which may be a little out of reach. 30% reduction in GHG, 60% reduction in GHG.
The backbone of these reductions focuses on shutting Alberta’s economy down. There seems to be a huge target on Alberta’s back, and little red dots are starting to dance around the bullseye.
Canada contributes 1.6% to the world’s total GHG emissions. China contributes 27.2%, US 14.6%. A 30-60% reduction in Canada equates to a 1.8-3.6% reduction in China and a 3.5-7 % reduction in the US.
Al Gore once said that CO2 knows no borders, so rather than shut down the economic engine of our nation, why wouldn’t we export the clean energy and technology to the countries that need it the most, boosting our economy and helping everyone on this planet reach these targets?
What we do as Canadians to reduce emissions means nothing on the grand world scale. It is these heavy emitting countries that could benefit from Canada’s LNG to replace coal, and cleantech to further drive down emissions. It’s a win-win-win for Canada, the environment, and our economy.
The Conservatives have proposed this and it has been highly criticized as ‘not enough’. This is the most viable solution and environmental policy for everyone in this country, and it doesn’t include plunging the entire country into debt and recession. It is ironic that the one country (US) that pulled out of the Paris Agreement has made the most progress reaching that agreement’s targets. How? By doing exactly what the Conservatives have proposed to help us and other nations achieve: transitioning coal to significantly cleaner natural gas power generation.
There is another sentiment out here that likely resonates with our fellow Canadians from Quebec. If you asked the average Albertan if they would support separation 2 years ago, you’d be laughed at. Today it is no laughing matter. At the time of the provincial election only a few months ago, it was estimated that 50% of Albertans were open to separation. A poll of 6000+ Albertans only a week ago yielded the same results. We’ve been beaten into submission by the federal Liberals, and we continue to get kicked. Terms like ‘Western Alienation’, ‘Republic of Alberta’ and ‘Wexit’ have become very common.
All too often you see ‘Liberal on Oct 21, Separatist on Oct 22’. This movement is real. I mean, REAL. If another Liberal government is elected, even worse a Liberal minority with the Green or NDP propping it up, Alberta’s energy sector will just board up the windows and go elsewhere. It will be crippling for the entire nation. It is ALREADY crippling for Alberta. We can’t take any more of this.
We are the victims of a current Legislated Recession and it will only get worse. Half of us want to leave now. More will want to leave if we continue to be exploited for our revenue and vilified for our industry.
Alberta separation would be a crushing blow to this country and its economy, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Albertans are resilient, wholesome, hard-working people that have been happy to help our fellow Canadian citizens maintain a high standard of living. We’re only asking for reciprocation.
We don’t want hand-outs, tax revenue, or power. We want the right and ability to do what we’ve been doing all along, without having fellow Canadians standing in our way. We’re a part of the solution, not the problem.
Fellow Canadians, please consider this when casting your ballot. There’s a lot at stake for everyone.
There is a fragility in this nation that could be fractured with the stroke of a pen, and the power rests firmly in the hands of your provinces. Vote wisely. Vote Canadian.
Signed,
Alberta"

'Nobody tells Barack Obama what he should do': Speaking in Trois-Rivières, Que., Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau brushed off the notion that he asked for an endorsement from the former U.S. president.

Earlier this week, Obama took to Twitter to endorse and provide glowing praise of Justin Trudeau short of a week before Canadians decide who the next prime minister will be.
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 16, 2019
“I was happy to be able to work alongside Barack Obama on important issues around the globe, including, significantly, the fight against climate change, and I’m working really hard to be able to continue that work over the next four years,” Trudeau told reporters on Thursday.
“I was obviously happy to hear his words yesterday, but nobody tells Barack Obama what he should do.”
Shortly after the endorsement, many people raised the alarm that a foreign leader was endorsing Trudeau and encouraging Canadians to vote for him.
In response, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh claimed that Obama’s characterization was wrong.
“I’ve got a lot of respect for Mr. Obama, I think in this regard he is wrong,” said Singh."

In an electronic missive an Industry Canada employee received at work and shared with TPM—Public Service Alliance of Canada’s Political Action Officer Jill O’Reilly’s September 9, 2019 “special election bulletin”—the union specifically targets the Conservative leader.
“Andrew Scheer is going to pick up where Stephen Harper left off,” the email warns about “job cuts” and “working conditions.”
This despite the fact that under the current government, half of the union’s 140,000 federal employees remain without a collective agreement since June of 2018 as negotiations reached an impasse at the end of August.
While PSAC’s backdoor politicking appears to have run afoul of the rules, private sector cohort Unifor’s anti-Scheer campaign has been very public, despite the blatant conflict of interest—Unifor represents thousands of media workers in Canada who stand to benefit from Ottawa’s $600 million newspaper bailout.
We will #StopScheerStupidity ! @AndrewScheer https://t.co/TtyTFyDACn— Jerry Dias (@JerryPDias) November 14, 2018
According to Treasury Board Secretariat, the Public Service Alliance of Canada’s partisan messaging to members’ federal government email accounts has breached collective agreement terms.
“If political or partisan material is distributed by unions using government email networks or bulletin boards in government workplaces, this would be considered a contravention of the collective agreement,” said Treasury Board spokesperson Martin Potvin.
“In these cases, the employer would require the union to remove or recall the material.”
As of publication, Industry Canada (Innovation, Science and Economic Development) could not confirm whether the emails were authorized by the department or if dispensation was made in collective agreements; the only terms under which such communications would be sanctioned.
Meanwhile, the Public Service Commission warns forwarding such emails on to other colleagues would qualify as political activity under the Public Service Employment Act.
“Employees disseminating politically partisan material in the workplace, whether wittingly or unwittingly, is a political activity,” writes an unnamed commission’s spokesperson in an email to TPM.
“If the PSC receives an allegation that an employee performed such an activity, it may conduct an investigation. This investigation will determine whether this activity impaired or was perceived as impairing the employee’s ability to perform its duties in a politically impartial manner.”
O’Reilly, the Public Service Alliance of Canada’s Political Action Officer, did not respond to TPM’s request for comment on the matter, nor did several other union reps who were contacted for this story.
The Industry Canada employee who received the email and forwarded it to TPM expressed frustration that union politics continues to permeate federal workspaces.
“It’s such bullshit (PSAC) assume(s) everyone’s not conservative,” said the source who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation.
“It’s the union’s fault they don’t have a deal and now they go after a federal party that has nothing to do with it…more negotiating, less activism might help.”
While there appears no immediate, punitive recourse for PSAC’s political emails to federal employees, previous commission probes into federal employee abuses of the public trust for expressing political beliefs have resulted in sanctions and terminations.
Others, like Emilie Taman have prevailed in federal court under similar circumstances. In January of 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Public Service Commission lacked “justification, transparency and intelligibility” after it tried to prevent the former federal lawyer from running in the 2015 federal election.
Taman ignored the commission’s edict, took an unauthorized leave of absence to run under the NDP banner in Ottawa-Vanier and was subsequently fired (Taman is running again this year as New Democrat hopeful against Environment Minister Catherine McKenna in Ottawa Centre).
And also following the 2015 election cycle, federal scientist Tony Turner decided to retire rather than endure a public service commission investigation into his political activities that involved writing and performing his protest song, “Harperman”.
Turner had been suspended in the summer of 2015 for alleged breaches of the Public Servant Employment Act’s rules on the political activity of a federal employee."

“For breaking the Conflict of Interest Act not only once, but twice, Justin Trudeau faced absolutely no consequences. That’s because there are no consequences attached under the law,” said Scheer.
“A new Conservative government will introduce legislation for stiff penalties of up to $20,000 for violating the Conflict of Interest Act.”

Scheer revealed several new policy points during a campaign stop in Essex, Ontario, including new legislation meant to protect whistleblowers, laws preventing ministers from holding shares in companies that might benefit from legislative changes, and increasing restrictions on political lobbying.
“It’s all part of our 100-day action plan to show Canadians exactly how a new Conservative majority government will get to work right away to help them get ahead,” said Scheer.
While in power, Justin Trudeau was found to have broken ethics laws on two occasions, once when he accepted a trip and gifts from the Aga Khan, and another time when he was found to have attempted to interfere in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin.

First, even if Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives win more seats than the incumbent-Liberals, if it’s not the magic majority number of 170, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau retains first crack at forming a new government.
“It’s a complete fiction that whoever wins the most seats (in a minority) gets to form the new government – Trudeau’s the incumbent so he gets the ability to try and maintain confidence in the House.” explains Dale Smith, a parliamentary reporter in Ottawa and author of The Unbroken Machine; Canada’s Democracy in Action.
“He can do that by asking other parties to support him or he can enter into a formal arrangement, whether it’s to prop his government up, or a coalition which would involve having members of other parties involved in the cabinet, a less likelier possibility… he does not need to ask the Governor General’s permission to do that.”
Interestingly, a third-place finish for Trudeau would give him that ability as well, according to Smith, unless he concedes defeat or follows his father Pierre Trudeau’s famous footsteps into the snow.
“Trudeau would need to resign, or signal his intention to resign for (other parties) to cobble together whatever kind of agreement they would want and let the Governor General invite someone else, Scheer presumably, to form a government,” says Smith.
“But until Trudeau makes that decision, it’s his decision to make basically. It’s not the Governor General’s decision, it’s not Scheer’s decision.”
If Trudeau were to recall the House in a post-election minority situation – entirely within his purview as incumbent-PM – issue a Throne Speech and lose the subsequent confidence vote, resignation or asking the Governor General to dissolve parliament and plunge the country into another election remain options.
It is at this juncture that the Governor General retains the discretion to invite another party leader to form a government and test the House of Commons’ confidence.
Budget bills are also considered a “test of confidence” for sitting governments."

Today, former U.S. President Barack Obama thought it appropriate to endorse Justin Trudeau. If Trudeau had any care for the integrity of Canadian democracy, he would not recognize this endorsement at all. Of course, Justin Trudeau, as always, could not help himself.
Thanks my friend, we’re working hard to keep our progress going. https://t.co/l4V42PZbef— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) October 16, 2019
All politically-minded Canadians ought to follow this election with care, satisfied that the Government pledged in 2018 to combat foreign interference. This was not just any menial legislation, backed by obscure bureaucrats and tired politicians, but Justin Trudeau’s rallying cry against elite money.
Naturally, when Justin Trudeau sensed his power fading, these indignant shouts became less practical. And so, five years after legislation had been passed denouncing the rich for not paying their “fair share,” Trudeau’s party held a fundraising dinner in New York City to plead with wealthy American-Canadians for donations, breaking a Liberal transparency promise in the process.
This sort of hypocrisy rarely raises eyebrows in Canadian politics nowadays. When Trudeau breaks an ethics code for jetting off to the Aga Khan’s private island, it is our fault for not understanding that he has important friends. Or, when decade-old pictures emerge of a Trudeau in blackface, we should understand that everyone makes mistakes when they are young—not that this applied to a number of Conservatives who have had their careers destroyed through Liberal inspections of their social media.
Justin Trudeau evidently expects his cavalier style of governance to be acceptable for him and him alone. Our Prime Minister may even think it churlish of us not to consider himself above those electoral conventions. Indeed, why should we not let our dear Prime Minister off the grubbiness of minute rules? Why should we not just trust his infallible honesty, now alloyed by the lessons he learned from the blackface, Aga Khan, and SNC-Lavalin scandals?
In press scrums, Trudeau seems surprised that anybody still cares about this corruption. Such is the level of apathy that he has instilled in the voter.
It is rather boring, then, that Trudeau has again overruled conventional democratic practices and has (presumably) requested the support of President Obama. After five years of Trudeau, It is now difficult to become particularly outraged with yet another humiliation of the Canadian government.
That word, humiliation, is entirely fitting for Obama’s entrance into Canadian politics. It is, for example, starkly humiliating that Obama believes he is welcome or even has a right to suggest to us our next leader. In an election that has been a loss of innocence to the Candian public, President Obama’s intervention has been our bleakest moment.
Notwithstanding how patronizing this all is, there are some poignant questions to be considered.
Firstly, if the EU referendum and the French presidential election have proven anything, it is that Obama almost certainly did not praise Trudeau through his own accord. Perhaps Trudeau, who has previously taken a casual approach to this election, has begun to fear the Conservatives. This is especially unusual when taking into account that Trudeau (who has spoken strongly against this sort of thing) is so ready to accept, and indeed encourage Obama’s behaviour.
What does seem strange is that Trudeau would request Obama’s support in the first place. President Obama (who is now on his third endorsement since leaving office) has a rather unfortunate record of supporting doomed campaigns. Take, for instance, the European Referendum in the United Kingdom, where Obama told the British that they would be at the back of a “queue” for a trade deal with his United States. Fortunately, the United States was not his for much longer, and now the United Kingdom is perched happily at the front.
The only way Obama’s intervention will be of any significance this election would be if it provokes President Trump into a bit of one-upmanship, thereby encouraging Trump to endorse Andrew Scheer. If this happens, the PMO will almost certainly belong to Trudeau.
It is, nevertheless, vaguely confusing why Barack Obama would want to advocate for Trudeau at all. Trudeau’s track record of blackface, Nixonian corruption, and the mute pessimism that he fills Canadians with, makes him a dichotomy of the 2008 Obama. Perhaps the 2019 Obama may sympathize with Trudeau: once a great mobilizing figure turned into a symbol of frivolous modernity."

Any hedging, deception, vagueness, or other attempts to muddy the waters is very dangerous.
Unfortunately, both the Liberals and NDP are pushing Canada down a disturbing and potentially anti-democratic path, by refusing to either commit to a coalition or rule it out.
The Liberals and the NDP are hoping to see the results of the election and then make a decision after the votes have been counted, without giving the Canadian People a chance to vote on what may actually happen.
If the Liberals and NDP, for example, both explicitly announce that they would form a coalition government, and then win enough seats to do so, it would then be democratic for that coalition to happen.
This is because voters would be getting the truth about what could take place ahead of time. They would know that a vote for the Liberals might result in NDP policies being implemented. NDP voters would know that a vote for the NDP could result in Trudeau staying in power.
Canadians should be able to vote with a clear understanding that a coalition would take place. However, this is not how the Liberals and NDP are acting.
With Jagmeet Singh raising the prospect of a coalition only to then backtrack, and with Justin Trudeau’s repeated refusal of all questions on a coalition, the Liberals and NDP are both laying the groundwork for an anti-democratic government.
Many NDP supporters see the Liberals as corrupt and are adamantly opposed to Trudeau remaining in power. Yet, Singh’s refusal to be honest about a coalition is a betrayal to many of his supporters.
As for Trudeau, he is clearly hoping to remain in power, even if the Conservatives win more votes and more seats.
Canada is angry and divided now. If the Liberals and the NDP seize power through an unmentioned coalition, it will only get worse."

And after four years in power, Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are fully responsible for the state of politics in our country that exists under their leadership.
Now, the results of Trudeau’s time in power are clear:
Canada is more divided and angry than ever.
Justin Trudeau’s policies and his fear-based approach to politics has been full of misinformation, deception, and outright lies.
As a result, separatist sentiment is growing in both Western Canada and Quebec, and partisan rage is at an all-time high.
This is a direct result of Justin Trudeau’s repeated demonization of his political opponents, a point accurately noted by highly respected journalist Lorrie Goldstein:
“Um, I beg your pardon? Trudeau was the one who described Scheer as a white supremacist sympathizer and the entire Liberal campaign was based on fear and smear of the Conservatives as racists until Trudeau’s blackface scandal forced the Liberals to abandon it.”

Not only has Justin Trudeau ruthlessly demonized his political opponents, he’s also attempted to destroy the careers of anyone who stood up to him, as we saw with the horrible treatment of Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott.
Notably, a smear campaign seemingly launched from the Trudeau-PMO, featuring “anonymous” accounts tried to ruin Raybould’s reputation.
Trudeau is also directly responsible for the massive and likely irreversible rise of rampant cynicism in this country. By campaigning on an image that was so different from his actual persona, Justin Trudeau has taught an entire generation of Canadians that no politician can ever be trusted.
Consider the fact that Trudeau campaigned as a “feminist,” as a supporter of ‘reconciliation,’ and as the most ‘woke’ person possible. Yet, what he delivered was a government of the elites, by the elites, and for the elites, as he gave preferential treatment to big, well-connected corporate entities, treated strong women in the Liberal cabinet like trash, and was hiding his repeated blackface escapades the entire time.
That kind of blatant hypocrisy and deception is something that millions of Canadians will never forget, and it has massively increased the political division and anger in this country.
So, when Justin Trudeau tries to complain about polarization and anger in Canada, he’s purposely trying to distract from the fact that he is the one who has created this polarization and anger, and his rhetoric has put Canadians, and potentially his political opponents, at risk in this environment of anger, chaos, and division.
Unfortunately, Trudeau’s “legacy” will be with us for a long time, as the divisions he’s created are certain to last for years, and potentially even decades."

Currently, dozens of civilians alongside hundreds of soldiers have reportedly been killed in Turkey’s offensive to create a “safe-zone” within North-Eastern Syria, with another 160,000 being displaced.

While the attack against the Kurds are worrying, the regional implications could be even more devastating.
For example, the Kurds manage the al-Hol camp, an area home to roughly 70,000 individuals, of which 30,000 still swear fealty to the Islamic State.

Already there are reports of ISIS re-organizing in preparation as al-Hol camp guards continue to receive fewer and fewer resources in the face of Turkish assaults.
In response to the growing chaos in the region, it appears some nations are beginning to act in a limited fashion.
According to the National Post, Global Affairs Canada has confirmed that Canada has “temporarily” suspended new arms export to Turkey.
“This unilateral action risks undermining the stability of an already fragile region, exacerbating the humanitarian situation and rolling back progress achieved by the Global Coalition Against Daesh, of which Turkey is a member,” said spokesman Guillaume Berube.
“We call for the protection of civilians and on all parties to respect their obligations under international law, including unhindered access for humanitarian aid.”
Britan, Germany, and France have also suspended arms sales, while the United States has initiated sanctions targetting the Turkish economy.
While sanctions are sure to hurt the Turkish economy, the willingness for Kurdish allies such as the United States to rapidly withdraw support is sure to further destabilize the region, as fewer countries rely on American promises and even fewer potentially fear American arms."

While a stoic, orange-shirted man would block her way, a woman would scream “Nazi scum off our streets!” point-blank in her face, horrifying the millions of Canadians that would go on to watch the footage over the coming days.
The internet, consumed with fury, would immediately mobilize in an attempt to identify those who committed such an atrocious act against on a senior was such a clear representation for so many Canadians’ own grandmothers. And on October 2nd, the man in the orange shirt was identified as Alaa Al-Soufi. It didn’t take long for his family, proprietors of Soufi’s restaurant in Toronto, to be found.
It was on this day that Alaa’s father, Husam Al-Soufi, first heard about what happened at Mohawk College. “Before that, I did not know what antifa was…” He says, “I had not even heard of it.”
The Al-Soufi patriarch and I began speaking after he politely requested I remove a post I had made that had generated quite a bit of attention on my personal Twitter. Husam became anxious over a screenshot I had included from an older Toronto-area foodie article which revealed the name of one of his sons’ Universities. “I don’t blame you, Anna,” he said, but his fear was palpable.
He lit up when I offered to delete my post, thanking me with a little heart emoji when I offered to contact the news outlet who had published information about his son on his behalf to request that they delete or edit the article of the potentially revealing information.
While my post had been critical of the Soufi’s, and generally dismissive of the air of virulence that had emerged on both sides of their situation, speaking with Husam instilled in me a new appreciation for his family by showing me a side the media had not covered. I took the opportunity to pick Husam’s brain about what happened that day, offering him an audience that was likely full of his biggest disparagers. But only wanting to foster dialogue, Husam jumped at the opportunity.
“We just want to wake up from this nightmare,” Husam said. “I hate politics.”
After his daughter notified him about what she saw on social media, Husam says he was incredulous. “I was so ignorant about what was happening. I thought antifa was anti-fascist—[that’s] anti-Hitler, anti-terrorist. I had no idea it happened in Hamilton. I had no idea about Mr. Maxime’s speech.”
Husam says he knew his son was politically active, but that he demonstrated for causes he believed to be right. “For Hong Kong, Tibet, Venezuela … He does volunteer work, he is a sweet young man. This time he did a mistake.” After finding out about the incident at Mohawk, Husam reviewed past footage of Alaa’s demonstrations and activities, only then becoming aware that they had become physical at various points. According to his father, Alaa has been extremely ill recently, so much so that he’ll be taking time off of university to recover.
I asked Husam if Alaa knew who the woman who screamed at Dorothy Marston, and he said that his son had never met her before. He also said he and Marston’s son, Davis, have sat down, and he hopes to have the opportunity to apologize to the elderly woman in person. “I pray it will happen. And when I say pray, I usually look at a beautiful thing and make a wish. Usually, this beautiful thing is my wife.”
On freedom of speech, Husam agreed it was a fundamentally Canadian value, even going to far as to believe people had a right to be upset over how Dorothy Marston was prevented from safely entering Mohawk College.
“She is a lovely senior lady and my son blocked her way. Wearing a scary mask is not something we should accept. It is legal but immoral.”
When the conversation shifted to antifa, Husam believed they might have good goals, but the wrong methods.
“I don’t know much about them, but I will say this … Even if their intentions are to serve and protect marginalized communities, they are going about them the wrong way.” He suggested to his son that they should be giving out flyers and handing out flowers to people. Peaceful methods to win over the hearts of people, not “shouting and wearing masks.”
Husam says his decision to close the restaurant was hasty, but only in hopes of diffusing the situation. In doing so, he found himself stuck in the middle of an even worse situation.
“I thought I would give a victory to angry people, and the threats would stop coming. I was wrong.” He says, “But then people on ‘the other side’ told me I was giving up hope for newcomers. I was in the middle. I was on no one’s side!”
Currently, Soufi’s is being managed by Paramount Foods while Husam and his wife care for Alaa and their own health. Husam noted he is unsure of when he will return to his restaurant, feeling unconvinced reopening was the right decision to begin with.
“When I closed the restaurant my decision was final, but I was under so much pressure from a lot of people,” Husam says, “I felt like I didn’t want to be the one to discourage new immigrants or refugees.”
Husam says he never intended for notoriety, or to become a symbol of anything, least of all resistance towards some racist bogeyman. Through and through, he demonstrated he was a simple man who only sought to run a quaint Syrian restaurant in his new country—a country he came to as an investor immigrant, mind, not a refugee as many had wrongly claimed. The stress this situation has brought seems to have genuinely taken its toll on him.
“Canada is my home until I die,” Husam says, noting that he loves and admires Canadian values. A civil engineer, Husam says he has much larger projects he is able to pursue, but his Soufi’s was his ‘baby,’ and he had been floored by its success. “My restaurant introduced me to Canadian people. [It was] a place where we could talk and laugh. We felt at home after this restaurant. We knew people of all ethnicities, religions, and cultures.”
When I asked him if he had any final words for the article, he reiterated a sentiment he had repeated many times throughout our conversation, once before he said he forgave everyone who had said something cruel or threatening towards his family, and once more when he was reflecting on antifa:
“Love is our only hope!”"

The shocking revelation came on Sunday morning when Yetman, feeling sick, visited doctors who informed her that she had cancer. Just five days later, her family was informed that the cancer was incurable and untreatable.
Yetman decided to use the last moments on earth to pursue a noble goal: promoting democracy. In a video posted to social media, Yetman urges Canadians to vote for the election in the video saying “If I can find the time, you can find the time.” The young Winnipeg is the niece of Global News Winnipeg station manager Brett Williamson, who helped her create the video, reports Global News.

Williamson said this about his niece: “Maddison’s always been very politically active, right from junior high on, she had very strong views … she believes in the process as well and was looking forward to voting. She was lecturing us all on the pros and cons of the different parties in her eyes.”
The message that Yetman wishes to get across is that if she has the time to vote in the few remaining minutes she has, other Canadians can make the time.
Global News has attempted to create a campaign for Madison where on voting day, they will urge voters to take a photo of themselves after voting and publish it to social media with the hashtag #VotedForMaddison."

The figures show that roughly 4.7 million Canadians checked their ballots nationwide over the weekend. Only 3.6 million Canadians had cast their ballots during that same span over 2015’s federal election.
“More and more, Canadians are taking advantage of early voting opportunities to cast their ballots,” Chief Electoral Officer Stephane Perrault said in a news release. “I want to thank returning officers for their careful planning and the thousands of election workers who made that possible.”
With advance voter turnout being as high as it is, we can still only speculate as to if overall voter turnout will surpass the 2015’s numbers.
The 2015 election saw more people head to the poll booths than the six prior elections with voter turnout rising sharply in 2015 to 68.5 percent of eligible voters, the highest turnout since 1993.
This time around, high voter turnout could be seen as a sign of potential trouble for the incumbent Trudeau government, though.
Take for example the last three provincial elections in Ontario. During the 2011 Ontarian election, fewer than half of all eligible Ontarians cast their ballots and the incumbent Liberals returned to power. Voter turnout again was low in 2014, as Liberals stayed in office, this time with Wynne as their leader.
When 2018 rolled around, voter turnout was at its highest in nearly 20 years, resulting in Liberal defeat and a Conservative majority government in the province.
Since Canadian Confederation, governing parties get re-elected at the federal level more frequently when voter turnout is at its lowest. Previous elections show that nearly two-thirds of cases abide by this pattern, and according to The Globe and Mail, voter turnout drops by 0.8 percent when voters return a federal government to power.
“In the nine elections with drops in turnout of 5 percent or more, the government was re-elected six times. And in only two of the elections since 1926 with a drop in turnout did the incumbent government not come out victorious.”
Though not a rule that is set in stone, history indicates that high voter turnout is a problem worth worrying about for sitting governments, and high advanced numbers could be an indicator that power could change hands in next week’s election."

It isn’t clear from the video how many people Kathrada was speaking to or how convinced they were by the cleric’s speech.
Canadian Cleric Younus Kathrada: All Candidates in Upcoming Elections are Evil, Filthy Non-Muslims Who Support Homosexuality, Zionism pic.twitter.com/wqEOCf1vJ4— MEMRI (@MEMRIReports) October 15, 2019
He began with the intent of dissuading Muslims from voting in the election, saying that they will be judged by Allah for voting for “evil” candidates who support homosexuality and Jewish sovereignty over Israel.
“With regards to these elections,” Kathrada begins, “let me say one thing: if you are planning on voting, then remember that there are two angels on your shoulders recording everything that you do and say.”
“This voting is a testimony and it will be recorded.”
“On Judgment Day, you will stand before Allah and be asked about it. If you plan on voting… Ask yourself, prepare the answer first – what am I going to tell Allah when Allah asks me: “You voted for that filthy non-Muslim. Why?”
Calling non-Muslims “filthy” is a common motif throughout Kathrada’s rhetoric, specifically, he targets those who support LGTB activities, as well as those in support of maintaining diplomatic relations with Israel.
“He or she approves of homosexuality,” Kathrada continues, “which Allah declared forbidden from above the seven heavens. You think that they want good for you? I already told you what Allah said: “Never will they [Jews and Christians] be pleased with you.” They will continue to oppose you. You are fighting a losing battle. They are all evil. Every single one of them.”
He concludes with a final denouncement, saying that voting will not aid Muslims in any way.
“There may be some rare circumstance, where we would say, “Okay, voting may benefit us.” This is not one of them,” Kathrada says. “They are all evil and filthy.
“Do you know that every one of them, without exception, supports Zionists against Islam and the Muslims?” he finally asks.
Sheik Younus Kathrada has previously been under an investigation after allegations of hate crimes were put forward over racial slurs against Jews."

Answer: When Liberal partisans suddenly start flooding social media with “reminders” that actually election results don’t matter and actually a prime minister gets to stay in office regardless of what happens on voting day.
Over the last couple of days various Liberal hacks and left-leaning media personalities, including Bob Rae, Rosemary Barton (perceptions of being non-partisan be damned now apparently) and Aaron Wherry have been repeatedly retweeting pundits claiming that it would be totally normal and not weird at all if Justin Trudeau stayed on as prime minister after losing the October 21 election to Andrew Scheer. “It’s literally how the parliamentary system works,” Barton incorrectly asserted on Twitter.
The argument is that even if Scheer wins more seats, Trudeau, as incumbent prime minister has the absolute right to stay in office until the next time parliament reconvenes. Which, in theory, could be months after the election, since—conveniently!—the prime minister decides when parliament sits. All the constitution says is that it can’t be delayed more than a year.
During those months, Trudeau could be free to use the powers of his office any way he feels like. He could make any unilateral decision he wanted to relating to foreign policy, immigration, pipelines, etc. He could also spend months promising the farm to Jagmeet Singh in the hopes the NDP will agree to approve his usurpation-like power-grab.
No prime minister has attempted to cling to power in this way in over 94 years. The last time was in 1925, when Liberal prime minister Mackenzie King lost the 1925 election to the Conservatives, and continued to rule for seven months until he tried to call another election and the governor-general fired him, causing the King-Byng crisis.
Every other time, however, the transfer of power from one prime minister to another has been quick and easy, even in minority government situations.
Liberal prime minister Louis St. Laurent surrendered power to John Diefenbaker when the Conservatives won a minority government in 1957. Pierre Trudeau handed power to Joe Clark when the Conservatives won a minority in 1979. Paul Martin conceded defeat when Stephen Harper won a minority government in 2006.
So what makes Justin Trudeau so special? Why are his supporters and so-called journalists acting like he has a right to break 94 years of tradition and exploit constitutional loopholes too cling to power even after losing?
It’s obvious that there are a lot of powerful interests in this country who can’t handle the idea that their Liberal gravy train might be coming to a screeching halt. That’s why Trudeau’s fanboys and girls in politics and the media are all of a sudden trying to normalize crazy schemes in an effort to get the public to accept that a Conservative minority government has no right to take power, and Trudeau should be able to do what no Liberal prime minister before him ever dared to do—violate the will of the people."
0,2019-10-15T08:28:44.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/scheer-mediocrity-why-the-cpc-leader-is-completely-uninspiring,SCHEER MEDIOCRITY: Why the CPC leader is completely uninspiring,"Allow me to break the fourth wall for a moment as I start off this column: in my piece “Why I’m voting Liberal,” I paraphrased Sir Winston Churchill to argue that Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is a “modest man who has much to be modest about.”
The Post Millennial editors asked if I would expand on that suggestion. Here goes.
This weekend over Thanksgiving dinner, both my poppa, dad and great uncle were quite clear that they do not like Justin Trudeau one bit. They should be prime Conservative voters, demographically speaking. But are they enthusiastic to go vote Tory? Not in the slightest; “I guess I have to vote PC,” they said. They say Scheer seems like “a kid” or “weak,” or most devastating in their minds, “not much better than Trudeau.”
Similarly, when I ask my Tory buddies—even some who work on Conservative campaigns or for Premier Doug Ford—about Mr. Scheer, they all say variations on a theme: he’s boring, not up to the task, soy boy (whatever that means).
So let’s dispense with the obvious: Scheer is a career politician who oddly served as the nonpartisan Speaker, only to go back to party politics to run for leader. That, and then there’s the whole business about relocating to Saskatchewan after a stint as a staffer on the Hill, and the whole embellishing about being an insurance broker, when he was not one (of all the qualifications to fudge—the guy in Catch Me If You Can at least had the sense and imagination to fake being a pilot).
The bigger issue, though, is Scheer lacks a compelling alternative vision to Prime Minister Trudeau. His strategy seems based more on voters tiring of Trudeau, not on actually presenting a programme that could persuade people to change their vote.
Call it a base play, or timidity.
What is Scheer offering Canadian voters? A few boutique tax credits from the Harper playbook, the cancellation of the carbon tax and not being Justin Trudeau. For maybe 30 percent of the population, that is more than enough, sign me up.
But for the vast majority of Canadians, simply “not being Justin Trudeau” is insufficient. They want something to vote for, something that speaks to their real anxieties. To 70 percent of the population, Scheer’s agenda of not fighting the climate crisis and spending cuts is anathema.
Throughout this campaign, even as Trudeau faced significant challenges such as the blackface controversy, Scheer has been unable to capitalize, unable to grow beyond his 30 percent base.
His failure to put forward any programme to fight climate change is clearly a dealbreaker for many Canadians; no doubt that is why the Liberals have focused so heavily on the issue. Moreover, Scheer is seemingly nowhere on the major social contract issues we are facing in this area of economic disruption, automation and darkening geopolitics.
Scheer is offering small-ball politics, when the issues and challenges people face—from the climate crisis to the lack of workplace benefits in the gig economy—require bolder, broader solutions.
What is the Conservative plan to lower the cost of prescription drugs? How will Tories deal with precarious work and the lack of pension and other benefits? What is the Conservative solution to traffic gridlock? How will Tories address AI and automation to protect workers? Scheer is largely silent on these major challenges. Even on deficits, his plan to balance the books is years away and a pipedream without major cuts.
There is a small-C conservative approach to tackling these big questions of economic change, the cost of living and the climate crisis, but Scheer’s trying to play error-free, uninspiring hockey, rather than setting out to win the game. Again, he thinks Trudeau will defeat himself, which is a variation on the classic blunder of underestimating your opponent.
Added to this timidity in terms of policy is the fact that even Conservative voters find Scheer lacklustre—can anyone realistically imagine Scheer standing up to Donald Trump?—and you have a recipe for an uninspiring offering to the voters.
For all his flaws as a blowhard playing footsie with racists, at least Maxime Bernier would have presented a clear contrast with Trudeau’s vision; even if the vision Bernier offered was dead wrong, at least it exists.
Or, to quote another timid conservative figure, George HW Bush, Scheer lacks “the vision thing,” and as the proverb says, “Where there is no vision, the people perish.”
They say that history does not repeat itself but it does rhyme. It’s intriguing to think that here we are yet again in this country with the bloom off the rose of Trudeaumania but a tepid and milquetoast Conservative leader is unable to capitalize."

According to Global News, Singh believes this policy would deliver better democratic representation to Canadians.
Despite the abolition of the senate being a traditional NDP rallying cry, this issue has received cross-party support as many Canadians feel the senate only adds expensive and often inconsequential delay to the passing of legislation.
In 2014, for example, $67.9 million in taxpayer dollars was spent on the salaries and bonuses of Senators.
Singh, however, believes that partisanship is the most grievous fault of the Senate. The NDP leader stated that senators represent the interests of the political parties, and not the Canadian public; especially those from smaller provinces.
In the 2015 election,  Justin Trudeau promised to remedy partisanship in the Senate and invoked reforms to achieve this. Nevertheless, critics still consider the Senate to be a partisan body.
The NDP will propose to work with the provinces to remove what their party considers an undemocratic and costly institution."

The move to look bluer and less Trudeau is not surprising when you consider that Thornhill has voted Conservative since 2008, with MP Peter Kent receiving no less than 49% of the vote in any of those elections.
None the less, the move from red to blue, deeply highlights the level of campaign instability that could be occurring in some liberal ridings across the country as the race tightens, and a Liberal or Conservative minority becomes the most likely outcome.

It wants to compete with Netflix, private news companies, and broadcasters to be the chief Canadian content provider.
To truly do that though, the CBC would have to function as a media producer that represents all Canadians.
With only one week until the election ends, they have blown that opportunity by not just blurring the line between partisanship and journalism, but erasing it altogether.
For those catching up, the state broadcaster will be taking the Conservative Party of Canada to court for using clips of the broadcaster’s footage in an online attack ad, something other parties also do, but CBC decided to single out the Conservatives.
Stunningly and stupidly tone-deaf, the CBC named Rosemary Barton and John Paul Tasker as applicants in the copyright infringement lawsuit, but are now planning to amend it to remove both journalists’ names after facing serious backlash from the public and experts alike.
Part of the public outrage came from the fact that court documents show the CBC began sending letters to the Conservative Party on October 7th.
That was the same day that the only official English Leaders’ debate was moderated in part by CBC journalist Rosemary Barton.
At this moment, it’s not clear whether Barton was involved since then, or if this was handled without their knowledge. But lawyers not involved in the case are saying it’s pretty hard to believe Barton wasn’t involved in the lawsuit where she was named as one of the applicants. Either way, there’s a serious problem.
If CBC journalists Barton, co-host of The National, and Tasker were aware of the lawsuit it would mean Barton co-moderated the leaders’ debate while not disclosing to the public she was suing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s party.
If they were unaware, the CBC was so trigger happy that it initiated a suit including named applicants without the knowledge or consent of the journalists.
Both cases are worrying. And this is just the beginning.
According to an article published in the Globe and Mail by lawyer Michael Geist, “the lawsuit is all the more puzzling because the legal claims are quite weak. The majority of the seven clips do not even include CBC journalists. Three are taken from the English-language leaders’ debate and one from a town-hall meeting with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau. Of the remaining clips, Ms. Barton says nothing in one, and the others run for a total of 10 seconds.”
Interestingly, while the CBC continues to sue the Conservatives for copyright infringement, according to a 2018 Canadaland report, the state broadcaster itself remains mired in its own legacy of stealing scoops from small private Canadian content producers without giving credit.
Regardless of the hypocrisy, the CBC has also been quick to attack and criticize independent journalism in this country, often labelling it as unserious or lacking credentials.
Indeed, Barton even had the nerve to tweet out the suggestion that not all journalists are real journalists.
It was a clear swipe at Andrew Lawton of TNC who had to force the government’s hand by getting last-minute court-ordered accreditation after being targeted, blocked, and harrassed by Trudeau’s campaign as well as the Trudeau government-appointed Leaders’ Debate Commission. Once a federal court judge ordered the commission to give Lawton accreditation, a CBC journalist allegedly conspired with one of Trudeau’s aides to try and stop Lawton from asking Trudeau a question.

Journalism is a critical part of democracy. And just because someone says they are a journalist doesn’t make them so.— Rosemary Barton (@RosieBarton) October 11, 2019
The embarrassing news of Barton’s involvement in CBC’s lawsuit dropped one day later, and the subsequent removal of her name and denial she was involved followed after her and CBC got blasted on Twitter. This begs the question: why do so-called real journalism outlets launch frivolous copyright suits against a particular political party mere days before an election without disclosing it to their audience?
Then there’s the fake news propaganda CBC routinely spreads, too. With so much Liberal pamphleteering, it’s no wonder why Canadians are turning away from the CBC to independent alternatives."

The aim of the policy is to make the process of adopting a child more affordable and less of a financial barrier for parents or soon-to-be parents. The Conservatives are promising to introduce 15 weeks of EI (Employment Insurance) adoption leave benefits for Canadians who adopt a child under the age of 18, either domestically or internationally.
The Tories are also promising to amend the Income Tax Act by boosting the Adoption Expense Tax Credit to $20,000 and make it “fully refundable.” The current law has that maximum figure at $15,905.
Such a move would provide Canadians in the lower-income brackets with a healthy tax return of nearly the full amount (over the course of a few years) should they choose to adopt a child.
Under current law, the maximum tax savings an adoptive family could receive is $2,482 but under the Conservative’s new proposal, that could increase by $518 a year to $3,000. Such amounts will continue to increase in accordance with the Consumer Price Index, as is the current policy.
Speaking on the new policy proposal, Sweet stated “Every year, thousands of Canadians adopt a child. By opening their homes and their hearts, these families provide stability, love, and a brighter future for some of the most vulnerable in Canada and around the world.”
“Adoption is one of the most selfless things a Canadian can do. At the same time, it can also involve significant investments of time and money. Andrew Scheer will make it easier for Canadians to begin, expand, or complete their family through adoption.”
The PBO (Parliamentary Budget Office) estimates that these two policies combined will cost taxpayers around 12-13 million dollars per fiscal year, far less than even one percent of the federal government’s budget in 2019.
Ruth Shaw, the president of the National Campus Life Coalition (NCLN), who herself was adopted from India by her Canadian parents, praised the policy in a Facebook video sponsored by Conservative Candidate Garnett Genuis (Sherwood Park-Fort Saskatchewan).
“I’m very excited to see the Conservatives do something so overtly pro-life by trying to reform the adoption process. It’s one of the most pro-life things I’ve seen any party do.”
“I think that this is an area that we [Canada] could lead in, that we can make it easier for people to adopt and therefore increase the love and the care that adoptees get. They deserve so much love and care and they need it. I think Canada would be a great place to start making that journey a little bit easier.”
The Liberals, for their part, also have a similar policy in their platform as well, where they promise to give a 15 week leave to adoptive parents. This promise did not contain any specific costing analysis, however.
None of the other major parties have any adoption-related policies in their platforms."

“To be clear, CBC/Radio Canada was the driver of this process, not the journalists” reads part of the CBC statement that mentions removing the journalists’ names as plaintiffs. “CBC/Radio Canada named and added the journalists to the application because their images and content were used inappropriately.”
Lawyers uninvolved in the lawsuit but observing the situation believe it is highly doubtful that the CBC journalists were not aware they were applicants in the lawsuit.
“In a multi-party retainer situation there is a checklist the lawyers have to go through including advising clients of potential for conflict of interest as between clients,” said Toronto based litigation lawyer and Governor of the Law Society of Ontario Jared Brown to The Post Millennial. “It’s not likely that a major law firm failed that step.  But if they did proceed without authorization, it could be professional misconduct, and the lawyers could be personally required to pay a costs order.  This says nothing of the horrible optics of the [public ] broadcaster suing a political party in the midst of a campaign.”
If CBC journalists Barton, co-host of The National, and Tasker were aware of the lawsuit it would mean Barton co-moderated the leaders’ debate while not disclosing to the public she was suing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer’s party.
The copyright infringement notice was sent to CPC reps hours before the debate.

“Rosemary and John Paul will continue to cover the election,” said CBC’s public affairs head Chuck Thompson to The Post Millennial Sunday.
“…CBC/Radio Canada was the driver of this process, not Rosemary Barton or John Paul Tasker. We named and added them to the application because their images and journalism were misused for partisan purposes, negatively impacting perceptions of their independence.”
Thompson also cited previous copyright lawsuits CBC filed against CPC and NDP think tank The Broadbent Institute.
“And that happened during the 2015 election campaign when we sued the Conservative Party as well as The Broadbent Institute for the same reasons we took legal action last Thursday.”
Thompson did not provide any other examples of other federal political parties being sued or sent cease and desist letters for using CBC content, which federal parties also routinely do.
Many high-profile critics and experts have spoken out on social media saying CBC’s lawsuit is far more damaging for the credibility of the journalists and public broadcaster than CPC’s use of short CBC clips.

Barton in the past has repeatedly been accused by Conservatives of being partial for the Trudeau Liberals. Months after Trudeau became prime minister she thought it was appropriate to take a selfie with him and post it on social media. Recently she has made subjective comments favouring Trudeau and his party live on air, including dismissing the large deficits the Liberals have run and the RCMP are “just asking a few questions” about Trudeau and his staff’s involvement in potential judicial interference in the SNC Lavalin case.
The Canadian Twitterverse erupted on Saturday over the news CBC is suing the CPC. #DefundCBC was a top trending topic for the greater part of the day. The offending CPC attack video was shared widely on social media, one copy receiving over 750,000 views.

“The Conservative Party has grave concern that this decision was made on the eve of an election that CBC is to be covering fairly and objectively,” the CPC said in a statement. “The Conservative Party considers this a complete distraction in the final days of tightly contested election, and we will dispute this lawsuit fully.”
The party’s statement also said, “When you are funded entirely by taxpayer dollars, taxpayers should be able to use the footage.”
Barton’s predecessor at The National and mentor Peter Mansbridge came to his handpicked successor over the weekend on Twitter.
“A ridiculous situation at the CBC this weekend. @rosiebarton being targeted by trolls for something she had nothing to do with while CBC lawyers who engineered this mess enjoy their weekend.”
In 2015 Mansbridge sent an email to the head of CBC news complaining about a CPC attack ad that used a clip of an interview he did with Justin Trudeau in which the Conservatives used Trudeau’s comments on the Boston Bombing. His complaints led to a lawsuit against the Conservatives. When Trudeau was sworn-in as PM Mansbridge was ridiculed for his fawning exclusive interview with him. He also had his close friend and Liberal partisan Bruce Anderson giving political analysis (i.e. Liberal spin) for years on The National.
Other news broadcasters’ clips were used in the CPC attack ad but they have yet to file lawsuits against the party."

The activity of the candidates was first discovered by B’nai Brith Canada, who has been tracking the activity of the “Ontario-based Arabic-language newspaper” al-Forqan.
One NDP candidate, Brian Masse, and three Liberal candidates, Sandra Pupatello, Irek Kusmierczyk, and Audrey Festeryga all advertised with this newspaper, which has continually advocated for political Jihad and the need to bomb Israel.
“In 2016, B’nai Brith exposed an editorial in al-Forqan that praised terrorist attacks in Israel as a “sacred duty of jihad.” This prompted the Multicultural Council of Windsor and Essex County to cut ties with Mohammed Khalifeh, al-Forqan’s Managing Director,” writes B’nai Brith Canada.
This is the same newspaper that found it appropriate to publish “The Hour [of Judgment] will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them” and lines such as “Lying is an attribute inherent to the Jews!”
The other newspaper is the Toronto-based al-Meshwar, which has also praised terrorist attacks and openly advocated for the elimination of Jews.
Scarborough Centre MP Salma Zahid had been advertising with al-Meshwar, saying that he was completely unaware of such posts and advocacy and will never advertise with them again, reports B’nai Brith Canada."

“His party’s plan calls for cutting subsidies to oil and gas companies as a way to encourage a transition to renewable energy sources — part of a general pledge shared by the NDP, Greens and Liberals to cut emissions over the coming years,” reported Global News.
In response to the backlash over this plan, Singh has promised to assist workers in finding new employment opportunities appropriate for their skills with government revenue generated from increasing taxes on people making over $20 million.
Historically speaking, the rich tend to move their money and themselves to different jurisdictions when governments’ raise taxes suddenly and significantly.
He also suggested hiring the unemployed oil and gas workers for various government housing projects the NDP has planned in its platform.
“These are ways for people with the skills in the resource sector to put those to use in other sectors,” Singh said.
“We can make that happen. It’s about commitments, it’s about having the courage to do it and we’re ready to do it.”
Singh also admitted that he’s heard the concerns of Albertans who would feel wronged should his plans be put into action. During a speech in Toronto, he recalled one such conversation with an engineer and son of an oil sands worker.
“And he says, ‘I’m going through the same thing my dad went through. I’m also facing now the fear of losing my job,’” Singh said.
“So, no matter how hard people work in resource sectors, through no fault of their own — because of international, global markets, as commodities go up and down — people go through busts and booms. People deserve better than that. The good people of Alberta deserve better than that.
“So, my commitment is this: I want to invest into programs and an economy that’s more sustainable, that’s more long-lasting.”"

Singh made the announcement in a Liberal-held riding in Surrey, B.C. amid the Liberals arguing that the only way voters can prevent a Conservative government is to vote Liberal. Singh assured voters that he will support a coalition to prevent Scheer from becoming prime minister with a minority government.
“We’re not going to support a Conservative government,” Singh said. “We’re going to fight a Conservative government, we’re going to fight it all the way. We’re ready to do whatever it takes.”
This tactic could help the NDP retain its base following the election, assuring NDP voters that they don’t need to strategically vote Liberal in order to prevent a Scheer victory. Singh said that the NDP would “absolutely” work with the Liberal Party, Bloc Quebecois, and Green party on a coalition government.

On the campaign trail, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau warned left-wing voters against casting their ballot for the NDP.
“We’ve seen what happens in places like Ontario,” Trudeau said. “The NDP wasn’t able to stop Doug Ford. The NDP wasn’t able to stop Stephen Harper. If you want to stop Conservative cuts you have to elect a progressive government, not a progressive opposition.”
“Do we give in to the polarization and the fear and the division and the misinformation being spread online,” he continued, “or do we continue to move forward, pushing back against Conservative cuts and choose a progressive government that is going to continue investing in people and continue fighting climate change.
“I think it’s very clear that Canadians are worried about what a Conservative government would do.”
Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet says that he has no interest in forming a coalition government with anyone, stating that his party represents Quebec’s interests, not the Liberal’s or NDP’s.
“There will be no support for a government, for a party, for a coalition or anything of the sort,” Blanchet said in French during a campaign stop on Sunday.
“We speak exclusively for Quebec and our friendships are more within Quebec than with the other parties in Ottawa.”
Regardless, an NDP-Liberal or NDP-Green-Liberal coalition would be more than enough to swing things in the Liberal Party’s favour, and the Bloc Quebecois wouldn’t be needed.
Conservative spokesman Simon Jefferies said the Conservatives are staying positive in the wake of Singh’s announcement.
“The Conservative campaign has been positively sharing our plan to put more money in the pockets of Canadians so they can get ahead,” Jefferies said in a written statement. “We have also been reminding voters about Justin Trudeau’s record and explaining how he will continue to make life more expensive if re-elected.”"

Trudeau eventually did make it onto the stage, greeting a large crowd of Liberal supporters, as heavy RCMP and Mountie presence ensured safety at the event.
Following the event, many took to social media to denounce the potential threat of violence against a national leader.
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh tweeted that “any threat made against Justin Trudeau, or any leader, is troubling to all of us.”

Comm. Dwayne McDonald fired back at people who have criticized RCMP officers in Surrey and the plausibility of a full Surrey Police Force swaying RCMP officers to leave for the force.
During an awards speech at the 23rd Annual Surrey RCMP awards, he called criticisms unfair, and reaffirmed RCMP officers’ ability to fight crime, saying they’ve been doing it for decades and will continue to do so.
“We can’t police a large city? We’ve been doing it since 1951. I would challenge any other large city in this country to police with the resources we do and do a better job,” said McDonald.

“I’m just saying, if you want more boots on the ground, give me more boots.”
McDonald didn’t specify who these critics were, but he openly suggested that government officials and others, who are probably being hyperbolic, should butt out and that their criticism isn’t valid.
“If I have to listen to one more ex-chief of police on life support or some fallen-from-grace former public official with an axe to grind or an uninformed academic call into question the integrity and professionalism and dedication of the men and women of the Surrey RCMP, I am going to snap,” said McDonald, who received great applause for his indignation.

“I’m just saying that some of these people have been put out to pasture for a reason, so let’s not forget it.”

Various people of note, specifically, former West Vancouver police chief and solicitor general Kash Heed and Ex-Mountie Chris Backus, have suggested the RCMP are unable to satisfy their duties and that some RCMP may switch the new Surrey Police Force if given the opportunity.
Clearly McDonald thinks that’s all nonsense and that the RCMP are doing the best possible job they can given the circumstances.

The Party released the document with only 10 days to go until the election and was comprised primarily of various policy plans Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer had promised throughout his campaign.
Rather than promising additional spending, services, and subsidies, the Conservative Party budget promises cut after cut after cut in a bid to return to a balanced budget over the course of 5 years, with the hope being a net surplus by the 2024-25.
The biggest tax cut will be the Universal Tax Cut, which will “reduce the tax rate on income under $47,630 from 15 per cent to 13.75 per cent,” in a bid to address the concerns of lower-income people and families. According to CTV News, this would cost approximately $548 million in 2020-21, and would likely grow in price as the Conservatives plan on progressively lowering the tax burden.
The next big cut on taxes would be removing GST from home energy bills, which would save each household roughly $100 dollars after being implemented.
Another cut to expenses comes in the form of a repeal to the Carbon Tax. According to the document, “For Canadians, if Justin Trudeau is given four more years, the price of gas will increase by 31.1 cents per litre and natural gas will increase by $469 per year.” This increase would be due to the emissions targets set by the Trudeau government, which would need progressive increases to the price of gas to incentivize alternative means of energy production.
However, to promote environmentally friendly alternatives, the Conservative have proposed creating a Green Home Renovation Tax Credit. This would be “To encourage Canadians to lower emissions from their homes, we will introduce a two-year, 20 per cent refundable tax credit to help cover the cost of green home renovations between $1,000 and $20,000,” the Conservative Party explains
“This would apply to things like solar panels, insulation, or energy efficient windows and doors that improve your home’s energy efficiency,” they write. “These green home improvements will save you money in the long term by lowering your monthly energy bill. These renovations also have the potential to increase the value of your home. This two-year tax credit will be available in the 2020 and 2021 calendar years.”
Another item on the list of addressing environmental concerns will be promoting public transit use by introducing a Green Public Transit Tax Credit, which the Conservatives believe would save a family reliant on services such as the TTC in Toronto up to $1,000 per year.
The Conservatives have also chosen to slash the taxing of maternity and parental benefits by “remov[ing] federal income tax from EI maternity and EI parental benefits by providing a tax credit for any income earned under these two programs.” They added that the savings from the tax credit will be paid up front so that new parents have access to the funds immediately.
They have also pledged to support adoptive parents.
All these tax cuts and credits will, of course, put a major strain on the government’s overall budget and is expected to save Canadians an estimated $69 billion over the next five years. To balance this cost, the Party says they will implement numerous cuts to various social service programs, as well as making major cuts to foreign spending, including a $1.5 billion cut to foreign aid in the first year. It will also run a $23 billion deficit in the first year if elected, easing into a surplus over a five-year period as infrastructure investments begin paying off.
This plan was heavily criticized by Liberal Party Leader Justin Trudeau.
“The Conservatives are proposing $53 billion worth of cuts. Deeper cuts than even Doug Ford is putting forward,” Trudeau said. “That’s why they waited until Friday night, of a long weekend, at the end of the election, before sharing with Canadians their plan to cut services.”
When asked about the cuts to various services, Scheer, again, promised that his Party will not slash any of the core services which people rely on.
“We are committed to increasing the transfer payments for health, education and social programs. That is a guaranteed,” Scheer said. “We’ve said where we’re going to get the money from. We’re going to get it from corporate welfare; we’re going to get it from foreign aid.
“We’re going to make sure that government real estate is allocated responsibly, so the government is wasting money with empty office space all over the country.”"

This fear has gone so far as to convince Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau to fly down to Singh’s own riding, Burnaby South, to try to take back voters from the opposition.
Liberals have increasingly fallen out of favour in B.C. over the course of Trudeau’s leadership.
Many have expressed outright anger over Trudeau’s decision to purchase the Trans Mountain Pipeline, despite his initial promises not to do so and B.C. citizens’ concerns about how it may negatively impact their lives.
According to Global News, Liberal insiders have “acknowledged that voter intentions are volatile in the province,” with the province being led by a New Democrat-Green partnership for more than two years, rather than the previous Liberal leadership.
Regarding pipelines, he came under heavy criticism over his decision to move forward with an Alberta-B.C. pipeline, but not one which would incorporate Quebec. Trudeau cited “zero social acceptability” in Quebec for his reason to not immediately begin building a pipeline into Quebec.
Furthermore, the obvious powerplay of coming to Singh’s home riding was not lost on the audience — this is the second visit Trudeau has personally made during the campaign. “When asked what message he was trying to send to Singh and the NDP with the visit, Trudeau instead warned about the billions in dollars the Conservatives have said they would cut in federal spending to fulfill their campaign promises and balance the budget in the next five years,” reports Global News."

Of course, It wasn’t always this way. I still remember the Trudeau government when they were first elected.
In those early moments, as the 2015 election results poured in, Conservatives screamed in anger, but ultimately a significant portion of the Canadian population breathed a sigh of relief, in hopes that the Liberal government would keep their many wondrous promises.
There would be a reasonable deficit to balance social services, it would be the last election under first past the post, journalists would be respected, there would be fewer scandals, and Canada would once again be popular on the world stage.
Those promises were, to the dismay of many, all broken.
Deficits ballooned year after year while expensive pipelines were bought and even more poorly thought out and expensive investment projects such as superclusters provided minimal benefits.
The promise to change electoral reform was dropped the moment the Liberals found out they would not be allowed to put forward a system to would largely lockout every other party.
Journalists received a bailout so toxic that it threatened their own credibility by accepting it, while those who refused and shared an ideology different from the government were in many cases banned from Liberal events.
The Trudeau government appointed Leaders’ Debate Commission even attempted to ban those same journalists from the only two debates in the country to feature all leadership candidates. Thanks to a court order, they failed.
Of course, it does not end with the rampant list of policy failures, there is also the seemingly endless list of reputation ruining scandals that are sure to make even a younger and perhaps more hopeful Justin Trudeau blush in self-embarrassment
""It’s hard not to feel disappointed in your government when every day there is a new scandal.""— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) October 17, 2013
Since 2015, Trudeau has decimated Canada’s foreign standing in no less than three instances.
The Prime Minister first embarrassed Canada with his controversial trip to India which included an invitation for a B.C. man convicted of attempted murder.
The Liberals then broke ethics laws three times in a row.
First Finance Minister Bill Morneau was forced to pay a fine for failing to report that he and his wife owned a French villa through a private company.
Then Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion ruled that Dominic LeBlanc violated conflict rules by awarding a lucrative fishing contract to a company set to be run by one of his wife’s first cousins.
Lastly, but most importantly, Dion found that the Trudeau government had clearly and repeatedly pressed the former Attorney General Jody Wilson Raybould to improperly intervene in a prosecution.
“The prime minister, directly and through his senior officials, used various means to exert influence over Ms. Wilson?Raybould,” said Dion.
“The authority of the prime minister and his office was used to circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the director of public prosecutions as well as the authority of Ms. Wilson?Raybould as the Crown’s chief law officer.”
The leader of our national government was trying, as the report stated, to “circumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions.”
Simplified, Dion found that the Prime Minister wanted to interfere in Canada’s legal system, potentially changing how a Liberal connected firm would ultimately be prosecuted.
The release of Dion’s report pushed five former attorney generals to write a letter demanding the RCMP investigate the claims.
Even the former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant, a Liberal who leads the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, stated in a column published by Brian Lilley for the Toronto Sun, that police officers “had laid obstruction of justice charges on a lot of ordinary Canadians, with a lot less evidence than this.”
While Dion’s findings were damning, Ottawa has blocked a full investigation by refusing to lift cabinet confidentiality. This has not just limited the Ethics Commissioner but also the RCMP who have been unable to interview multiple members of the PMO.
The RCMP have suspended their “inquiry” for the period of the election campaign, as is the norm for political investigations, but that does open a whole other can of worms once the election is over.
While the RCMP wait, the Trudeau government was thrown into perhaps their stupidest and most hypocritical scandal to date. The Prime Minister’s three-decade-long hobby of blackface.
For those catching up, during the early days of the 2019 campaign cycle, it became clear Canada’s virtue signaller in chief, had actually worn blackface on at least three instances, including when he was a 29-year-old teacher at one of the nation’s most prestigious private schools.
With the RCMP swimming around the Liberals, only abated by the election period, the stakes have become too serious and it seems the party’s response has been to delve deep into doublespeak and conspiracies in an effort to maintain the support of their base.
For example in response to Trudeau’s blackface fiasco, the Prime Minister himself attempted to push the blame off himself, and onto the Canadian public.
“I think there are a lot of Canadians through the past days who are reflecting on and learning more about the racist history of blackface. And that is something that certainly is something that we are all talking about and I am certainly reflecting on deeply” Trudeau said, as if Canadians had any of the blame to share for a 29-year-old man choosing to paint his face jet black in an effort to look like Alladin.
Of course, this was just the beginning.
The Prime Minister had the gall to tell two children of colour that “blackface is not something you should do,” when, once again, it was the Prime Minister who had performed the action.
But what could we expect from Trudeau, when his own MP’s have attempted to argue that putting on blackface made Trudeau more lovable? One MP has since apologized but, like the other candidates with a past filled with racism, homophobia, or bigotry, the Liberals won’t be dropping them either.
I mean how do you drop anyone from your party, when the leader has single-handedly lowered the bar? Well, you really can’t. Instead, you can attempt to push attention elsewhere, even if it means using fake news and conspiracy theories.
In the last week alone, the Liberal party alongside high-level campaign staff have used fake news and conspiracy theories at least twice in an effort to delegitimize either their political opposition or to silence journalists.
For example, the former Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Gerald Butts spread false information attempting to further tie the Conservative Party of Canada with the “Canadian alt-right”, by insinuating that Rebel Media was the host of the Conservative Party’s website.

The problem with the message? We have never taken money from the groups listed, especially the CPC.
Taking money from groups such as political parties and not declaring it would be illegal.
TPM has never made a declaration because we have never taken any campaign money.
The Liberals know this and certainly had the means to verify it, yet they decided to publish a defamatory piece of content regardless.
It seems that in a bid to survive the public scrutiny the party now faces, the Liberals made the pivot to publicizing fake news.
As a journalist, I can’t help but take a moment to point out that the people knee-deep in fake news and misinformation are also the same people who want to set up the toxic media bailout, and regulate the content you consume. I’d say that’s a whole new level of hypocrisy and self-inflicted wounds, but with 10 days left in this election, if there’s anything the Trudeau government has plenty of, it’s just that.
From the countless scandals and broken laws, to the growing moments of doublespeak and outright conspiracy theory peddling, I’d like to welcome Canadians to the Liberal party of 2019."

They have announced that they are filing a court application on behalf of the Alberta March for Life (AMLA) and its vice-chair, Jerry Pasternak, “against the City of Edmonton for its decision to cancel a scheduled lighting of the 60,000 LED-lit High Level Bridge in colours chosen by AMLA.”
First, some background on the lighting-up history of the High Level Bridge and the reasoning behind this application.
Edmonton conceived its “Light the Bridge” program with the objective of  helping to “recognize major events and cultural celebrations.” Its stated aim is “to reflect the diversity of people who call Edmonton home and our connection to the global community.” The bridge has been lit, in a variety of colours, for such causes/events as Melanoma Awareness, Disability Employment Awareness Month, Rosh Hashana, the Edmonton Oilers Home Opener and Wrongful Conviction Day.
The stated criteria include: events of national or international significance; local events that positively impact community spirit; national or international issues that build community “such as Treaty 6 Recognition Day or End Bullying Pink Shirt Day or World Cancer Day.” The city “reserves the right to deny requests that do not merit public support or are mainly personal, private, political, polarizing or commercial in nature.” (emphasis mine)
This is the second time Edmonton has cancelled a pro-life group’s scheduled bridge-lighting on the grounds that it was “polarizing,” as per its criteria caveats. In May 2017 AMLA received permission to celebrate a March for Life via the bridge, lit up in pink and blue, but was cancelled. The JCCF observes that the city does not offer any precise definition of what “polarizing” means, and furthermore:
“The City of Edmonton is home to a diverse population with a wide variety of views, values and beliefs including, unsurprisingly, persons who express pro-life views. As a government that is constitutionally obligated to be neutral regarding the expression of its citizens, it is not the proper role of the city to elevate and promote the favoured ideological causes of some citizens to the exclusion of the lawful views of others,” stated Justice Centre staff lawyer James Kitchen in a JCCF press release.
In the lawsuit, the JCCF will argue that Edmonton is offering state property to the public to utilize for expression, and can therefore only limit expression in a justified manner. Obviously hate speech, or overt racism or obscenity would run counter to the values and purposes underlying freedom of speech. But, they argue, expression of a pro-life opinion is none of these things, nor can it be considered any more “political” or “polarizing” than other causes for which the bridge has been lit.
According to the JCCF, the arbitrary decision is procedurally deficient in that neither notice of cancellation nor opportunity to respond was provided. The lawsuit requests that the City only light the bridge “without political or ideological favouritism” or in “neutral colours” (perhaps blue and gold, the province’s colours), as well as a declaration that the cancellation was unjust.
Edmonton naturally set out with the best of intentions in planning the Lights program. However, when they wrote the words “personal, private, political, polarizing,” did their committee members actually have a discussion about what the words meant, or wonder if their own assumptions about “political” and “polarizing” were the gold standard of settled opinion? Did they ask themselves whether polarizing meant the same thing as, say, “opposition” of opinion?
Perhaps they had in mind anything that might give offence to certain groups. One might easily deduce this since in our current era pro-life groups are often held up to ridicule and contempt without consequence, because pro-abortion is treated by most politicians and virtually all members of our cultural elite as the default opinion of all civilized and enlightened people.
And yet the offence is purely ideological. Those who do believe in the sanctity of human life from conception are not promoting violence, or actively preventing anyone from having an abortion. They seek to persuade fellow citizens to their belief, but the freedom to attempt to persuade others is the basis of democracy. The judgment that it is “polarizing” has not come down from some objective, disinterested court. It is a subjective judgment that has come down from activists and ideologues whose opinions our progressive elites defer to. How is it the city’s business to privilege one ideology over another?
One could argue that the city has grounds for rejecting the light display because of its “community-building” criterion. It is true that any and all pro-life displays cause social tension. But one could say the same for Pride, which in recent years has become extremely politicized, and which contains indecent presentation and performance that offend many people, especially parents of young children. But since LGBT feelings are routinely privileged in our institutions of education and governance over the feelings of those who find elements of the Pride brand off-putting, the city apparently does not find Pride polarizing at all, only “community-building.”
Likewise, the bridge is open to a request for the Walk a Mile in Her Shoes movement, which raises consciousness for violence against women, an important cause to be sure. But would it be open to, say, Male Victims of Intimate Partner Violence Awareness Week? The statistics on male victimhood within relationships are (I know, hard to believe, but true) almost equal to female victimhood, but I am guessing that any attempt to use the Bridge to raise awareness of that fact would be considered “polarizing.”
It may be that pro-life displays are not community-building, but that is not their fault. Pro-lifers are always willing to engage in civil dialogue with pro-abortionists, and civil engagement is the most fundamental community-building exercise (remember Norman Rockwell’s famous painting?). But those who consider pro-abortion the only admissible position in public life do not usually willingly engage with pro-lifers. Yet in the present cultural climate, their intransigence, their insistence that there can be only one correct opinion on this subject is not considered polarizing, while the opinion that the subject should be up for debate is considered polarizing, a faulty and undemocratic assumption that the City of Edmonton has demonstrated in their cancellation.
If the city cannot exercise ideological neutrality in its assignment of the Lights, then it should get out of the ideas and “rights” business altogether. Governments, after all, have no obligation to promote “causes” at all. Edmonton could reserve the Lights for a narrow swath of indisputably community-building communication, such as support for the city’s sports teams, physical-disease awareness weeks/months, national holidays and other apple-pie messaging.
But if they wish to go beyond those parameters and offer a podium for philosophical positions or ideals, then they have an obligation to treat groups that dissent from popular opinions with the same respect and rights to that tax-funded space as those with popular opinions."
0,2019-10-11T09:38:10.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/new-national-womens-initiative-aims-to-tackle-big-issue-topics,New national women’s initiative aims to tackle big issue topics,"Canada: Powered by Women, a new national initiative designed to bring women together physically and virtually through social media to have political discussions about big issues, was started over the summer by a group of women from Calgary. They are not a women’s group per se, in that they are not interested in women-only issues. Instead, they see themselves as a women’s group that is defending the best interests of all Canadians. The group is based in Calgary, and has its roots in the energy sector. But the group, which is registered with Elections Canada as third-party advertisers, prides itself on creating a space that is open to perspectives from all regions and sectors.
The group was spurred into action by a late August Angus Reid survey which showed that more than half of uncommitted voters (58 percent) at that time were women under 35. This prompted the group to hire Leger Research to take a closer look at this and they found that:
Women were less likely to feel informed about political issues.
They were less likely to raise political issues for discussion in social settings.
They were less likely to feel their views were represented in the media.
They were less likely to feel their votes made a difference.
According to that same Leger survey, 57% percent of Canadian women believe that there are too many competing messages to know what to believe.
This shouldn’t surprise Canadians. A recent Digital Democracy Research Project called Media, Knowledge and Misinformation released in August 2019 by the Public Policy Forum found that the problem with Canadian media was that “survey respondents who read or watched more traditional news media were less likely to express uncertainty about policy questions than those with low consumption, but more likely to give an incorrect response.” In other words, our mainstream media is giving its readers and viewers inaccurate information and a false sense of confidence about that inaccurate information.
In the same Leger survey, only 20% of Canadian women felt that the average citizen’s voice is reflected in the media. This finding, I think, denotes at least the perception (if not the fact) that the journalist and pundit class have not been doing a good job of understanding what issues are important to the majority of Canadians. This is supported by the same DDP report which ranks the concerns of the Canadian public versus what candidates and journalists assume Canadians’ biggest concerns to be.
As illustrated by figures 5 and 6, most Canadians are most concerned with the environment, healthcare, the economy, and taxes, in that order. Yet, the top issues for journalists were ethics, the environment, and foreign affairs.
Another interesting finding from the Leger survey is that 61 percent of Canadian women say that the media only shows the most extreme political views.
What I found particularly encouraging about Canada: Empowered by Women when I stopped by the breakfast discussion recently held in Saint Leonard was their focus on a holistic approach to these discussions. Instead of treating each topic, for example environment, climate change, taxes, health care, or the economy, as if it existed in a vacuum, and as if choosing to focus on one meant giving up another, the group took a more practical approach, understanding that a decision about any number of these topics inevitably affects the others.
In an attempt to inform, connect, and mobilize Canadian women voters, and create spaces where big issue topics can be discussed, a “Question of the Day” relating to politics is shared on the group’s blog, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter platforms. There, women can join in on the discussion.
For those interested in checking out the initiative, there is an upcoming breakfast in Toronto on the 17th. And the next virtual event will be on the 16th at 7 pm EST, which will involve 50+ students via Zoom from Halifax, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver/Victoria which will be broadcast via Facebook live."

Singh’s tremendous recovery from the bottom of the barrel at 22% approval, to taking the lead, happened over a month’s time, with another spike from 33% to 49% shortly after his stellar leaders debate performance.
The current ranking stands at:
Jagmeet Singh (NDP) – 49%
Elizabeth May (Green) – 42%
Justin Trudeau (Liberal) – 31%
Andrew Scheer (CPC) – 27%
When taking into account job disapproval, Trudeau leads the metric in first place with 54% of Canadians disapproving of the current prime minister. Trudeau is followed by Andrew Scheer (53%), then Elizabeth May (24%), and finally Jagmeet Singh (22%) who has the lowest disapproval rate.
However, 23% of Canadians think that Justin Trudeau would make the best prime minister, while only 20% think the same of Scheer. On that metric, Singh, who is at 15% has surpassed Elizabeth May who is at 7%."

“I can’t divulge those costs,” said Bullfrog Power spokesperson Greg Dyrgas. “I asked them if the Liberals wanted me to but they said refer any questions to them.”
But The Post Millennial was able to learn a few things.
For starters, buying offsets for a jet plane is not cheap, about $220 for each hour Trudeau’s 737-200 series cargo plane is in the air, and slightly less per-hour for his primary plane, a somewhat more fuel efficient 737-800.
And secondly, offsets the Liberals purchased will go toward a landfill project near Windsor Ontario that captures methane – whose heat-trapping power in the atmosphere is 30 times that of CO2 –  in order to flare it.

Follow Trudeau’s cargo plane on Twitter: @TrudeauPlaneB
“At an uncapped landfill, that methane is just venting all the time and it’s a lot more powerful than CO2,” Drygas explained. “In this case, it goes into the pipes and goes to a centralized point where it is flared. So you get about 95 percent reduction in the amount of CO2 equivalents and that’s where you generate the offset.”
The Essex County landfill is currently the only domestic project that Bullfrog sells carbon offsets for, and Drygas said there are three international projects but did not provide details about those.
According to Drygas, single passenger offsets cost between $40 and $50 for a roundtrip flight between Vancouver and Halifax, regardless of the type of plane, or in the case of the Liberal Party, a bulk purchase of $24/ton of CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption.
“Essential inputs to the formula are kilometres, leading to the amount of jet fuel and the algorithm will use some sort of average jet. It wouldn’t necessarily go down to a Boeing versus Airbus etcetera,” Drygas said.
“So it basically comes down to how far you’re flying and there’s a fair amount of fuel that is used in taxiing and takeoff and that leads to the fuel number, multiplied by the amount of CO2 per litre of jet fuel.”
A litre of gasoline produces around 2.3kg of CO2, diesel is about 2.6kg and jet fuel is somewhere in between, said Drygas; “closer to diesel”.
Based on this information and plane specifications, if the 737-200 were carrying its standard 119 passenger load, based on $50/passenger individual offsets, aggregate costs for the coast-to-coast roundtrip would be $5950 and $8100 for the 737-800 which can carry a full load of 162 passengers.
If it is rated by fuel consumption, as Drygas noted was the Liberals preference, to cover the same round trip for the 737-200 (cargo plane) would ring in at $3100.44 and $2543.52 for the newer, more fuel-efficient 737-800 that Trudeau travels in.
Now keep in mind these calculations are for just one, Vancouver-Halifax roundtrip flight on either plane, employing passenger and fuel consumption metrics and on top of charter costs. According to Paramount Business Jets, renting a 737-800 jet will run you about $21,250/hour.
“The ideal is use less energy to begin with…that’s what we’ll always tell customers,” said Drygas. “Really the offsets are for energy there is no green alternative for today. And that’s why flights are the most common use for offsets.”
The Toronto Sun reported last week the Liberal campaign’s cargo plane is “considered one of the least efficient and worst polluting airliners in current service.”
It raises questions why the Liberal party, which claims humanity is facing an existential crisis due to climate change, needs a second plane and carbon offsets, not actual reductions to the atmosphere, is adequate.
Asked about the relationship between Gerald Butts – Trudeau’s campaign manager and former top aide – and Bullfrog co-founder Tom Heintzman, Drygas dismissed the photo of the pair circulating on social media as proof Heintzman was “getting a kickback”.
“That’s from the (2012) World Wildlife Fund CN Tower stair climb – I think everyone who climbed the tower that day has a picture with Gerald Butts,” he said.
“So if somebody’s saying, ‘Tom’s getting kickbacks because the Liberals are buying carbon offsets,’ well Tom hasn’t had a financial interest in more than six years in the company, so he wouldn’t benefit in any way from what is by the way, a very, very small purchase in the context of our business.”
While Heintzman isn’t getting a kickback, taxpayers ultimately take on Trudeau’s dual jet plane usage and the carbon offsets he purchased to the tune of up to 75 percent worth of tax credits all political donations receive."

As part of this pledge, Indigenous nations will be given $1 billion in loan guarantees to help kickstart Indigenous involvement in crucial resource projects. Over the next four years, the Alberta Indigenous Opportunities Corporation (IOC) hopes to play a vital role in carrying out that for the province.
The IOC will not explicitly provide capital for start-ups projects but will instead focus on providing the technical and financial expertise needed to start a business and access any existing grants.
The IOC, said Premier Jason Kenney, will allow Indigenous people to “get in the game and benefit from the resources that lie under the lands that were first inhabited by their ancestors.”
Alberta’s Indigenous community deserves a government that will help create opportunities, generate prosperity, and renew the entrepreneurial spirit for many struggling to make ends meet.
The IOC was one of Premier Kenney’s campaign promises made leading up to his election victory over Rachel Notley and the NDP this past spring.
After forming government with a landslide majority, Premier Kenney met with First Nations leaders and received “an overwhelming consensus in favour of economic opportunities, also entailing responsible resource development.”
This past summer, Indigenous Relations Minister Rick Wilson met with more than 150 key stakeholders to discuss the benefits of a renewed partnership under the IOC.
In a statement, Minister Wilson said, “This new Crown corporation is a bold and innovative way of building relationships with Indigenous communities to get natural resource projects moving forward and get Alberta’s economy back to work. The returns on these investments can help fund the community programs and services the Indigenous communities want.”
Echoing his comments, Premier Kenney explained, “We want to empower Indigenous communities so they can lift their people out of poverty and become full partners in prosperity. An Alberta that remains strong and free is one where all can take full advantage of its abundance of natural resources that have enriched this province for decades.”
Indigenous leaders weigh in
Herb Lehr
Herb Lehr, the president of the Metis Settlements General Council, was also on board with the new initiative saying, “The Métis people of Alberta have long been involved in the resources sector, and are pleased to see this type of proactive work from the province.”
Calvin Helin, the president of Eagle Spirit Energy Holding Ltd and long-time advocate for Indigenous involvement in the resource sector, stated, “It is no secret that there is immense interest from the First Nations of this country to own big resource sector projects. This initiative will go a long way to accomplish that.”
Calvin Helin
While many leaders were on board with the change, including Stephen Buffalo, the president and CEO of the Indian Resource Council, some, like Treaty 8 Grand Chief Arthur Noskey, are skeptical.
While Noskey has yet to comment on anything specifically, he has expressed his concerns with the UCP before their election earlier this year.
Arthur Noskey is taking a step back approach to the IOC agreement, and this is not the first time Noskey has been skeptical of the Kenney government in the past."

The road separates the U.S. from Quebec and is a hot spot of illegal entry into Canada, with prospective migrants simply crossing the border and immediately claiming asylum, leading to a process that can sometimes take years to resolve.
“For Canadians to have faith in the immigration system, the rules have to be followed and the laws have to be enforced. As prime minister, that’s exactly what I will do,” Scheer said.
According to CBC, “Between January and August this year, RCMP intercepted 10,343 people entering the country from the U.S. outside legal border points, the vast majority of them at Roxham Road. That’s down from 14,125 in the same period in 2018.”
A major talking point was the prospective correcting of the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) with the U.S., which allows migrants to claim in Canada, despite having crossed through the U.S. first.
“We want to make sure that when people come into Canada, we are putting the safety and security of Canadians first. That is paramount,” Scheer continued.
He also clarified that while he wants to tackle immigration from unofficial crossing points, he would like to promote legal economic immigration into Canada.
To facilitate these changes and protections, Scheer promised to hire “250 new Canada Border Services Agency officers, more Immigration and Refugee Board judges to “hotspots” to expedite claims, and closely monitor criminal groups that pose a threat to Canada, including MS-13 gang members,” reports CBC."

However, two issues that were not discussed at any length was military spending, and support for Veterans.
That is appalling.
There appears to have been one mention of Veterans that lasted about 5 seconds, and there was zero discussion of Canada’s nearly non-existent armed forces.
And considering how the world is becoming more and more dangerous, and how our nation is being left at the mercy of foreign countries, it represents a failure of Canada’s entire political class.
The most basic function of government is to protect the nation it governs, and that means having a military that is capable of deterring potential aggression and encroachment on our territory.
Some might say, “what aggression,” and “what encroachment,” but they would be ignoring the fact that countries like China and Russia are increasingly active in the arctic, and that Canada’s arctic claims are seen as a joke because we have no ability to enforce them.
Combine that with the fact that cyberwarfare, the militarization of space, the rise of advanced drones, and hypersonic missiles give a clear edge to technologically advanced nations (like Canada if we actually used that advantage) and the potential for both tremendous vulnerability and tremendous security exists.
But none of that was discussed at the debate.
Imagine a destabilized and chaotic world that quickly descends into violence…
Wouldn’t you want Canada to have – at the very least – a strong air force and effective hypersonic weapons to deter anyone with potentially hostile intent?
Wouldn’t it be better to at least start to build up our strength now, rather than get caught off guard when it’s nearly too late?
Consider the fact that people in the early 1910s and 1930s couldn’t have predicted the horrific violence and carnage that awaited the world, and you can see that simply hoping for the best is a fool’s errand.
Canada’s military spending is stunningly low, and that means the cost of strengthening our armed forces – particularly if we focus on the air force and hypersonic missiles would actually be quite low as well.
When you consider that Canada ran deficits of about $60 billion at the height of the global recession, and we are running endless deficits of $20 billion even without a recession, it’s clear that the doubling of our military budget (from $20 billion to $40 billion) is eminently feasible.
Additionally, such a surge in military investment would be a massive driver of innovation, create a massive amount of jobs, and boost our domestic economy, lessening our reliance on exports.
Yet, none of that will happen until we start demanding that our leaders take the defence of our nation seriously, and stop sleepwalking towards potential disaster.
Even more appalling than the failure to discuss military spending is the absence of discussion of the struggles facing our veterans.
Our veterans put everything on the line for us, yet have been repeatedly abandoned by the federal government, both Liberals and Conservatives alike. And who can forget Justin Trudeau’s infamous “asking for more than we’re able to give right now,” comment to veterans, even as he kept massively increasing spending everywhere else?
That should have been brought up, and all party leaders should have been forced to make strong and ironclad commitments to Canada’s veterans.
By excluding discussion of veterans and military spending, the political class has once again shown a lack of understanding of their responsibility to the Canadian People."

The debate was held inside the Museum of Canadian History’s Grand Hall – if you haven’t been, highly recommended just for the totem poles – but accredited media were herded into a separate research building to view the live action via closed-circuit tv.
And so my foray into “live-tweeting” began, by watching the event on television like everyone else in the country.
As mediocre a platform for soundbites as it was, the debate remained the only opportunity for Canadian voters to witness all federal party leaders discuss the issues and defend their policies in English, before the general election on October 21.
If you haven’t already heard what happened in the debate, my Twitter thread via @TPostMillennial is a good entree.
Live tweet: You can follow the thread from the beginning by clicking here.
Now Trudeau and Scheer are in the weeds over 2005 comments made about same-sex marriage, abortion issue.

Singh jumps in and says only women should have a say on abortion.

After all the men finish screaming, @ElizabethMay is finally allowed to speak.

Yup. #cdnpoli #Elexn43— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) October 8, 2019
Back in Montreal, The Post Millennial team sorted clips, quote checked and then turned in some great coverage too, including this writeup on the bald-faced lie Justin Trudeau told about SNC-Lavalin, again.
But at the same time, I urge readers to check out other media coverage too.
That is the point of a vibrant and free press. More perspectives, not fewer is the only way to bolster our free market of ideas.
The other part of the equation is free choice; consumers should decide which information is of use to them, not faceless bureaucrats. Beyond policing criminal speech as defined in Canada’s Criminal Code, the government really has no business impeding expression it doesn’t like.
Which brings us to the story of the night.
The Leaders’ Debates Commission, who concocted the consortium that produced this turgid affair, had been dragged through federal court just hours earlier, for denying media accreditation to a pair of Rebel Media reporters, as well as True North’s Andrew Lawton.
As a backdrop to the Federal Court case, Lawton had been prevented from attending several Liberal Party events as a reporter and even escorted out of a Trudeau campaign rally in Thunder Bay, where he pre-registered as a guest.
Even when Lawton pressed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the post-debate scrum, on his exclusion from covering the Liberal campaign, Trudeau was non-committal.
According to True North founder Candice Malcolm, Lawton was refused entry to a Liberal campaign event in Markham Ontario, Wednesday morning.
Trudeau smugly refuses to commit to letting True North join the Liberal media bus, despite a judge ordering so today. @AndrewLawton pic.twitter.com/u8n4rMWjzc— Candice Malcolm (@CandiceMalcolm) October 8, 2019
And so this tenuous status quo among establishment media and politicos pretending they be the gatekeepers for who is worthy of accreditation and who is not, continues.
Bernier probably described our country’s current free expression woes best when he chided Singh for being all in favour of “diversity”, except when it came to the diversity of opinion.
Rebel Media reporter David Menzies was also part of the trio of reporters the Federal Court ordered accredited for the Leaders’ Debates on Monday.
While accounts differ on why Menzies was physically ejected from a Conservative event last week, then arrested by Andrew Scheer’s RCMP detail (he was later released without charges), the fact remains Menzies was manhandled from the venue by another major party engaged this game of deciding who is a journalist and who isn’t.
So with all that strange and dangerous anti-free speech water under the bridge while mainstream media largely goes la-di-frickin-da, TPM was the only news organization apart from Canadian Press who even attended federal court Monday afternoon.
The verdict: the debates commission lost, and free speech won. Meanwhile, Canadian Press’s story – picked up by some MSM outlets – caged the contest as a loss for the gatekeepers trying to prevent “right-wing outlets” engaged “advocacy” from acting as journalists; a delusion in itself to believe that MSM’s varied tentacles have never, ever engaged in advocacy.
With their legal costs awarded and media accreditation ordered by the Federal Court of Canada, Lawton, as well as Keane Bexte and Menzies were issued press badges and allowed into the event.
Keep in mind, of the journalists already accredited some 90 were there on behalf of CBC/Radio-Canada, as well as reporters for state-funded Al-Jazeera based in Qatar and some Vietnamese state mouthpiece.
Inside the media holding tank before the debate began, Menzies interviewed Lawton, Bexte sat quietly at a table working and two very important things did not happen.
First, and perhaps most troubling: MSM did not give the slightest care.
They don’t like the cut of Rebel’s or True North’s jib, mostly because these outlets represent serious competition and delve into matters MSM is either too ginned up on PC KoolAid to notice, or too timid to dare.
And number two; MSM bore witness that the fabric of the universe did not come undone as some of Rebel’s and Lawton’s shrillest detractors in MSM and politics would have had everyone believe, were they accredited.
A day later, that universal fabric may have come slightly unhinged for Gerald Butts, who spent much of Tuesday maligning anyone on Twitter who reposted Keane Bexte’s post-debate scrum question about #TrudeauBlackface on the world stage and whether the PM apologized to African and Middle Eastern leaders.
PM @JustinTrudeau: Embarrassment. https://t.co/PQsQ7FSge6— Sebastian Gorka DrG (@SebGorka) October 8, 2019
Based on Butts’ previous digital gibberish, it’s difficult to know if he understands the associated irony of his social media fit  – retweeting anyone who posted the segment and calling them names – only further proliferated the offending clip.
Canadian far-right orgs like Rebel are appendages of the global alt-right anatomy. Never doubt where the heart is.

Watch who traffics their question from last night today. #elxn43 https://t.co/tIYYVPyIFQ— Gerald Butts ?? (@gmbutts) October 8, 2019
And while some reporters are between horrified and annoyed that guys like Menzies, Bexte and Lawton are even allowed in the same press confines, they’d do well to remember that journalism is not this vaunted profession many like to pretend it is.
No special training is required to produce journalism.
It is a job that involves asking people questions and writing down the answers, observing your surroundings and adding particular context where required.
Reporters are observers and communicators of events and ideas. Nothing more. Nothing less.
Inside the marketplace of ideas, some may appreciate the questions, answers and particular subjects and story-telling technique a journalist employs, others might not.
The beauty of freedom of choice and freedom of the press is the ability for the consumer to decide which reporting is relevant, not a bureaucrat or another cadre of other journalists, which is the ditch Canada is stuck in at the moment.
Any arbitrary measures to exclude people who present as journalists, have a body of work and earn a living from it is the very last thing that will help any of us who practice journalism, or the vibrancy of our free press and our democracy."

Overall, the Tories gained four points while the Liberals lost a staggering six. Both the NDP and the BQ gained one point too, while the PPC lost one.
If the new polling results were translated into seats, we would see a Conservative minority government.
The Conservatives would hold 152 seats, the Liberals 117, while the NDP would rise to 29, and the Greens 4. The Bloc would go from roughly 10 seats to 36 seats in Quebec.
Meanwhile, the poll for who would make the best Prime Minister for Canada saw a similar trend for the Liberals.

While Scheer’s rating did not change, the drop in Trudeau’s rating was enough to give him the top spot.
While gains in the polls were more spread out, all of Trudeau’s losses here appear to have gone towards Jagmeet Singh. Singh is now just six percentage points behind Trudeau, who is second.
The last two polls appear to coincide with other data on who respondents believe won the debate.
Scheer (23 percent) and Singh (21 percent) are virtually tied for the top spot, followed by Trudeau (15 percent), Blanchet (7 percent) and May (5 percent)."

A clip from the show that surfaced on Twitter last night shows a very strange interaction between two young girls and Trudeau. One young girl asks Trudeau a question that many Canadians have been wondering: “Why did you paint your face brown?”
Trudeau responds: “Ooh. Um, it was something I shouldn’t have done because it hurt people. It’s not something that you should do and that is something that I learned. I didn’t know it back then and I know it now, and I’m sorry that I hurt people.”
Another young girl had a follow-up question: “But did you paint your nose and your hands brown?”
“Mmmhmm. Yeah. And it was the wrong thing to do,” Trudeau responded.

Canada’s constitution requires the federal government to provide basic healthcare to members of the military, while the bills for advance care at civilian hospitals like surgeries is covered by the federal government.
When a member of the Canadian military undergoes such a procedure the army is expected to pay the hospital back for the services. However, recent substantial changes this spring has reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare for Canadians in uniform.
Under the new rules, the military will cover fewer fees meaning that hospitals will have to deal with the losses.
Several hospitals are expecting losses in the millions. For example, hospitals in Ontario could have to pay approximately $10 million without help from the federal government.
Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott raised concerns with federal Minister of Health Ginette Petitpas Taylor and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan about the new changes.
” I was surprised and extremely disappointed to learn that the federal  government, through the Canadian Armed Forces, is attempting to  unilaterally impose a new fee schedule for the delivery of health care  to serving members and veterans. These changes, which were communicated  without consultation, could result in either undue burden on hospitals  or, worse yet, military members and veterans being charged to access  health care services. Neither of these options are acceptable,” wrote Elliott in a letter obtained by Global News.
The changes do not only affect Ontario, but other provinces as well. Alberta is expected to lose $2 million in healthcare revenue.
Critics of the cuts are asking questions about whether the new funding changes will lead to members of the military being denied vital services by Canadian hospitals."

For those not from Quebec, Bill 21 bans all religious symbols such as a headscarf, kippa, or cross, regardless of size, and affects municipal service workers such as public transit drivers, doctors, dentists, and midwives in public institutions, subsidized daycares, and those working for school boards.
The bill is based on the Bouchard-Taylor report published in 2009 which looked at sensitive areas of integration, but both Taylor and Bouchard have declared their opposition to the bill, largely due to its targeting individuals not considered to be holding authority, such as teachers or daycare workers and its willingness to invoke the notwithstanding clause.
It is also worringly popular in Quebec with up to 70% of the population supporting the bill, according to some polls.
During the debate, Trudeau, who must sweep Quebec in order to win, got perhaps some of his strongest footings when challenging Mr. Singh for his unwillingness to oppose Bill 21.

While the Liberal party leader faced an assault on almost every front throughout the debate when it came to many progressive voters this moment mattered.
“It’s a question of yes, it’s awkward politically, because as Mr. Blanchet says it is very popular,” Trudeau states.
“But I am the only one on the stage who has said yes… a federal government might have to intervene on this.”
While Trudeau used the word “might,” it was more than Singh could muster, and as a result, he set the stage for 2019 quite clearly.
Vote Trudeau or receive someone who will provide even less.
With the election rapidly nearing its ends, and some Canadians fearful of a “Harper/Scheer” government, that may be a good enough deal.
While this moment truly stood out, it also highlights the state of Canadian politics in 2019.
For many Canadians, standing up for minority rights this election involves voting for an individual who has a three-decade-long blackface hobby."

To register, users will simply need to be over the age of 18, have a Saskatchewan health card and an SGI driver’s license or a piece of photo ID. The site offers a secure portal for a variety of health records and lab results.
Warren Kaeding, the Rural and Remote Health Minister released a statement saying that “This is a game-changer, giving patients the information they need to play an active role in their health care.” Adding that “Some provinces that offer similar programs have delays built in so that people have to wait to see their personal health information, and some provinces only provide limited lab results or require people to have a family physician in order to sign up.”
The website also has a suite of features to help users monitor their personal health. They can do this by adding personal health information to generate reports and can set up medication and appointment reminders all through the website. It also offers history of hospital and clinic visits to users. The site even offers users the ability to upload information from personal health devices such as the Fitbit line of devices.
The site claims to host a bevy of benefits for users
“Having quick and easy access to your personal health information may help you to be more:
Proactive in managing chronic conditions and your overall health
Informed to make better decisions about your health and care
Engaged with health care providers
Prepared when travelling”
President and CEO  Michael Green of Canada Health Infoway, a non-profit company that helped design the site had this to say to Global News: “Patients and the health system will see significant benefits from things like fewer unnecessary phone calls and less time taken off work for routine medical appointments. More importantly, greater access to information empowers patients to be more active participants in their care, and that can result in better health outcomes.”
The province ensures users that all information on the site will be secure through a secure login. Whether other provinces will follow suit in making health records more accessible is unknown."

Perhaps, I thought, it was fate that I happened to have just put on the kettle and logged on to YouTube as the livestream popped up in my recommended feed, the leaders only three minutes away from being brought out. Perhaps, I thought, it would save me from having to find something to watch with my evening snack.
What a horrible, horrible mistake.
Between the hollow talking points, incompetent moderation, uninteresting topics, and even more uninteresting individuals gracing the stage, I felt as though I had been plunged into a Dantean hellscape from which there was very little return. Sure, I could have closed YouTube. But I can’t turn off my country.
Andrew Scheer had somehow managed to wipe off the annoyingly perpetual smile sewn into the fabric of his chubby Saskatchewan cheeks long enough to attack Justin Trudeau within the first 20 seconds of his speaking time, to the complete neglect of the question he had been asked.
It was a move so cringe-inducingly amateur that I audibly moaned in a physical manifestation of psychological pain. It would be a foreshadowing of the remainder of Trudeau and Scheer’s interactions…
In a void, as though they were wounded lovers hurling poorly executed insults at each other in a hotel room. Even when interacting directly with a different leader, there would very rarely be a lost moment when the conversation would not be brought back around to the apple of their eye.
We’ve all heard of the Bechdel Test, in which representations of women in art are measured by whether the works feature two women talking about something other than a man. Surely there’s got to be a Canadian Debate Bechdel Test – are the Conservative and Liberal leaders talking about something other than the Liberal and Conservative leaders, respectively? Last night’s debate failed my imaginary test at least 90% of the time.
Not that the other 10% was any better, mind. I recall Trudeau whitesplaining racism to Jagmeet Singh as Singh seemed unable or unwilling to challenge Quebec’s secularism law. I am sure I was not the only person waiting in nail-biting anticipation for Trudeau to speak knowledge on his own lived experience as a man who also wears a turban, sometimes.
At one point, the reality of the two-party system became so obvious that it seemed like Elizabeth May and Jagmeet Singh – God rest their souls – were almost appealing to Trudeau and Scheer as undecided voters, and they certainly were being addressed as such.
Trudeau stared down his long, crooked nose at Elizabeth May, smug smile draped across his now-uncharacteristically pale face, as she actively told him he would win the election. In that moment, she was not the leader of a federal party, but rather a grandmother who had stumbled out of her duplex in her nightgown when she saw her MP doorknocking, hoping to  appeal to his good graces. I could almost hear her, shaky voice echoing off the suburban drive, “Change your policies, Sir. I’ll vote for you this time. But you get your act together, young man. No, I won’t take a lawn sign.”
Logging on to Twitter, a tweet from the Conservative Party ended up on my feed via a followed account. “Andrew Scheer WINS debate!” it read, citing no one, sourcing nothing. I have no doubt other parties were doing similar unreferenced victory laps about their leader’s debate performance. Farcical.
If you made it through with your will to live still intact then pat yourself on the back."

Off the bat, Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer got Trudeau with a remark about Trudeau’s infamous blackface incident.
“Justin Trudeau only pretends to stand up for Canada. He’s very good at pretending things. He can’t even remember how many times he put blackface on. Because the fact of the matter is, he’s always wearing a mask.”

Scheer’s comment alludes to the fact that, after the first photo had been released of Trudeau at an Arabian Nights themed party, he admitted to one other incident of wearing makeup, while singing Harry Belafonte’s Banana Boat Song. This fell apart when the next morning, a third incident appeared, again appearing in full black face.
Sparks flew shortly after when Green Party Leader Elizabeth May butted heads with People’s Party Leader Maxime Bernier, who lambasted May’s policies, comparing them to the failed socialist state of Venezuela.
“I appreciate you, but I don’t share your socialist policies. We won’t be able to create any wealth with your policies. You have the same sort of policies as socialist countries like Venezuela. You won’t create any wealth. You have to admit that.”

As the night went on, New Democrat Leader Jagmeet Singh again made his position clear regarding his thoughts on Maxime Bernier. Only two weeks ago, Singh publicly announced that he believed Bernier and his party had no place on the debate stage, stating that he should not be invited to the event.
Singh did not shy away from that motion tonight. Rather, he told Bernier directly, telling him that he “incites hatred,” that he does not deserve a platform, and that his ideas were harmful to Canada.

It was at this point that Bernier counter-punched at Singh, questioning his commitment to freedom of speech.
“You’re for diversity. But what about diversity of opinion?” asked Bernier. “I have the right to have another opinion about immigration, and I don’t know why—you’re a leader, yet you must try to have everybody on your side. But are you believing in free speech only when people are saying things that you want to hear?”

Near the end of the debate, Andrew Scheer went after Justin Trudeau for his constant attacks on Conservative Premiers including Doug Ford and Jason Kenney suggesting that he should consider running for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party instead of the prime minister’s job.
“There is a vacancy for the Ontario Liberal leadership, and if you’re so focused on provincial politics, go and run for the leadership of that party,” said Scheer to applause.

The Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery has rejected the applications of both Rebel News and True North News to attend and report on today’s political party leaders’ election debate.
Collin Lafrance, Chief of the Press Gallery Secretariat, has excluded both organizations because they are alleged to be “actively involved in advocacy.”
If Mr. Lafrance is correct in his assessment of True North and Rebel News, then these two media outlets would fit in well with many of the Press Gallery’s existing members, which advocate openly and actively for causes, perspectives and ideologies.
For example, the Xinhua (New China) News Agency is a member of the Canadian Press Gallery, despite being the official state-run press agency of the Chinese government. Xinhua’s president is a member of the Central  Committee of China’s Communist Party.
In one example of Xinhua’s “news” is this recent article which states: “Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech during Tuesday’s National Day celebrations was warmly embraced across the globe, with politicians and experts in different parts of the world expressing support for China’s social and economic development … China’s remarkable success in the past seven decades since the founding of the People’s Republic of China has come from its own way of governing — socialism with Chinese characteristics …”
That statement from Xinhua comes in the context of an increasingly violent and brutal crackdown of democratic protests in Hong Kong.
Do Mr. Lafrance and the Press Gallery think that Xinhua is not engaging in  “advocacy,” or is it that they are OK with this kind of advocacy?
Another Press Gallery member that is “actively involved in advocacy” is our taxpayer-funded CBC, which consistently promotes left-wing ideology in and through its coverage, and even more so by way of what the CBC  chooses not to cover.
As just one example, the CBC refused to provide any coverage of the July 4, 5 and 17, 2019 BC Human Rights Tribunal hearings of Jessica (Jonathan)  Yaniv’s complaints against female estheticians who had refused to provide a “Brazilian” bikini wax for Yaniv’s male genitalia.
It was not until Yaniv’s human rights cases had made international headlines that the CBC finally wrote one story about this issue, in late July.
Killing stories that do not suit one’s own ideological narrative or preference is not limited to the CBC. Neither the CBC nor the so-called “mainstream” media covered the sexually graphic materials that were provided to K-12 children on the government-funded Alberta Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) Network website.
The website was developed by the Institute for Sexual Minority Studies and Services (ISMSS), under the direction of Kris Wells, a professional activist and propagandist who headed the ISMSS. This taxpayer-funded  GSA website provided children with links to “Super practical sex positions everyone can try at home” and “Eight things they teach you at blow job school.” This website also had links to introduce children to the “Zebra” sexual alphabet: ‘A’ is for  Auto-fellatio, ‘F’ is for Felching, ‘U’ is for Urophilia, ‘Y’ is for Yellow and Brown Showers, etc.
Felching is so revolting  (and unhealthy) that no decent website or other publication could even describe this practice; google the term at your own risk. Calgary radio talk-show host Danielle Smith is the only media personality who took note of this story, interviewing one of the parents who had exposed the truth about the GSA website. All other media tried to kill the story by not covering something that might embarrass their ideological allies.
In a similar fashion, the CBC and other “mainstream” media provided no coverage when Wells, a senior advisor to NDP Education Minister David Eggen, outrageously compared Christians to Nazis.
Palpable media bias aside, there are also Press Gallery members who admit to covering the news from a particular angle or perspective, like the Aboriginal Peoples TV, Canadian Catholic News, The Lawyer’s Daily and the left-wing Rabble.ca.
There is nothing wrong with having a perspective, or even a bias per se.  Rather, what is wrong is pretending to be neutral and objective when you are not.
Everybody advocates for a certain perspective.  What differs between media sources is not the existence of bias, but the honesty (or lack thereof) about its bias. I would sooner read progressive views on Rabble.ca and conservative views on Rebel News than supposedly “unbiased” media which actually denies the fact that they adhere to a political ideology.
By rejecting True North and Rebel News as  “actively involved in advocacy” while accepting many media outlets which are also undeniably “actively involved in advocacy,” the Press Gallery is revealing its own bias. Or perhaps the Press Gallery is simply taking its marching orders from the Leaders’ Debate Commission.
The Press Gallery has a Parliamentary email (pressres2@parl.gc.ca)  and receives space from Parliament, exercising immense influence. Its choice to exclude conservative-leaning media organizations threatens a healthy and thriving democracy that tolerates diversity in thought and debate.
As for the Leaders’ Debate Commission, it is clearly a government body. To the extent that the Press Gallery is implementing the will of the Leaders’ Debate Commission, the Press Gallery’s decisions must comply with the Charter. The Charter requires government bodies and agencies to be neutral and to refrain from using ideology as a basis for rewarding friends or punishing enemies.
The Federal Court will consider these issues upon hearing the applications of True North and Rebel News to overturn the decision of the Press Gallery and/or the Leaders’ Debate Commission."

According to the Calgary Herald, “When asked if there was interest in making a similar declaration in Calgary, Coun. Sean Chu laughed before saying there was no way he would let it happen.”
“No way whatsoever. Over my dead body,” said Chu, adding that “pea-cocking” over environmentalism arbitrarily worries people too much.
Councillor Ward Sutherland seems to share the opinion and said that he hasn’t heard anything about such a state of emergency being declared in Calgary.
“From my perspective, I think it’s overly dramatic and I certainly would not favour it,” said Sutherland. “The rationale behind that is simple, we do have an environmental policy that is one of the strongest ones in Canada, and we’ve been moving forward with many initiatives.”
Coun. Shane Keating and Ray Jones agreed, adding that it isn’t the municipal government’s job to act on such calls.
“We can take a number of actions to help the climate but I’m not sure that we’re the right political body to be coming out and declaring things like that,” said Keating.
“The cities that have heavy industries should be addressing it and Calgary does not have a lot of heavy industry,” said Jones.
Two other councillors are more willing to open discussions but have stood firm behind Calgary’s history of being environmentally ahead of the curve.
“Calgary has been the steward of water in Alberta, so we have been very aware of the impacts of climate and we’ve been doing everything we can to mitigate it,” said Coun. Jyoti Gondek.
“It would be an interesting conversation on council given that we’ve, unfortunately, pitted our oil and gas business against our climate goals. I’m personally of the opinion that they are not oppositional conversations to be having,” said Coun. Gian-Carlo Carra."

In a tweet that was shared by several dozen followers, Butts retweeted a claim by the account “Jimmy Nobody” which pointed out that the Conservative website’s domain was being hosted by a company called “Rebel.ca Corp”.
However, Butts forgot to do his homework, since a simple search reveals that the website in question is a common domain host and not the right-wing media company.
Earlier this year, Butts resigned from his position in the Prime Minister Office in the midst of the damning SNC-Lavalin scandal, but has since taken up a position on the prime minister’s campaign team.
Furthermore, ironically the Liberal party’s own website is hosted by the very same Rebel.ca Butts was so quick to smear the Conservatives with.

The judge agreed with the legal counsel of right-wing news outlets Rebel Media and True North that they had established the outlets would face “irreparable harm” if the commission’s rejection of their applications for media passes stood.
The Post Millennial can confirm there is now a signed court order that requires the commission to give accreditation to Andrew Lawton of True North, as well as David Menzies and Keean Bexte of Rebel Media, journalist accreditation to the debate this evening, as well as the French one.

“I’m delighted that the judge granted the application,” said Rebel Media founder and self-described commander Ezra Levant said to The Post Millennial after the hearing. “It was a very high standard [the judge] said was met. You don’t get an emergency injunction easily.
Summit Management Office of Global Affairs and the Parliamentary Press Gallery advised the commission on which journalists and outlets to give accreditation to, eventually the commission only denied True North, The Rebel and two other unnamed outlets.
ADs
Justice Russel Zinn questioned the commission’s lawyers why in the one affidavit the Parliamentary Press Gallery president claimed he decided the two outlets practiced advocacy.
The lawyers for True North and The Rebel argued other outlets such as the Toronto Star also practice advocacy and that some of their journalists tell readers to vote for the Liberals. They also pointed out that the Toronto Star‘s Atkinson Principles tells it journalists to be social justice advocates.
“I think that justice was delivered,” said True North founder and Toronto Sun columnist Candice Malcolm. “We were up against the odds, we we’re going up against the state. And they had their high-priced lawyers, a team of them, they’d been trying to intimidate us all weekend by asking for over-the-top ridiculous things… What the judge ruled today really vindicated us as journalists.”

“…This is not abnormal. This is normal. Abnormal was what they tried to do. And abnormal is the absence of any media association — Canadian Journalists for Free Expression, PEN Canada, The Canadian Association of Journalists, in fact their name was invoked against us,” said Levant.
“The true civil libertarians are no longer on the left, in fact if anything they were used against us by the government. This is normal, this is what the Charter is about,” said Levant.

The Post Millennial has previously reported on Justin Trudeau’s Liberal election campaign barring True North‘s Andrew Lawton from getting accreditation to cover Trudeau.
The Leaders’ Debate Commission had argued news outlets True North and The Rebel should not be allowed into the national debate because they have previously acted in what the commission deemed an advocacy role, such as fundraising and petitions.
ADs
“I think that the independence of the commission has definitely come into question,” said Malcolm.
“Everyone know what is going on with the Parliamentary Press Gallery. They’re biased. They consider themselves the in-crowd and they are trying to prevent competition and other interesting upstart media companies from coming in with a different perspective, showing a different side of the story, appealing to a different segment of the Canadian population. And they’re trying to act as gatekeepers to stop us, and they failed.”
Critics of the commission’s decision also pointed out how it accredited environmental-focused media outlet the National Observer, which also does fundraising. The Leaders’ Debate Commission also accredited state-sponsored news outlets from Vietnam and Qatar. The commission was founded by the Trudeau government in 2018.
ADs
Numerous incidents involving the police and both Rebel and True North journalists made headlines over the past week, as journalists from the conservative, independent outlets tried to do their job on the campaign trail.
Justice Zinn said he would give the reasons for his decision at a later date as the commission barred the news outlets the last business day possible before the first debate, which resulted in the emergency injunction occurring hours before the debate started. He will also consider awarding costs of legal counsel to True North and The Rebel.
“I’m very, very proud with Canada right now,” Levant said shortly after the judge gave his decision.

The commission did not respond to request for comment before publishing.

Party leaders have devoted valuable pre-election time to campaign in the province and to persuade voters to pick their respective party at the ballot.
Among the key issues British Columbians care about are the environment, housing, and poverty reduction.
In total British Columbia has 42 seats which are up for grab this year. In terms of seat quantity, the province sits third right behind Quebec (78) and Ontario (121).
In 2015, the Liberal party came out on top with a total of 17 seats, followed by the NDP with 14, the Conservatives coming in at only 10 seats, while the Greens were able to secure one final seat in a snap by-election this year.
This year’s election has seen a shift in the political arena for the province, partly due to the fact that voters will be thinking about the performance of their sitting NDP government, as well as voting on whether they feel Justin Trudeau has adequately served the interests of Western Canada during his tenure.
Here are five B.C. ridings, The Post Millennial will be keeping an eye out for in this upcoming election.
Burnaby South
Readers might remember that at the beginning of this year, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh was able to secure a parliamentary seat in British Columbia in the first of a series of byelections.
This time around, Singh will be facing some new and familiar opponents in Burnaby South. Conservative candidate Jay Shin will remain on the ballot after coming in a comfortable third place in the byelection. For the Liberals, Neelam Brar was tapped as the candidate after former runner-up Richard Lee resigned from the candidacy.
For the Greens, Brennan Wauters will be representing the party. As for the PPC, the party has picked Al Rawdah to replace former candidate Laura Lynn Tyler Thompson.
While elections featuring party leaders tend to be predictable, predictions indicate that Singh’s re-election might not be as secure as convention might predict.
According to the politics analysis website 338canada, the riding is a tossup between the three major federal parties. Just behind Singh, sits Conservative candidate Shin, followed closely behind by Liberal Brar.
With a debate for the riding coming up on October 17, voters have an opportunity to mull over their options one last time before casting a vote.
Vancouver Granville
With talks of the SNC-Lavalin scandal still ruminating on the campaign trail, the riding of former justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould will likely receive national attention.
After being ejected from the Liberal caucus, Wilson-Raybould will be contending to be re-elected for her seat as an independent candidate.
According to the latest poll by Mainstreet Research, Wilson-Raybould is polling just behind Liberal candidate Taleeb Noormohamed. Currently, the Liberals have the edge with 28.6% of the vote, while Wilson-Raybould is trailing closely behind at 26%.
Considering the fact that nearly 11% of people in the riding are undecided, these voters might make or break Wilson-Raybould’s bid for re-election.
Esquimalt–Saanich–Sooke
This Victoria island riding might be the tightest four-way race in the entire province.
If 2015 is an indicator of how this year’s election will go, the island riding will be a fierce fight for each party.
The Greens, who were the first to get their signage up when the campaign began, hope to have a serious shot at electing another Green Party MP in the province. Currently, according to 338canada, Green Party candidate David Merner is in the lead with a projected 27.9 percent of the vote followed closely behind by the other three federal parties.
All four parties are currently polling above 20% and stand to take the lead within a few percentage points of each other."

This is wild. The Debates Commission came up with its criteria for accreditation on Thursday. They didn’t bother to make it public though. pic.twitter.com/HDm6QA34ms— Candice Malcolm (@CandiceMalcolm) October 7, 2019
The “Guiding principles for accreditation of media organizations and journalists at the leaders’ debates” document states the commission had “turned to” the Summit Management Office of Global Affairs and the Parliamentary Press Gallery as advisors on who to approve as journalists.
Ultimately more than 86 CBC/Radio-Canada journalists alone were given accreditation by the commission, which was created by the Trudeau government in 2018.
Critics of the process have pointed out that environmental activist news outlet the National Observer has been accredited, along with state-funded foreign news organizations Al Jazeera and Vietnam News Agency.
Trudeau has already created headlines for ducking out of two other debates not run by his government-created election commission.
The Leaders’ Debate Commission’s belated journalism accreditation guidelines were made public when The Rebel and True North slapped the government with an injunction to get themselves accredited for the debate, which starts at 7 p.m. EST Monday night.
A judge will be hearing the case at 3 p.m. today, which The Post Millennial will be reporting on.
The Post Millennial has reached out to the Debate Commission to answer why the guidelines were only prepared on October 3rd.

“After media reports revealed that Justin Trudeau wore blackface during an event at West Point Grey Academy, Canadians have been asking why exactly Justin Trudeau left his teaching job at the school,” the press release starts.
CPC press release questions why Justin Trudeau left Point Grey Academy and details different reasons given for why Trudeau left over the years. Release ends with ""Trudeau will have the opportunity tonight to tell Canadians the truth."" Is Scheer going to ask? #cdnpoli #Elxn43 pic.twitter.com/rRCA8InD4h— Mercedes Stephenson (@MercedesGlobal) October 7, 2019
“It’s understandable why people have questions, after all Trudeau’s story changed four times since 2001.”
This most recent CPC line of attack comes on the heels of Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer being attacked by his Liberal opponents last week–in what has become an increasingly dirty campaign of personal attacks–for still holding his U.S. citizenship and inflating his resume by claiming he was an insurance broker.
Last Friday, a Globe and Mail reporter asked Trudeau why he left and if he signed a confidentiality agreement. He dodged both questions, but when pressed he later denied signing a confidentiality agreement.
The CPC press release also points to two conflicting news reports from 2001, one saying he left to become a professional speaker, the other to take another teaching job at a public school.
It then goes on to cite his autobiography, in which Trudeau claimed he left West Point Grey Academy after he had encouraged a student to write an opinion piece for the school newspaper on the dress code that the school’s administration disapproved of, prompting him to quit on principle.
The press release also references Trudeau’s comments from Friday where he said, “Because I was moving on with my life.”
The latest CPC attack was released the morning before the official English leaders’ debate, leaving some political analysts to wonder if this is something Scheer plans to bring up during the debate.
The Post Millennial reported last week that the Globe and Mail and other news outlets have been looking into Trudeau’s time and departure from West Point Grey Academy since it came to light he wore blackface at one of the school’s fundraisers.
Toronto Sun columnist Candice Malcolm reported on other aspects of Trudeau’s time teaching at the private school, including how he was not listed as a math teacher in the yearbook, despite claiming to have been one there, as well as that he was a yearbook instructor the year the pictures of him in blackface were published."

The Post Millennial has previously reported that the debate commission–an organization put together by the Trudeau government–has maintained that newsgroups like the True North Centre should not be allowed into the national debate because they have previously acted in an advocacy role.
In response, True North journalist Andrew Lawton said, “The government must uphold both freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and that means for all media outlets, even with editorial biases the government may not like. The debates commission says ‘advocacy’ is the problem: even if that accurately reflected True North‘s work, it wouldn’t be a consistent position by the commission, which accredited Toronto Star despite its mission of ‘advocating for social and economic justice.'”
The Star is, of course, not the only outlet to maintain a mission statement that involves advocating for certain issues. For example, the American outlet Buzzfeed maintains a policy that is extremely similar.
While many organizations outside of True North Centre maintain areas of advocacy, the refusal to accredit organizations like it becomes even more outrageous when you consider that Al Jazeera and Vietnam News Agency have both been approved.
Both Al Jazeera and Vietnam News Agency are state-funded foreign organizations.
Al Jazeera is owned by Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s ruling family.
Vietnam News states on their own website that, “the Vietnam News Agency is a government agency with the function as the state news agency that publishes and broadcasts official information and documents of the Party and State; provides information in service of the Party’s leadership and the State’s management.”
The title for the highest-ranking position within Vietnam News is General Director Member of the Party Central Committee, meaning the highest-ranking member of the news agency actually also serves in the government.

The Liberal candidate, Jaime Battiste, was revealed by the Toronto Sun to have penned numerous racist, sexist, and homophobic social media posts, dating back to 2012.
Such posts include, a tweet that reads, “Cleaning, Folding, Cooking, Feeling like an Epic Fail that i havent found a woman who can stand me long enough to do this for me. #FML”
Another from 2012 reads, “Why do I assume every skinny aboriginal girl is on crystal meth or pills?”
He also made jokes about “accidentally sexually assault[ing]” a cast member if he were on the set of the television show Cheers.
Additionally, Battiste said that watching men’s tennis is essentially like “watchin gay porn,” which he coupled with the hashtags “#nothomophobicJS” and “#tennis sucks”.
In response to the damning article, Battiste apologized, put his Twitter on private mode, and wrote a statement to the Sun.
As the Toronto Sun reports, “He stated he thought the “crude jokes” were “funny at the time” but now realizes they were “offensive.” He also stated: “These were things I said during difficult times in my life, and they are not a reflection of my beliefs or who I am today. I apologize unreservedly.”
However, despite his admission of holding highly offensive views in the past, the Liberal Party has no intention of removing their candidate from the race or their party.
According to 680 News, when asked, Justin Trudeau said he does not condone his candidate’s behaviour, but is happy that he apologized.
“Trudeau called the language in the posts unacceptable, but that he is pleased Battiste has apologized unreservedly,” reports 680 News.
“Trudeau sidestepped a question about whether he feels limited in his ability to censure candidates for past racist behaviours after photos and a video emerged in the first week of the campaign showing the Liberal leader wearing blackface makeup.”

This number was later revised to 85,000, of which 74,000 were removed, according to Elections Canada.
Furthermore, it is possible that some illegal, non-Canadian voters may have slipped through the vetting process during the 2015 election, reports CTV News, and many non-Canadians remain registered to vote in Atlantic Canada.
Elections Canada came under similar criticism last year when it was revealed that new immigrants to Canada, who had yet to receive citizenship, had been given voter information cards and had been logged in their database.
According to the Toronto Sun, Jacqueline, a woman who arrived in Western Canada in 2017 as a refugee, had been sent a letter from elections Canada in 2018, urging her to register ahead of schedule so that she could vote in an upcoming election. This is despite refugees needing to be in the country for three years before they’re able to apply for citizenship.
“I don’t know where they got her information to begin with, but they sent her a registration card,” Jacqueline’s husband, who was interviewed because his wife still struggles with English, told the Sun.
“She’s taking ESL classes, we haven’t even been in the country a year and a half, and the Liberals are sending a vote registration card.”
The husband went on to say that this is quite common among immigrant families, and that he personally knows several families which have received similar letters and registration cards.
According to the Toronto Sun, a spokesperson for Elections Canada says that they “compile voter registration lists from a number of sources, including the Canada Revenue Agency, driver’s license agencies, provincial voter lists, and the federal immigration department.”
“From time to time, a non-citizen may inadvertently be included in the register and may, therefore, receive a voter information card in error. In the rare case that a non-citizen gets a voter information card, we ask that they call their local Elections Canada office and ask to be removed from the National Register of Electors,” said Natasha Gauthier of Elections Canada in 2018.
“It is not illegal for a non-citizen to be on the register in error,” she continued. “It is an offence under the Canada Elections Act for a non-citizen to vote, or to apply to register to vote, knowing they are not qualified to do so,” said Gauthier.
In response to criticism over the possibility that non-Canadians were being registered to illegally vote, Elections Canada took to Twitter to clear up the misunderstanding.

The voter information card is not currently accepted as ID. At no time have electors been allowed to vote by showing a voter information card as their only piece of ID.— Elections Canada (@ElectionsCan_E) October 9, 2018
Bill C-76, currently before Parliament, would allow the voter information card to be used as a proof of address. Elections Canada would not accept the voter information card alone–it would have to be shown with another accepted piece of ID that proves their identity.— Elections Canada (@ElectionsCan_E) October 9, 2018
The problem and subsequent concerns have persisted well into the current year, even though the election is only two weeks away.
“You must be a Canadian citizen in order to vote so the best thing to do to help Elections Canada improve the list and correct the mistakes is to either go to an Elections Canada office and say ‘will you please remove me from the list, I’m not a Canadian.’ or you can phone,” said Francoise Enguehard of Elections Canada. “We have a 1-800 number and you will help greatly in making the list better.”
According to True North News, new legislation permits non-Canadians to vote, though illegally, and they can bypass vetting processes “by providing a voter information card and bank statement or utility bill and student ID card or other combinations of paperwork that do not require photo verification.”
If a person does not unregister, votes, and are caught, they could face a fine of up to $5,000 and may have to serve jail time.
However, even if someone lacks these documents, they still may be able to vote if another person vouches for their identity as Canadian citizens.
The Post Millennial reached out to Elections Canada for comment and received a response.
According to Elections Canada, being on the National Register of Electors (NRoE) is “not a ticket to vote.” The list of people on the NRoE is aggregated from the Canada Revenue Agency, the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC); provincial/territorial diver’s license bureaus’ provincial and territorial electoral management bodies; and when you register to vote or update your registration with Elections Canada.
When asked about the number of non-Canadians who are currently or were on the NRoE, Elections Canada’s Matthew McKenna wrote the following:
In April 2019, for the first time, IRCC was able to provide Elections Canada with information on permanent residents and foreign nationals.  Elections Canada was able to initially identify approximately 103,000 potential non-citizens in the Register. This number subsequently increased to 112,000 following further analysis. Based on revised data sent by IRCC, the number was revised again, to 85,000, from which, approximately 74 000 were removed. Others were confirmed to be Canadian citizens. Elections Canada is continuing to analyze the data and cross-reference it with other data, and in accordance with the Canada Elections Act, we are taking steps to verify the eligibility of these individuals and remove those who are not eligible to vote.  Matthew McKenna,  Media Relations and Issues Management for Elections Canada
The Post Millennial also asked about the possibility of non-Canadians illegally voting in the 2015 election, especially considering how many non-Canadians were only recently discovered on the NRoE.
They said that they only have “immediate access to information regarding only those electors who voted at advance polls, those who voted by special ballot, and those who registered to vote on polling day, which represents approximately 30 per cent of all votes cast.”
Having access to only 30 per cent of those votes is something that Elections Canada says they are taking “very seriously.”
As Elections Canada writes:
The importance of taking our time to do this was confirmed recently when it was determined that due to an IRCC system error, historical data was included in the information shared by IRCC with Elections Canada (see the note above about the initial number of 103,000 being ultimately revised to 85,000, of which we were able to remove 74,000). As a result, some eligible electors were mistakenly identified as potential non-citizens. This reinforces the need to analyze the data thoroughly, to cross-reference it with other data. A complete review of the voting records would require Elections Canada to open thousands of poll bags from the 2015 federal election, alone. This would be a massive undertaking that would jeopardize the conduct of the current federal election if it were to take place at this time. Matthew McKenna,  Media Relations and Issues Management for Elections Canada
This means that of those identified, only 11,000 were genuine Canadian citizens, while 74,000 had nearly managed to slip through vetting, and it is unclear how many may still be unidentified and trying to vote. Furthermore, it appears they are uncertain how many non-Canadians managed to bypass the vetting process during the 2015 election.
As the current election progresses, Elections Canada says that they are prioritizing “removing confirmed non-citizens from the Register now that we have the data and putting measures in place to detect and prevent non-citizens from voting in the 2019 federal election.”"

In years past, when making my political views known at dinners, parties, or over drinks with friends, people tend to be open to, if not remarkably receptive to my convictions. Expanding healthcare to include universal pharma and dental care feels like a logical next step for a country that prides itself on its public healthcare.
Establishing a peaceful and principled foreign policy makes sense in an increasingly small world, rocked by the fallout from the United States’s blunderous ventures in the Middle East.
A program to help relieve student debt is a visceral issue for my peers, mostly students, and millennials who themselves have been saddled with seemingly insurmountable student debt in the name of education and nebulous future job prospects. Yet once an election year rolls around, I find myself hearing a very different story.
It’s no secret that young people tend to lean progressive, and with good reason. If nothing else, consider naked self-interest: Young people tend to be the lowest earners in society, plagued more often than not either by crushing student debt, or in the case of those without secondary education, laborious, insecure, low-or-minimum wage jobs.
Simply put, it isn’t hard to convince people that mass politics of labour focused on building up living standards, opportunities, and a social safety net have something to offer them.
Yet in so many ways, it seems that a writ of election is accompanied by some magic spell that falls over the land, turning ambition to contentedness, hope to resignation, and youthful defiance to submission. “I know,” I hear them say, “that Justin Trudeau declares his support for better climate policy out one side of his mouth while approving pipelines out the other.”
“I know Trudeau claimed to want to raise taxes on the rich to benefit the rest of Canadians while his 2015 tax law ended up being a net tax cut on the highest earners, but aren’t the Conservatives worse?”
This question is the product of a false dichotomy that voters cling to: you are either Liberal or Conservative. I see where they’re coming from. It’s hard not to. If the Liberals are the lesser of two evils, are they not, then, the obvious choice for someone simply seeking to do the most good?
I maintain that no, they are not, and that moreover, this line of thought is fundamentally flawed.
Opting for the lesser of two evils is quite reasonable, so long as the choice is only being made once. This choice, however, is not being made once. This choice is being made many times, most likely once every four years for the rest of our lives, and the outcome of this election can inform decisions in the next.
The fact is, the Liberals expect that they can cow the people of this country who have the audacity to demand a safer, happier, more egalitarian society into submission by maintaining the specter of a Conservative government.
They will convince people that the stakes of each election are higher than the last, and as they do so, they will demand just another inch of compromise. Just one more concession to big business instead of working people. One more deal with human-rights-violating nations abroad instead of the victimized people Canada can and should stand up for.
The two parties that have dominated politics in this country for one hundred and fifty-two years will become more indistinguishable than they already are, and we’ll all be worse off for it; we’ve all been worse off for it.
I don’t blame people for being preoccupied with defeating the Conservatives. I want that too.
That’s why I believe in building a popular movement based on real, tangible policy that makes peoples’ lives measurably better. Comparing the platforms of both status-quo parties, we see the Liberals, in page 14 of their official platform, declaring their intention to “take the critical next steps to implement national universal pharmacare.”
This sounds nice, but upon inspection, it leaves questions unanswered; what are these next steps?
How many steps are there? How long will Canadians be without universal coverage before the program is implemented? Compare this to the NDP, who commit unambiguously to “[the creation of] a national pharmacare program that provides universal, public, comprehensive coverage to everyone in Canada.” Here, there are no vague “steps” that must be taken, just an explicit commitment to real policy.
Regarding the transition to a greener economy, the Liberals promise a confusing patchwork of vague commitments to developing renewable industries, without a mention of ongoing subsidies for the oil industry. In contrast, the NDP flatly declares their intention to end subsidies for fossil fuel industries, as well as support for renewable industries and the creation of a carbon market.
Now, I know the response to this. “What does better, simpler, more effective policy mean if you’ve never formed government?” The answer is that it means quite a lot. In addition to representing and working with governments at the provincial level, universal healthcare was established in this country directly thanks to the NDP. Additionally, policies like unemployment insurance, old-age pensions, and civil rights legislation can trace their origins to the NDP’s forerunner, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, who forced the hand of a reluctant Liberal Party through their control of the balance of power.
These achievements are important to a lot of people, and none of them would have been realized without the NDP having a presence in Ottawa, through good times and bad. The Liberals and Conservatives would be very happy if that presence were gone, or were even to falter once.
So, is it possible that a strategic vote by the supporters of the NDP could prevent a less than ideal government? Sure. Is that worth risking the destruction of a principled third party that works to give ordinary Canadians a voice in Ottawa?
Not at all. On October 21st, I’ll be voting NDP.

May was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1954 and emigrated with her family to Nova Scotia in 1973. In 1978 she became a citizen of Canada.
But did she ever give up her U.S. citizenship?
Losing U.S. citizenship is a complex process as the government of the United States generally operates on the assumption that all American-born citizens intend to retain their citizenship forever unless a desire to renounce it is explicitly made. This is because U.S. citizenship for every person born on U.S. soil has been a guaranteed constitutional right since 1868, when the 14th Amendment was passed.
Despite this, there are a lot of urban legends floating around that suggest U.S. citizenship can be lost easily or “automatically” simply by becoming a citizen of another country, serving in a foreign army, becoming a politician in another country, or similar expressions of a “new loyalty.”
Over the years, Elizabeth May has offered up a number of similarly confused and contradictory theories of why she thinks she is not a U.S. citizen anymore. All seem to rely far more on layman’s hunch than law.
In a 2012 tweet, she claimed “I am only a Canadian citizen since renouncing US citizenship,” but in 2014 she clarified that, in her opinion, “Becoming a Canadian citizen and swearing allegiance to #Queen=renouncing,” which is not legally accurate. Thousands of people born in the United States have retained their U.S. citizenship after moving to Canada and formally becoming Canadian citizens, a process which often includes taking an oath to Elizabeth II.
In a February 2014 letter to the Globe and Mail, responding to a previous letter-writer who had described her as a dual “Canadian-American” citizen May replied “ I am not a dual citizen. I am a Canadian citizen and have been since 1978. Any doubt about citizenship is resolved in swearing the oath to Her Majesty the Queen in becoming a Member of Parliament. The U.S. accepts such acts as renunciation, lest there be any doubt.” A few months later, an article in the Vancouver Sun noted that May “never formally obtained” a Certificate of Loss of Nationality—the legal document held by ex-American citizens who have successfully completed the renunciation process—and instead simply “believes” she lost her US citizenship “when she became a member of Parliament in Canada.”
According to the United States Bureau of Consular Affairs, however, while running for or obtaining a “policy-level” position in a foreign government may be a “potentially expatriating act” for U.S. citizens, the U.S. government “will seek to ascertain the individual’s intent to retain or relinquish his or her U.S. nationality upon accepting the policy level position with a foreign government.” In other words, the U.S. citizen must be proactive. “An individual assuming such a position who wishes to relinquish U.S. Nationality,” the USBCA’s website continues, “may come to Post and follow the required steps to complete the Certificate of Loss of Nationality application process.”
The Post Millennial spoke to two immigration lawyers who said an American has to go through a formal process to get rid of their U.S. citizenship, and if May didn’t do this she is almost certainly still legally considered an American citizen by the U.S. government.
A relevant example would be U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson, who was born in New York in 1964 but immigrated to England with his family as a child. Despite going on to serve in British politics for decades, including as a member of parliament, mayor of London, and cabinet minister (all of which, incidentally, presumably involved taking oaths to Queen Elizabeth), Johnson remained a legal U.S. citizen until 2016, when, as part of his pursuit of the British prime ministership, he went through the formal process of renouncing his American citizenship.
Johnson’s decision to renounce his citizenship was also partially motivated by tax reasons—an increasingly common reason for U.S.-born persons living abroad to opt-out of their American citizenship. The U.S. government expects all U.S. citizens to file a tax return regardless of where they live.
In 2014 Johnson described renouncing his citizenship as “very hard.” The process was apparently only finalized after he paid all outstanding taxes.
When asked for comment by The Post Millennial a Green Party spokesperson claimed May’s “American citizenship was revoked when she became Canadian in 1978, as per U.S. laws at the time.”
The Green Party did not respond to request for clarification on which “laws” May is referring to and The Post Millennial was unable to find any evidence of “laws” that automatically revoked US citizenship from Americans who became citizens of another country between 1954 and 1978.
Since American citizenship for people born in the United States is a constitutional right, the U.S. government cannot “revoke” it from people through simple legislation. In 1967 Supreme Court ruled in the case of Afroyim v. Rusk that Congress cannot revoke US citizenship without the voluntary consent of the citizen.
The U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs states that a “U.S. citizen may naturalize in a foreign state without any risk to his or her U.S. Citizenship.”
Though becoming a citizen of another country can be used as an act of an intent to renounce U.S. citizenship, since the U.S. government cannot revoke citizenship unilaterally, the burden of proof remains on the American to prove she consciously and purposely became a citizen of another country in order to renounce her U.S. citizenship. All acts of deliberate citizenship renunciation must be done with the awareness of a local U.S. diplomatic or consular office. The Green Party did not reply to a follow-up question regarding if May had ever applied for or received diplomatic confirmation of her alleged loss of citizenship.
Andrew Scheer’s attitude to his birthright citizenship has apparently borne more resemblance to Johnson’s legal carefulness than May’s flippant disinterest. According to recent media reports, Scheer has always filed a perfunctory tax return with the IRS over the years, registered with U.S. selective service, and initiated the formal bureaucratic process of renouncing his citizenship in August.
Last week May spoke to reporters on Scheer’s citizenship, and continued her claim that her citizenship was revoked, which was unquestioningly reported as the truth by outlets like CTV.
But is that the truth?"
0,2019-10-06T10:41:12.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/whoever-wins-the-election-will-inherit-a-brutally-divided-nation,Whoever wins the election will inherit a brutally divided nation,"It’s safe to say that at the halfway point, this has been the most divisive election in recent memory.
The negativity has been pervasive, the media bias has been through the roof, and it’s only getting worse as Election Day nears.
As a result, it’s clear that whoever wins the election will inherit a brutally divided nation.
While all the parties have been negative, there’s no doubt that the Liberals have been the most ruthless, basing their entire early campaign around digging up mistakes by Conservative candidates in their past, exposing those mistakes, and then using it to try and demonize Conservative Canadians.
Now, the Liberals are being forced even further into the gutter, as Trudeau’s blackface scandal and ongoing ethical problems have made it impossible for them to run a positive campaign.
And in order to survive and have a chance at winning, the other parties have been forced to try and match the ruthlessness of the Liberals, a logical strategy based on the reality they face.
Unfortunately for Canada, the divisions we are seeing nationwide will last long after the election, and could even threaten our nation itself.
Western Alienation is surging, and a Liberal minority government could lead our nation to a crisis point.
If the Conservatives win the election but don’t get a majority, then a coalition of less popular parties could form. Of course, those less popular parties are all against any expansion of the Canadian energy industry, and the Greens, NDP, and Bloc all oppose the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion.
That means any Liberal coalition with the other parties would almost certainly be a death blow to Canada’s energy industry, while simultaneously ramping up government spending, spending that would be paid for by extracting even more transfer payments from Alberta and Saskatchewan. That would cause support for Western separation to surge through the roof, leading our nation to a dangerous national unity crisis.
Also, it would be profoundly undemocratic for the Conservatives to be blocked from taking power if they win the most seats, since none of the other parties are explicitly campaigning on a coalition.
Make no mistake, if the Conservatives win the most seats and the most votes, any coalition against that would represent an undemocratic seizure of power by backroom political operatives, something that explicitly goes against how Canada is supposed to function.
So, if you think things are negative now, this may look like a walk in the park compared to what awaits our country in the days, weeks, and months ahead."

A real moment. Singh, pledging the $1.8B needed for clean water in First Nations communities, is asked if he’s writing a “blank cheque” for all indigenous people. His response is as measure and firm as we have come to expect of Jagmeet. pic.twitter.com/roxOkrYY8H— Tom Parkin (@TomPark1n) October 5, 2019
Singh’s response was to a Global News journalist asking, “Are you just writing a blank cheque for all problems for all Indigenous communities across the country [if] you get into office?”
Singh hadn’t actually pledged unlimited funds to Indigenous communities, but $1.8 billion to address the longstanding crisis of undrinkable tap water on Indigenous reserves that has been a problem unaddressed by consecutive Liberal and Conservative governments.
“Yes, they deserve clean drinking water. Yes, we can make it happen. It’s a matter of priority, and I’m going to do it,” Singh continued after admonishing the journalist for asking if it was too expensive.
During the 2015 election campaign, Justin Trudeau promised First Nations that the Liberals would tackle the issue, but once in power his government largely failed to deliver on the file.
Since Singh, a visible minority, gave an impassioned response to the news Trudeau repeatedly wore blackface, political observers have been surprised at how much the NDP leader has stepped up his game. The last two years Singh helmed the party, pundits largely said he didn’t have the political chops to lead.
Earlier this week he also deftly handled a racist Montreal heckler telling him to cut off his turban.
A reinvigorated Singh seems to be getting left-wing Canadians attention. Some polls, including the latest one from Campaign Research, show Singh’s job approval rating from voters shot up from 22% at the start of Sept. to 33% at the beginning of Oct.
In other polling, support for Trudeau and Liberals plummeted with Indigenous voters, according to a poll conducted by Environics Research and commissioned by Aboriginal People’s Television Network (APTN).
The survey found only 21% of Indigenous voters now support the Liberals, down from 40% in the 2015 election. The poll also found the Conservatives have 26%, NDP have 17% and the Green Party have 16%. Interestingly though, Environics Research also found 58% of Indigenous voters said they could still change their mind before E-day.
Trudeau took heat from Indigenous communities earlier this year when he flippantly told an Indigenous protester “Thank you for your donation” when she called him out for not getting clean drinking water for Grassy Narrows.
Indigenous people were also disappointed in Trudeau’s Liberals when news broke on Friday the Trudeau government is challenging a human rights ruling that the Canadian government must compensate First Nations children abused due to failures of the on-reserve, under-funded child and family services and child welfare system.
The Trudeau Liberals have also been criticized for getting rid of financial transparency on reserves and the disorganized Missing, Murdered Indigenous Women Inquiry, which saw a series of people quit."

At a press conference earlier this week discussing the Conservatives 25% cut to foreign aid spending, Scheer seemed to suggest that the Trudeau policy of funding abortions in other countries, sometimes even in African nations where the practice is illegal, would continue.
“We are not reopening this debate at any level. What this is about is which types of countries will receive financial assistance, and so groups that are receiving funding will continue to receive funding going into the future,” Scheer told reporters.
This announcement came as a shock to many of the party’s more socially conservative supporters who recognized this as a clear departure from the former Harper government’s maternal and child health plan which explicitly excluded abortion funding.
However, a number of Conservative candidates (technically not currently MP’s because of the election) have come forward to say that this was a misunderstanding and clearly not what the Conservative Party stands for.
Cathay Wagantall, a longtime Conservative MP from Saskatchewan told The Post Millennial in an email statement that “As Conservatives our focus is to provide care for children in places of poverty and conflict. Trudeau and the Liberals are attempting to colonize other countries by funding abortion where it is not legal or desired. As our leader has said, we will not be granting funding for divisive projects like abortion overseas.”
Another Conservative candidate, Arnold Viersen of Alberta, said, “The leader has always been clear: We will focus on protecting children in conflict zones, providing clean drinking water, and other essential aid, and we will not be granting new funding for divisive projects like abortion overseas. This has been a long standing Conservative Party of Canada policy.”
Rosemarie Falk, a young mother and social worker recently elected in a byelection under the Conservative banner only two years ago, also spoke out saying: “Andrew Scheer has clearly stated that a Conservative government will focus on policies that unite Canadians. That position with respect to foreign aid spending is also clearly stated in the Conservative Party’s policy document. Aid investment to coerce the poor and vulnerable into abortion does not fit that criterion.”
Scheer is supposed to clarify whether as PM his government would still fund foreign abortions at a scrum after an event wraps up in North York on Friday at 8:30 p.m.
Right Now, the influential political group that works to get pro life candidates elected across Canada, slammed Scheer’s comments saying: “Despite Scheer being more personally pro-life than Harper, his policies on this issue have been significantly worse during this election campaign. If he’s only trying to appeal to progressive voters, he will have a much more difficult time of winning in key swing ridings across the country.”
“Pro-life Canadians make up a significant portion of the Conservative Party’s donors, volunteers, candidates, and most importantly, voters. If Andrew Scheer wants that continued support, he must clearly and definitively stick with the majority of his party and voting base by promising not to funding abortions overseas.”
“You don’t beat Justin Trudeau by adopting his policies, especially when he has been found guilty of giving money to organizations that perform illegal abortions overseas on women without the use of anesthesia.”
These comments come on the heels of last’s night debate hosted by the Archdioses of Toronto where abortion once again came up a a hot topic. The Conservative representative there, Albertan candidate Garnett Genuis, walked back Scheer’s comments when speaking to the media following the debate.
Genuis said that while a Conservative government would have to respect any legally binding obligations, they would not be using taxpayer dollars to fund a “divisive issue” like abortion internationally and would instead focus the funding on “improving access to clean water, nutrition, and helping children in conflict zones.”
The Liberal government announced in June of this year that it would be investing an additional $750 million into “sexual and reproductive health rights” (including abortion services) over and above the $650 million for the same causes over three years announced in 2017."

Criticism of his citizenship came early in the week from the Globe and Mail. In response, Scheer says that he had always planned on relinquishing his U.S. citizenship before the election and that, having grown up in Canada his whole life, he has always been Canadian first and foremost.
“Like millions of Canadians, one of my parents (was) born in another country,” he said. “I met with representatives from the embassy in August and announced I was renouncing my citizenship and submitted the paperwork to start that process.
“I was born in Canada,” he said. “I’ve lived here, I’ve moved to Saskatchewan, I’m raising my children here.”
Scheer was questioned further by reporters on Friday on why “he never told anyone about his dual citizenship.”
In response, Scheer said, “No one’s ever asked me before,” seemingly because it wasn’t relevant — it isn’t unusual for Canadians to have two or more citizenships.
“I’ve never tried to hide that,” Scheer told reporters in Halifax. “I’ve never been asked about it by Canadians. My father has always been open about where he comes from. I haven’t been asked about it.”
On the question of why he didn’t renounce his dual citizenship until just before the election, Scheer said, “I was focused on other things. I was rebuilding the party, getting ready for the election, working on the platform. It was always my intention to do it before the election.”
Scheer also says that despite having a U.S. citizenship, he has never voted in an American election, partook in American politics, renewed his American passport, but that he has filed U.S. taxes, according to a Conservative Party spokesperson.
According to the Toronto Star, he has never been a member of the National Rifle Association, and he has only made income in Canada, despite having to file U.S. tax returns with the IRS. He is also registered for the U.S. military draft, which is a requirement for most U.S. citizens.
Despite these assurances, Scheer has come under heat from the Liberal Party for what they say is apparent dishonesty with voters, claiming that Canadians aren’t sure who Scheer really is.
In a statement reported by CTV News, the Liberals said Scheer has been “fundamentally dishonest with Canadians about who he is.”
“Scheer’s hidden his core personal positions, he hid facts about his career and education, and now he’s been caught hiding his American citizenship even while ridiculing others for holding dual citizenship,” the statement reads.
The ridicule which this statement is referring to is Scheer’s questioning of the dual citizenship and potential dual loyalties of former governor general Michaëlle Jean in 2005.
“I have a few quick questions for anyone who thinks that Michaëlle Jean is a good choice to be our next GG,” Scheer wrote. “What are her qualifications? What experience does she have that would assist her to carry out her duties as our head of state, including the potential to be a referee in a minority government situation?”
Additionally, Scheer asked Jean if it was appropriate to hold a French citizenship while running for governor general of Canada.
However, Scheer isn’t the only Canadian leader with U.S. citizenship at one point. Green Party leader Elizabeth May spent most of her child as an American and says she renounced her citizenship when she became a Canadian citizen in 1978.
“It doesn’t matter to Parliament, but I think it matters to Canadians,” May said in the statement to CTV News. “I’m in a position as leader of a federal political party to potentially become the prime minister, and I think it’s important to know that your prime minister has no other allegiances.”
The previous Harper government also criticized others for having dual citizenship, especially former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion and former NDP leader Tom Mulcair for holding dual citizenship with France and holding public office.
“When asked about Mulcair’s citizenship, Harper said in 2015 it was up to Mulcair to decide whether to keep the French passport or give it up,” CTV News reproted.
“In my case, as I say, I’m very clear. I’m a Canadian and only a Canadian,” Harper said at the time.
Scheer hasn’t apologized for holding dual citizenship and views it as a personal choice to renounce it, as well as being important to solidifying public trust with voters. However, given the lengthy process of renouncing one’s citizenship with the U.S., it isn’t clear whether this decision will be finalized before the election on October 21.
“I’m waiting to hear back from the U.S. embassy but that is certainly the intention,” Scheer said."

What you are witnessing in the videos above is people within our country acting as agents for Communist China, intimidating people who support Canadian values and the rights we cherish as Canadians.
This must not be allowed.
These supporters of Communist China don’t have the right to intimidate, harass, threaten, and tear down the signs of people expressing a different view.
And this goes even further.
Our “leaders” must begin speaking out against this.
Communist China’s ruthless government is doing everything possible to influence and dominate politics around the world, and anyone who facilitates that effort is showing profound disloyalty to Canada.
The reality is, if someone wants to support Communist China, they should be encouraged to book a plane ticket, leave our country, and go live in the Communist State they love so much.
This represents a stark failure of integration, as it seems there are a growing number of people in our country who have a loyalty to a foreign state—a state that is treating Canada like garbage and is opposed to the values we hold dear.
The biggest victims of this are the many Canadians who came here from China because they wanted to live freely, have the right to express themselves, and live a better life. That is who our leaders should be standing up for, and they should never be allowed to be threatened or intimidated for expressing their rights as Canadians.
It’s as simple as this: If someone wants to live in Communist China, get on a damn plane and go live there, don’t bring that authoritarian garbage mindset into our country."

Moderated by veteran political journalist Don Newman, the debate participants from the Green, Conservative, PPC, NDP and Liberal parties squared off in front of a crowd of 1,200 in the John Bassett Theatre in downtown Toronto, the largest live audience for a federal debate so far this campaign season.
Party representatives included incumbent candidates Garnett Genius (CPC) and Francesco Sorbara (LPC), as well as candidates Dan Turcotte (GPC), Matthew Green (NDP) and David Millard Haskell (PPC).
The debate touched on a number of topics of interest to voters across the political spectrum including poverty, Christian persecution, human dignity, immigration, refugees and the environment.
The Archdiocese of Toronto is the largest diocese in Canada, containing two million Catholics and 225 churches in an area stretching from Toronto to Georgian Bay.
After Cardinal Collins made opening remarks touching on the need for civility, a healthy democracy, and people of faith having a place at the table, the debate got underway.
The following is a brief synopsis of each candidate’s answers on the five major topics covered in the debate. You can watch the full debate here.
Poverty in Canada
In response, Genius said the Conservatives plan is to lower taxes for the poor, review mortgage stress test and bring in 30-year mortgage for first time home buyers.
NDP candidate Green suggested the solution is a national housing strategy, the production of 500,000 new housing units over 10 years and $5,000 rent subsidy per year to help with the cost of rent.
On the other hand, the Green Party candidate said the party hopes to ensure that safe, secure, affordable housing needs to be a human right, combined with a universal basic income, this plan hopes to reduce poverty nationally.
The newcomer PPC candidate Haskell reiterated that provincial and municipal governments control supply, but a federal government could help by lowering immigration to decrease demand.
Sorbara defended the Liberal record, claiming 900,000 Canadians have been lifted out of poverty over the last four years, in addition to a national housing strategy put in place.
Religious freedom
On religious freedom, Haskell (PPC) talked about a British report on global Christian persecution showing that Christians are the most persecuted group around the world. He claimed that his party will prioritize Christian’s rights abroad and at home. Haskell also called out politically correct culture for silencing a defence of the Christian faith, citing the example of Elizabeth May being rebutted for saying Jesus was her “hero.”
According to Genuis (CPC), the party would bring back the Office of Religious Freedom, fight against the Liberal Summer Jobs values test, and defend persecuted minorities around the globe.
Turcotte (Green) said his party will protect religious liberty by giving people their basic needs so they can live their lives freely.
Incumbent Sorbara (Liberal) touted his relationship with refugees in his riding, his record in representing them, called the Office of Religious Freedom “ineffective,” also adding that Scheer’s cuts to foreign aid are a “shame.”
Green (NDP) called out Bill 21 in Quebec and said an NDP government will stand “loud and proud” with those fighting against it.
Life issues
The NDP said it will protect conscionce rights on euthanasia, push palliative care. They also said Catholics care about more than just abortion and questioned why the Liberals broke their electoral reform promise.
The Liberals affirmed their support of a women’s right to choose, noted that nobody is opening this debate and focused on providing subsidies to help women even further.
Additionally, the People’s Party of Canada’s representative claimed full party support for free speech, including speech about abortion. He noted that one of their candidates is planning to bring forward a private members bill banning third-trimester abortions.
The Green Party’s debate participant called for the need to look at root causes, focussed on the need for universal pharmacare to help women and look out for “health and safety of these children.”
“Pope Francis could not run for the NDP or LPC,” said the Conservative Candidate because of their ban on pro-life candidates. He called them out for “drumming pro-lifers out of public life.” He also stated that pro-lifers are welcome to run for office in the CPC. He also stressed conscience rights and free speech, and also committed to a free vote on abortion legislation.
Immigration & refugees
On the issue of immigration, the Conservative candidate said that immigration is best done with community partnership. They will lift caps on the system and strengthen support for private sponsorship.
According to the Green Party candidate, Canada will be getting more “climate refugees” in the near future, suggesting that we need to expand immigration.
The Liberal candidate said that they are proud to support the global refugee sponsorship program and that the party will be quadrupling private refugees by 2020.
The NDP touched on his ancestors being the first refugees to Canada (slaves fleeing the U.S. via the Underground Railroad). He said that Canada needs to be more welcoming and we need to stop harmful “right-wing rhetoric.”
The People’s Party candidate agreed on the private refugee plan by the CPC, noted the need to focus on stopping illegal immigration and getting out of the UN compact for global migration (need more freedom to make our own decisions).
Environment & Climate Change
The Conservative candidate claimed that all parties have the same targets, just disagree on tactics. Their party will institute tax credits and green tech investments. He suggested Canada still needs to build pipelines because it’s the most efficient way to transport the world’s cleanest oil and get off of Saudi supply.
The NDP claimed that we only have 11 years left until climate change is irreversible. We need a big plan to stop that — they will create 300,000 climate jobs while also keep communities together.
According to the People’s Party candidate, their top priority is clean water for indigenous ppl, as well as focusing on top issues like clean air and water. He reiterated that they were not climate deniers, but there is “room for doubt.”
The Green Party candidate suggested we need to end dependence on fossil fuels, expand east-west energy grid for EVs and be a climate leader on a world stage.
“No plan B for the earth,” said the Liberal debater. He suggested we must use innovation, a price on pollution (carbon tax), and subsidies for electronic vehicles to stop climate change. He also suggested that Canada can do this while still buying a pipeline because the environment and economy go hand in hand.
Clarification on Scheer’s abortion remarks
Following the debate, The Post Millennial was given clarification from CPC candidate Garnett Genuis on remarks Conservative leader Andrew Scheer made earlier this week on funding international abortions:

More to come in @TPostMillennial tomorrow. #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/SUn0vELEvK— Lucas Holtvluwer ?? (@luc_holtvluwer) October 4, 2019
Genuis said that while a Conservative government would have to respect any legally binding obligations, they would not be using taxpayer dollars to fund a “divisive issue” like abortion internationally and would instead focus the funding on “improving access to clean water, nutrition, and helping children in conflict zones.”
This position is consistent with the previous Conservative goverment’s approach under Stephen Harper, which excluded abortion from their maternal and child health plan. This is the same approach that Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation takes in their work to help improve maternal and child health around the world.
Speaking on the issue in 2014, Harper told reporters “What we have been trying to do since 2010 is build broad public and international consensus for saving the lives of mothers and babies. You cannot do that if you introduce that other issue. The fact of the matter is it’s not only divisive in our country and in other donor countries, it’s extremely divisive in recipient countries where it’s often illegal.”
Despite abortion’s illegal status in many African countries, the Trudeau government has continued to fund organizations like Marie Stopes International which has been found guilty of carrying out illegal abortions in countries like Zambia and Kenya.
Mr. Genuis, who questioned Foreign Affairs minister Chrsytia Freeland on this issue at a House of Commons committee last year, called the Trudeau government’s policy on this file “concerning” and said that a Conservative government would not be “initiating funding projects that would reopen divisive issues.”"

“British Columbia is the clearest example of a revenue-neutral carbon tax…” falsely claimed Wherry, who was given special access to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to write a biography of his time in office. Trudeau handlers reserve such unfettered access to a journalist they can trust to write flatteringly of Trudeau. (On the other hand, Liberals have blocked aggressive, ideologically adversarial journalists from covering Trudeau’s election campaign, even calling the police on one.)
“Before the charade was abandoned entirely, this is what ‘revenue neutral’ meant for the B.C. carbon tax: In 2016–17 the provincial government raked in $1.2 billion in the carbon tax from taxpayers. The amount is listed on page 68 in the budget document as a frame entitled: ‘Revenue Neutral Carbon Tax Plan.’ Then, the government scraped together 17 sundry tax credits and stuffed them into the carbon-tax frame, making the tax sum balance out to zero,” explained B.C. director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation Kris Sims in the Financial Post about how her provincial government used to lie about the tax being revenue-neutral before dropping all false pretense.
CBC’s floundering flagship The National co-anchor Rosemary Barton shared the article with the falsehood on Twitter.
Wherry lies in this piece about BC carbon tax being revenue neutral; surprised to see you re-tweeting it #cdnpoli  #cdnmedia #bcpoli https://t.co/SP65Z4MfIi— Norman Spector (@nspector4) October 2, 2019
Retired civil servant, former chief of staff to prime minister Brian Mulroney and journalist Norman Spector called out Wherry’s bogus assertion on Twitter. It took the public broadcaster hours to correct after publishing the piece and the initial revisions did not include a correction notice as is standard CBC practice.
“They acknowledged the story should have included an explanation as to why changes were made,” said Spector, a B.C. resident, to The Post Millennial. “They promised to add that to the story. They thanked me for pointing this out.”
Wherry typically writes columns defending Trudeau and Liberal policies that CBC then labels “analysis” instead of opinion. Fellow CBC columnists Robyn Urback and Neil Macdonald have their columns designated “opinion”, although the latter wrote his columns under analysis for years until a few years ago.
Eighteen hours after the initial piece was published, CBC finally issued a corrections notice explaining the multiple revisions to the incorrect piece.
“This story has been edited from earlier versions that incorrectly referred to the B.C. carbon tax as ‘revenue neutral’ in the present tense. In fact, while the carbon tax was initially revenue neutral—with revenues from the tax offset by corresponding cuts to other taxes—in recent years the B.C. government has chosen to use some of the revenue from the carbon tax in other ways. The story was also updated to add specific numbers for population and economic growth. Additionally, the earlier changes to this story should have been accompanied by a correction notice.”
The “revenue-neutral” claim is conveniently the same one the Trudeau Liberals are currently making.
CBC’s senior online disinformation reporter has yet to file a report on this disinformation that spread far and wide, but has previously filed to set the record straight on a “misleading Trudeau ‘joke’ video” and sound the alarm on Twitter bots.
Neither Wherry nor Barton issued corrections on Twitter of the falsehood they spread online. Barton also obfuscated information on Trudeau this week, dismissing the fact Trudeau has expressed he’s personally pro-life.

Barton and three of the other four debate moderators for next week’s English leaders’ debate have records of showing preferential bias for the Liberals. The Post Millennial reported earlier this week that CBC “At Issue” panellist and Huffington Post Parliamentary Press Gallery member Althia Raj went to dinner last Sunday with Trudeau’s best friend, a disgraced top aide and now Liberal campaign pitbull Gerald Butts.
CBC critics have pointed out how the self-described public broadcaster has been incredibly biased towards Trudeau’s Liberals this election, including harassing the individual who provided Time magazine with the yearbook of Trudeau in blackface and fact-checking Scheer relentlessly while largely letting Trudeau off the hook.
The Vancouver man who released the photo of Justin Trudeau in blackface at a party says the ""Canadian public had the right to know"" about it.

This is yet to be verified and the woman remains unidentified.
A “supporter” of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood up at a town hall tonight and stole the show with a modest proposal to solve the “climate crisis.”
The woman, so far unidentified, took the mic and told AOC her thoughts on the climate crisis, the Green New Deal, and AOC herself:
“We are not going to be here for too much longer. We only have a few months. left. I love that you support the Green New Deal, but it’s not getting rid of fossil fuels. It’s not going to solve the problem fast enough. A Swedish professor [says] we can eat dead people, but that’s not fast enough. So, I think your next campaign slogan has to be this: ‘We have to start eating babies.'”
This lady at a @AOC town hall makes some very good points. We do only have a few months left and we should definitely start eating babies. pic.twitter.com/rAUprGOB3M— Barrett Wilson (@BarrettWilson6) October 4, 2019
The woman then revealed a shirt that said: “SAVE THE PLANET, EAT THE CHILDREN.”
Se continued by praising AOC: “You are so great.  Even if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people … We need to eat the babies!”
AOC responded, “Luckily we have more than a few months.”
The woman insisted from the crowd: “No, we don’t.”
While it seems apparent that the woman was a high-level troll, AOC tweeted her response on Twitter to the incident by suggested that she believed the woman, much like the climate, was in crisis.
Hey everyone!

We had a fabulous town hall tonight & I’ll be highlighting some moments from it.

At one point I was concerned there was a woman in crisis & want to ensure we treat the situation compassionately.

“Squamish Nation filed submissions adopting those of Tsleil-Waututh Nation…(but) is not as badly out of compliance,” writes Justice David Stratas in his September 25, 2019 ruling, which notes their filings accuse him of bias and therefore ineligible for a panel that ultimately hears the appeal.
“I have not prejudged this review. I am not biased. I confirm that I have been open-minded and persuadable on all issues throughout,” Stratas responds.
“This should be apparent, in part…that, in the end, I have ordered a remedy similar to that proposed by Tsleil-Waututh Nation.”
Just three weeks earlier on September 4, Stratas gave the Tsleil-Waututh leave to appeal cabinet’s second approval of the 1160km bitumen pipeline from Edmonton to Vancouver on the following grounds: “was the consultation adequate in law to address the shortcomings in the earlier consultation process.”
That ruling also disqualified eco-activist groups and the City of Vancouver from proceeding in the consolidated TMX opposition, placing paramount importance to legal questions advanced by First Nations; whether the federal government fulfilled its consultation duties to a constitutional standard.
According to Stratas’ latest decision, the First Nations’ application strayed well beyond addressing this core matter at least seven times – including that Stratas be removed from the appeal panel altogether.
Bill Gallagher, veteran regulatory lawyer and longtime insider where resources and energy interests intersect with Indigenous rights, calls the Tseil-Waututh’s legal strategy “bizarre”.
“Who would expect a couple of First Nations to turn on the judge and the court that just gave them advance to the Federal Court of Appeal with a full panel,” Gallagher told The Post Millennial.
“The number one complaint of First Nations in this country, coast to coast, is access to justice. And here, they won access to justice, courtesy of this judge, then turn around and show a major case of legal ingratitude.”
“It’s highly dubious and quite bizarre lawyering in my view,” he added.
The Tsleil-Waututh and Squamish Nations scored their first victory against the Trans Mountain project back on August 30, 2018, when the Federal Court of Appeal quashed original National Energy Board permits.
In its unanimous decision the appeal court concluded that the federal government could not make an informed decision because the “Board’s process and findings were so flawed that the Governor in Council (cabinet) could not reasonably rely on the Board’s report.”
Within 24 hours of this decision, Kinder Morgan shareholders voted to sell Trans Mountain to the Government of Canada and Ottawa re-started consultations with affected First Nations.
Last June, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced cabinet’s second approval of the project’s twinning, which precipitated the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh Nations’ second crack at Federal Court.
Trudeau also said his government would be willing to sell the entire project to Indigenous interests, of which there are three separate consortiums vying for an ownership stake.
The Squamish Nation did not respond to TPM’s requests for comment and Ben West, spokesperson for the Tsleil-Waututh told TPM the First Nation would not speak to the matter while it is before the courts."
0,2019-10-03T09:42:10.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/ford-government-scraps-planned-cuts-to-social-assistance-programs,Ford government scraps planned cuts to social assistance programs,"Doug Ford’s PC government has cancelled their planned cuts to social assistance programming following public condemnation across Ontario.
The proposed cuts included Ontario Works, the Ontario Disability Support Program, and the Transition Child Benefit, which is designed to assist low-income families in need and was going to be discontinued on November first.
As CBC reports, “In the wake of that announcement, municipalities and social justice advocates said losing the benefit, which amounts to a maximum of $230 per child per month, would leave low-income families — in particular refugee claimants, who are not eligible for other child benefit payments — in a budget shortfall.”
“The money is designed to supplement Ontario Works (OW) and the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP).”
Christine Wood, a spokesperson for Children, Community and Social Services Minister Todd Smith, told CBC in an email that all proposed cuts will no longer take place and these programs will continue to function as they did before.
According to the Toronto Star, Toronto mayor John Tory had previously appealed “directly to Children, Community and Social Services Minister Todd Smith about the loss of the Transition Child Benefit,” and has since praised the Ford government’s decision not to make the planned cuts.
In a statement, Tory said, “I want to thank the government of Ontario for listening to the concerns raised about the cancellation of this funding and the impact it would have on families, their housing needs in particular, and the city’s emergency shelter system, which would have ended up as a destination of last resort for many families.”
“I hope that the review of this benefit now underway will both recognize the important contribution it makes to family stability and recognize that is should be funded on a permanent basis by the provincial and federal governments.”"

In 2018, Canadians lavished China with $9.2 million despite the country having a $13 trillion economy. Part of the funding was for “multilateral programs” and “bilateral assistance” for diversity and female empowerment.
Furthermore, in 2015, Canadians spent a whopping $18.6 million, followed by another $16.8 million in 2016.
Foreign Affairs refuses to reveal this year’s spending at a time when Canada is embroiled in a diplomatic and trade dispute over the extradition of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.
“The information is not available at the present time,” said a spokesperson for the department.
The refusal comes shortly after Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer announced he would cut 25% of all foreign aid and redirect it to benefit Canadians."

“Ok, let me make this clear: I am officially asking a rematch with [Justin Trudeau]. I suggest Halloween Day and you can come as Apollo Creed! This time, I will be Rocky in Rocky II.”

Back in 2012, Trudeau and Brazeau famously fought each other in the ring for a charity boxing match, in which Trudeau won handily after the ref stopped it in the third round.
In an interview right after the match, Brazeau suggested a rematch for the following year, and has asked for a rematch subsequently, but Trudeau has always declined.
Brazeau’s tongue-in-cheek tweet refers to Trudeau’s recent blackface scandal and his penchant for dress up. Last weekend the Toronto Star released a clearer video of Trudeau in blackface but then quickly removed it. The Post Millennial found a copy on Twitter shortly thereafter and reported on it, with the video receiving over 3 million views.

Brazeau and Trudeau’s fortunes went in drastically different directions after the match. Brazeau, previously a Conservative senator, was suspended from his position as a Senator following multiple charges laid against him, eventually pleading guilty to simple assault and cocaine possession. He worked at a strip club when suspended. He’s also suffered from mental health issues.
Trudeau would go on to win the Liberal leadership and become Canada’s 23rd prime minister.
In a 2017 Rolling Stone profile of Trudeau, the author describes how the boxing match was helpful for building Trudeau’s political brand and how Trudeau saw an Indigenous Brazeau as the perfect heel or “foil”.
Here is Trudeau cutting his opponent’s hair after winning the fight. pic.twitter.com/pxteje7T1m— Mark O'Henly (@SeeClickFlash) October 2, 2019
“The victory was twofold: It showed that Trudeau could back up his words, and that the stereotypically weak-kneed Liberal Party could take a punch,” wrote the Rolling Stone author.
“Five years and a few miles away, Trudeau mischievously smiles when I ask how much of the boxing match had been planned out. ‘It wasn’t random,’ Trudeau says. ‘I wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy tough-guy senator from an indigenous community. He fit the bill, and it was a very nice counterpoint.’ Trudeau says this with the calculation of a CFO in a company-budget markup session. ‘I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell,’ he says.”From the Rolling Stone profile.
The tweet mocking Trudeau came the same day the Liberal Leader had a photo-op at a boxing gym where journalists were invited to only film and take photos of him working out.

For yet another night, daily shelter occupancy in Canada’s largest city remained at roughly 95% on average, hitting 100% for women.
From the City of Toronto’s website, www.toronto.ca.
In response to the capacity problems, the Trudeau Liberals have invested $15 million in order to meet acute housing problems during the winter months, while the Ford government has put in $12 million towards women and children fleeing violence.
According to the City’s website, the current capacity is over “2,800 more beds than were available November 1, 2016, including 2,350 beds added since that time to motel programs, largely for families.”
While investments have been to increase space year over year and more investments are being made, the overall current capacity problems are worrying with winter approaching and deaths, therefore, being a possible consequence from a lack of space.
The City of Toronto’s shelter system has been overwhelmed in the past few years partially due to structural problems and partially because of the influx of refugee claimants entering Canada illegally from the U.S.-Canada border, as well as many others making refugee claims at Canadian airports. Most of the tens of thousands entering Canada illegally across the border are doing it in Quebec, however most of them then travel to Toronto.
The initial background check for those illegally entering the border can be less than two hours.
The sharp increase in refugee claimants entering the country occurred at the same time Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted to the world that those looking to find a new home were welcome in Canada.
The Trudeau government’s dropping of the Mexican visa requirement also caused a large spike in the number of citizens from that country seeking asylum in Canada,
Toronto city hall has already rented out several hotels, spent $3 million to hold a large office building on a contingency basis to convert into a shelter, erected three prefabricated giant tents (costing $2.5 million each) as additional respite facilities and indefinitely kept open rundown shelters to try and accommodate Toronto’s growing homeless population.
Some refugee claimants staying in the nicer shelter accommodations in the Toronto shelter system purposefully stay in the system for six months so they can become eligible for a housing allowance that helps pay their rent for up to four years, even after they find employment.
In 2017, almost 100 homeless individuals died in Toronto alone."

The 2019 Campus Freedom Index sheds light on the increasing efforts by Canadian universities to promote ideological advocacy under the guise of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) programs. This new research unveils a growing threat to freedom of expression on campus, and increases awareness about the federal government’s efforts to fund university initiatives that put free expression at risk.
Earlier this year, Minister for Science and Sport Kirsty Duncan announced $5.3 million in federal funding would be put towards diversity, equity, and inclusion grants for 15 Canadian postsecondary institutions, in the form of an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Institutional Capacity-Building Grant.
The federal government claims the funding is to identify and eliminate “systemic barriers that impede the career advancement, recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups”, including women, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, members of visible minority/racialized groups, and members of LGBTQ2+ communities.
The first round of funding was distributed to 15 small universities and colleges, each receiving between $200,000 and $400,000 over a two-year period. Some institutions have already declared what they’re going to spend the money on, like hiring more diversity officers or implementing unconscious bias training for their staff (even though studies show these trainings do not work). OCAD University vows to invest in more campus diversity training sessions, even though all incoming students are already required to sit through anti-oppression training at orientation, and all faculty receive mandatory anti-oppression and Indigenous Cultural Competency Training.
This is not the first university-based diversity initiative to be introduced by the federal government: in 2017, Duncan announced universities must address the underrepresentation of women, indigenous people, visible minorities, and those with disabilities among their Canada Research Chairs, declaring that if their chairholders were not diverse enough, their Canada Research Chair program would be entirely defunded.
Postsecondary diversity, equity, and inclusion programs are a big business. Consider their heavily-staffed offices, with at least 12 “diversity officers” at the University of Toronto, while the University of British Columbia’s Equity and Inclusion Office boasts a whopping 25 staff members (double the number of staff members working in the President’s Office).
Senior diversity officers consistently make six-figure salaries: the University of Guelph’s Assistant Vice-President, Diversity and Human Rights made $199,729 in 2018, and Ryerson University’s Vice-President, Equity and Community Inclusion made $300,000. What exactly they accomplish, besides implementing scientifically dubious training programs and hosting well-catered speaking events, is largely mysterious.
While universities have a duty to prevent discrimination and harassment on campus, the slogans of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion are sometimes abused, to stifle the discussion and debate of social, moral, political, religious, and philosophical ideas. For example, in March of 2017 Dr. Jordan Peterson was shouted down by a loud, unruly mob at McMaster University after the President’s Advisory Committee on Building Inclusive Community had declared that Dr. Peterson should not have been invited to speak at McMaster. The Council argued that “there is little to be gained by debating Dr. Peterson because he presents no argument founded on evidence that would actually be worthy of debate.”
Nevertheless, there is an important difference between creating a good work environment for university employees and restricting the debate of controversial ideas on campus. Problems arise when EDI policies apply (or are interpreted as applying) to all speech on campus, in the absence of a clear statement that limits their application to the workplace.  In the absence of such clarity, these policies easily become a tool to censor the expression of ideas that some find offensive.
The Campus Freedom Index reports that University-based diversity officers are known to interfere with freedom of expression on campus. The “Acting Manager, Gendered Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention” of Wilfrid Laurier University, Adria Joel, took it upon herself to initiate the disciplinary process against Lindsay Shepherd, one of the authors of this article, for daring to play a TV Ontario clip featuring Dr. Jordan Peterson while teaching a communications tutorial in 2017.
Federal funding encourages Canadian universities to embrace the EDI craze, adversely affecting the freedom to teach, to learn, and to engage in a truly free exchange of ideas. As universities expand EDI programs, we hope they do not lose sight of their core mission: the free and unfettered pursuit of truth, no matter how offensive.  "

Yet, it’s a policy that all Canadians can support because it will benefit all of us.
As I’ve said many times, the Canadian government is called “Canadian” for a reason.
It exists to serve the Canadian People, not to serve foreign, often corrupt, countries.
When we have such serious problems here at home, including a growing opioid epidemic, veterans who are homeless and struggling, and many Indigenous communities that lack access to good housing and even clean drinking water, then it’s obvious to everyone that we need to focus our resources here at home.
Personally, I would like to see all foreign aid (aside from disaster relief) eliminated and redirected towards Canadian citizens.
Still, the Conservative proposal has (along with earlier calls by the PPC to end all foreign aid) finally shifted the conversation around foreign aid, and will help wake up many Canadians to the reality that a large amount of our tax dollars are given away to foreign countries while Canadians here at home are suffering.
Everyone in our country can agree that we must always focus on fixing things here at home first.
Just imagine if you saw a family living in a house down the street, and the parents were always out and about giving away food and toys to the neighbourhood, but you then found out that their own children were starving and going without.
You would definitely think, “Hey, maybe you should take care of your own family before giving things away to others.”
As Canadians, we are all supposed to be a big national family. And when our own Canadian brothers and sisters are struggling and going without, we need to stop being obsessed with the rest of the world and start looking in our own backyard to make a real difference.
So, while the Conservative announcement on cutting foreign aid and redirecting some of that money back to Canadians doesn’t go nearly far enough, it is an important step in the right direction, and creates a clear contrast between the Liberals – who are always looking for a chance to give our money away – and the Conservatives, who are at least seeking to turn the tide and change the conversation on foreign aid.
Redirecting foreign aid money towards our own nation and our national family is something all Canadians can support."

The ballot box question is a way for commentators to explain the election in a nice little package and put a bow on top. Unfortunately, the explanatory power of the “ballot box question hypothesis” is weakening – people don’t vote on one issue, especially when there really isn’t a big issue separating the parties.
Grand decisions used to be made in Canadian politics, such as the 1988 election war over whether Canada should join NAFTA. Compared to today’s election, you’d be hard-pressed to identify a single policy in detail, let alone the policy that defined the election.
With social and digital media diffusing the debate away from channels of traditional authority, the ballot box question hypothesis could also be in for a rude awakening this election. To drive an election to a single overarching question or theme requires a source that has enough sway to define that question.
The media will have a challenge setting that narrative. Almost 50% of people under 30 don’t have cable, while over 30% between 30 – 40 have also abandoned our large television providers. Even if you have cable, the ratings for news services continue to drop. Newspapers continue to face a crisis in subscribers that resulted in a $600M government assistance program to keep them afloat.
Traditional media – broadcast especially – has been relegated to the play-by-play announcer of the cut-and-thrust of mini-scandals and gaffs that are strategically leaked by the different parties. This type of inside-baseball is exciting for people who follow politics closely, but less so for an unengaged Canadian.
Political parties have the advantage over the media in setting a ballot box question with their ability to go cross-platform and build a common narrative across all sources. The Liberal Democrats in Australia were able to snatch victory from almost certain defeat by defining the campaign around affordability and a carbon tax. This was a large gamble, though, and neither Canadian party in contention seems courageous enough to stake their political fortune on a policy dispute when they can focus on more sensational fare.
The problem for political parties in defining the issue of the day is their credibility gap – unless you’re a party faithful, you probably won’t believe much coming out of a politician’s mouth. Third parties in what can be broadly defined as ‘new’ media, can help define the issues of the day. Yet, these platforms are in their relative infancy and are used less as a means of defining the issues, and more as amplifying chambers for political messages.
This is set to change in the next decade. The new mediascape is in its relative infancy, and how it will develop and mature will define the next generation of politics. As these sources become more mature, this dynamic will more than likely change drastically in future elections. The rise of broadcast media and before that the rise of newspapers both had the same impact on the political conversation – it just took a few decades to mature before people realized the full impact. No amount of government subsidy to legacy media will stop it.
Until these historical trends are sorted out, the diffusion of sources of information has meant the ballot box question is a fractured mess that has as much explanatory power as a chimp with a dartboard.
Commentators will guess what propelled voters – but the truth may be a trade secret for the campaign teams who jealously guard their digital metrics and strategies. And their theories may be no more sound than those of you and I.
Welcome to our brave new world of uncertainty."

The announcement was made by Quebec lieutenant Alain Rayes, as Conservative leader Andrew Scheer needed time to prepare for an evening debate in Quebec.
While giving his announcement, he stood next to the St. Lawrence River near Montreal, where the city dumped “eight billion litres of sewage, just after the 2015 election, because a major pipe needed repairs,” reports Global News.
“The sanitation of waterways will be one of the priorities of our environmental plan,” Rayes said.
“It’s an urgent and enormous task and because we respect the prerogatives and responsibilities of the provinces, as outlined in our constitution, we will work with the municipalities to stop untreated water being released in our waterways.”
How this feat will be accomplished wasn’t mentioned, but every politician agrees it’s a problem that needs to be addressed. The Conservatives say that many municipalities have inadequate infrastructure and cannot properly manage their own sewers, and will likely allocate funds to address the problem.
“Environment Canada says between 2013 and 2017, more than one trillion litres of untreated wastewater are known to have leaked or been purposely dumped across Canada,” reports Global News.
Each party has announced a plan of action, with the Liberal government having set aside $2 billion for new infrastructure, and approving $1.5 billion for new projects in 2016."

Media organizations are demanding that the government immediately offer subsidies and payroll rebates to make good on the promises written in the Liberal 2019 omnibus bill.
“The government should implement the measures outlined in the 2019 budget immediately, without delay, to allow firms to be able to become a  ‘qualified Canadian journalism organization’ by the fourth quarter of  2019,” demanded publishers.
Only those organizations deemed “qualified” by the government-appointed panel will be able to benefit off the government funds.
A freedom of information request submitted in August by The Post Millennial found that the CRA had yet to designate any media company at the time as a “qualified Canadian journalism organization”.
In response to the request and journalistic inquiries, the Canada Revenue Agency has refused to provide further comment on the future of the bailout and when the funds will be released.
“The government is still analyzing the recommendations,”  said CRA spokesperson Dany Morin."

“There are sometimes advertisements and videos that appear (on social media)… to imply that we can be GI Joe on our main street,” minister  Ralph Goodale said of the Liberal platform’s vague reference to “limit the glorification of violence by changing the way firearms are advertised, marketed and sold in Canada.”
During a Q&A with reporters in Ottawa on Sunday, Goodale fielded questions about their incumbent government’s election promises, and was describing the sort of promotional material that could be targeted.
“(It) depicts a kind of behaviour that is simply inappropriate and some people would find it quite threatening … and it leads to the impression of military assault weapons is something you just do, every day,” explained Goodale.
“It’s really quite a distorted kind of advertising and it does glorify violence with a certain kind of weapon, that has only one purpose and that is to kill people, the largest number of people, as fast as you possibly can.”
Given the presence of such nefarious assault rifle adverts lurking in cyberspace, The Post Millennial searched YouTube and came up with real-life GI Joe; veteran U.S. Navy Seal Don Raso who extolls the self-defence virtues of the AR-15.
Rather than encouraging viewers to behave like GI Joe in their hometown’s public square, Ramos gives an all-American pitch for one of the most popular guns ever created.
“If the Founding Fathers had known this gun would’ve been invented. They wouldn’t have re-written the Second Amendment. They would’ve fortified it in stone,” says the former special forces soldier in the five-minute NRA News spot.
On Tuesday in Toronto, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held a second day of talks to push his nationwide “assault-style” firearm embargo and municipal handgun ban with the justification it will reduce gun crime.
Trudeau has also promised an additional $150 million to combat gang violence.
While Toronto has seen increased gun crime – 342 incidents, 505 shootings causing 29 deaths in GTA thus far in 2019 – Ontario Premier Doug Ford has rejected a citywide gun ban in favour of putting more resources into targeting gangs.
Ford has a long record supporting the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police who say firearm bans won’t stem the tide of illegal guns entering the country from the United States.
Police association president Adam Palmer, Vancouver’s police chief, told CBC back in August that Canada’s gun laws are already “very good…very strict”.
“People can’t be naive to the realities of how it works with organized crime and smuggling,” Palmer noted.
Canada’s Criminal Code currently contains no legal definition for what constitutes an “assault rifle” and the AR-15 is already a restricted weapon that must be registered and used only at an approved range.
Other weapons of the hunting variety that employ the same ammunition as an AR-15 have no registry requirement but owners must have a firearms licence and follow guidelines on transportation and storage."
0,2019-10-01T13:11:46.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/liberals-promise-to-eliminate-citizenship-fees,Liberals promise to eliminate citizenship fees,"The Liberal party announced the elimination of the processing fees that come along with citizenship for new Canadians to make it “more affordable.”
The current fee is $530 which was brought up from $100 under Harper’s Conservative government. The loss in revenue from this source will represent a cost of $400 million over four years ($100 million per year).
The Liberal Party policy reads that: “Becoming a citizen allows new immigrants to fully participate in Canadian society and the process of granting citizenship is a government service, not something that should be paid for with a user fee…To make citizenship more affordable, we will make the application process free for those who have fulfilled the requirements needed to obtain it.”
The Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR) supports the elimination of the fees stating, on their website, that, “Citizenship fees were doubled as of February 2014 (from $200 to $400). This represents a lot of money for someone on a low income, such as a young student or a single-parent family,” although it is worth noting that the CCR also opposes language requirements for french or English.
Andrew Griffith, a former senior immigration official, said that although he did not agree with the “steep” increase in costs for becoming a citizen, he also does not believe in removing the fees altogether. Griffith suggested a reduction of the expenses to $300 for citizenship processing would be a fair middle ground.
“Waiving the fees completely, at a cost of some $100 million a year, is excessive and will likely be perceived as political positioning to attract immigrant voters,” Griffith said.
In a statement made to the CBC Ahmed Hussen, the Liberal immigration minister seeking reelection this year, said, “We heard from groups across the country who have said that the prohibitive fees were stopping families from finally becoming Canadian.”
The minister also highlighted how much citizenship for an entire family can add up.
“Currently, the cost of applying for citizenship for an average family of four is almost $1,500,” Hussen said.
This new Liberal promise opens a divide over whether citizenship is a public good to be paid by Canadian taxpayers, or an individual luxury to be paid for by new Canadians themselves."
0,2019-10-01T12:53:11.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/trudeau-abandons-all-pretense-of-transparency,Trudeau abandons all pretense of transparency,"In 2015 Justin Trudeau promised to be open, accessible, and transparent. In 2019 he left his “sunny ways” behind.
A government statement from then notes, “we will shine more light on government to ensure it remains focused on the people it is meant to serve. Openness and transparency will be our constant companions, and we will work to restore Canadians’ trust in their government and in our democracy.”
In the case of journalists, well, “we have respect for journalists in this country!” Trudeau once shouted.
Today, Trudeau and his government stand in stark contrast to their earlier selves.
Now that he’s juggling the damning SNC-Lavalin scandal which has cost the Prime Minister two cabinet ministers and threatens to tear down his government post-election, a rapidly growing deficit with no end in sight, blackfaced and without the veneer of virtue, it seems the PM has reversed course.
Instead of sunny ways, Trudeau embarked on a campaign strategy based on a combination of expensive policies, as well as outright and brazen fear-mongering coupled with as little transparency as possible to both the media and voters.
For example, while the Trudeau government argues that Canada is heading towards a world-ending scenario by way of climate change, it also provides $2000 for families to go camping.
The program will add roughly $150 million to the deficit when fully implemented and send 75,000 low-income families into a provincial or national park.
Ignoring the obvious flaw that low-income families would likely just prefer that cash to help with rent, you’d imagine with a climate crisis on our hands, funds would be spent responsibly on policies that would save our lives and not frivolous vote buying.
But of course, finances with clear reasonable priorities should not be expected from the Liberals, especially when budgets are supposed to balance themselves.
If people call you out on it? The Liberal strategy is to do everything you can to hide the flaws.
For example, when it comes to the Liberal party’s $27 billion deficit filled platform, Trudeau and his team won’t be costing their promises with the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), even though other parties have done so already, and the Liberals themselves created the system to encourage responsiblity.
This is not a joke. They themselves created the system and they won’t be using it.
In their 2015 platform, the Liberals said allowing parties to provide independent costing through the PBO “would help Canadians make informed decisions” and give voters a “credible, non-partisan way to compare each party’s fiscal plans.”
While the party has refused to provide transparent financial information through the PBO, it has also refused to answer almost any detailed questions, preferring instead to either bar journalists or altogether ignore them when they demand answers.
Once again, I am not kidding.
Throughout the campaign, the Liberal party has banned journalist Andrew Lawton for his “lack of credentials,” while allowing writers for “Socialist Action” inside without any problems.
It turns out, if you aren’t a part of the media bailout, and don’t share a left-wing view similar to the Liberal government, you may have difficulty getting in.
Of course, getting in is only half the answer.
When journalists like Andrew are not being chased by Liberal staffers, and a journalist gets to ask a tough question, Trudeau literally ignores it, preferring to respond with rhetoric that in some cases makes little to no sense.

In 2019, the Liberals have changed. Gone are flowery politics and promises of transparency.
In its place, all that remains are grand promises, with no guarantee of success, made with the sole goal of buying your vote.
Ask yourself, what are promises worth if they have little chance of succeeding?
Perhaps most importantly, what kind of person makes promises they know they cannot keep?
In 2019, regardless of who wins, Canada deserves a transparent leader who can present a realistic future."

Many observers have called it inappropriate for minsters and other politicians — Sajjan wasn’t the only politician in attendance — to attend such an event when two Canadians, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, remain detained by the Chinese government.
“I don’t think our politicians should attend the PRC 70th Anniversary at this moment while PRC retains our Canadians with no reason for over 9 months,” said Mabel Tung, chair of the Vancouver Society in Support of Democratic Movement, in an email.
“Canada should, with other leaders of the world, stand up against ever-encroaching authoritarianism from the PRC,” she wrote, referring to the ongoing persecution of Uyghur Muslims in China and the mistreatment of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
Good Lord. @HarjitSajjan? I though he was better than this. The others don't surprise me at all. https://t.co/UAtdMEtRP3— Terry Glavin (@TerryGlavin) September 29, 2019
Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat posted to China, had a similar take on Sajjan’s appearance.
“It is highly inappropriate for any Canadians to participate in celebratory activities for the 70th anniversary of the PRC until such time as Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig are freed from their utterly unjustified arbitrary detention,” said Burton.
“Mr. Sajjan was wrong to attend an event held to celebrate the PRC in his capacity as a federal election candidate and Minister of the Crown at this time.”
Sajjan’s spokesperson, Todd Lane, has addressed the criticisms and said that Sajjan didn’t stay at the event long and took the opportunity to discuss the two men currently being detained,
“During the event, Mr. Sajjan delivered brief remarks where he spoke of the long-standing focus of the organization on promoting diversity and their efforts to grant Chinese-Canadians the right to vote,” Lane said. “Mr. Sajjan took the opportunity to state that the Chinese government needed to address the consular cases of the two arbitrarily detained Canadians. Mr. Sajjan believes in standing up for the rights of Canadians and has done so on numerous occasions. Shortly following the remarks, Mr. Sajjan departed. … Mr. Sajjan did not stay for dinner.”
As iPolitcs pointed out, the decision of several ministers to attend the pro-China event was contrasted by Mayor John Tory’s boycott of a Chinese-flag-raising ceremony in front of Toronto’s city hall. He cited “soured bilateral relations,” according to iPolitics as his reason for not wanting the Chinese flag to fly on China’s national day.
Other ministers and politicians have said that supporting the Chinese-Canadian community was their primary reason for attending the pro-China gala, with the Chinese National Day constituting a major cultural event across Canada."
0,2019-10-01T07:44:40.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/politicians-must-be-loyal-to-canada,Politicians must be loyal to Canada,"One thing that hasn’t been discussed nearly enough during this election season is the issue of loyalty.
Specifically, the importance of our leaders actually being loyal to our country.
And two key areas of loyalty are essential to future of our nation:
Loyalty to our Canadian energy industry, and loyalty towards Canada’s foreign policy interests, as opposed to the interests of nations like China.
It’s no secret that much of the opposition to the Canadian energy industry is being funded by billionaires in the US, who benefit from Canada’s industry being weakened.
Countries like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, and Iran also benefit from Canada’s energy industry being weakened. After all, we are a competitor, and anything that cuts production in our country and reduces our ability to get our oil to market will end up benefitting foreign nations.
When it comes to China, the Trudeau government allowed the Communist State to buy up some sensitive Canadian companies with connections to our national security and the national security of our allies.
The Liberals have also failed to retaliate against China’s repeated aggressions against us, and still refuse to ban Huawei, or pull our money from the China-controlled Asian Infrastructure Bank.
And while the Liberals have been by far the weakest towards China (both the Scheer Conservatives and Singh NDP advocate a far tougher approach), the previous Harper government made a huge mistake by signing the Canada-China Foreign Investment Protection Agreement (FIPA).
The combo of these two issues—loyalty to the energy industry and loyalty to our national interests—must be a key focus of this election campaign.
We live in a world that is increasingly dangerous and chaotic, and that means our leaders must be ruthlessly committed to advocating for our national interest and defending us from foreign threats.
If we allow Communist China to influence and mistreat our nation, our country will be far weaker. And if we allow foreign interests to turn the Canadian people against our own energy industry, our national will be much poorer, and we will even risk the break up of our country, while foreign dictatorships profit at our expense.
That cannot be allowed to happen.
Canada is in desperate need of a resurgence of patriotism and loyalty from our leaders, and each of us must demand this from anyone who seeks the tremendous honour and solemn responsibility of leading our great nation in the years and decades to come."

Currently, Canada spends roughly $6 billion each year on foreign aid, meaning the government would retain $1.5 billion.
Conservatives say those who would be cut from the list of countries Canada aids would be “middle- and upper-income countries as well as hostile regimes.”
Those who fall into this category have a Human Development Index above 0.6, including Argentina, Iran, China, and Barbados.
“According to Global Affairs, reports CBC. “Canada spent more than $6 billion on international assistance during the 2017-2018 fiscal year. The top five recipients were Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mali and Nigeria.”
According to CBC, “Speaking in Toronto, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said he would use the $1.5 billion in savings to pay for other policies in the Conservatives’ yet-to-be-released platform.”
Of the $4.5 billion remaining in foreign aid, Scheer says he would redirect $700 million towards aiding the poorest countries, and more specifically aiding the children of these countries, especially those in conflict zones. Ukraine is one such country that Scheer mentioned potentially increasing aid for."

Ottawa criminal lawyer James Bowie tweeted pictures of Whalesbone looking closed for renovations, saying, “It is across from my office, near the courthouse. It’s been closed since last week. Renovations.”
However, upon closer inspection of the sign, it says the front is undergoing renovations so customers can still be served at the back area of the restaurant.
Some online observers noted the restaurant’s outward appearance of looking shuttered would make it an ideal clandestine meeting spot in public. (Bowie promptly deleted his tweet after Kouvalis told him to look closer at the sign.)
The Post Millennial confirmed with sources that Raj and Butts were indeed at Ottawa’s Whalesbone at 7 p.m.
Raj is one of five journalists who were selected to moderate the English official leaders’ debate taking place on Monday, Oct. 7.
Butts resigned as Trudeau’s top advisor in the middle of Feb. for his role in the SNC Lavalin scandal in which he, Prime Minister Trudeau and others pressured former Attorney General Jodie Wilson-Raybould to consider a deferred prosecution—something legislatively created by Trudeau’s government after being lobbied by SNC Lavalin.
A deferred prosecution would allow for the disgraced engineering giant to not have to go to trial for allegations such as buying prostitutes for murderous dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s son and bribing the Libyan dictator’s family with millions.
It was announced in July Butts had rejoined the Liberals as an election campaign pitbull without the mainstream media really questioning the relatively quick return of a disgraced top aide.
Political observers were concerned Raj and Butts may be colluding in debate prep to give Trudeau a heads up on what the questions will be or what prickly questions to throw at Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.
Election debate collusion is not new, in the last U.S. presidential election cycle, CNN commentator Donna Brazile leaked questions to Hillary Clinton’s campaign team.
Some journalists came to Raj’s defence, saying it’s common practice for journalists to meet with sources.
Wow: reporter meets with source.

That’s what reporters *do*. https://t.co/ocYSqCpBqZ— Andrew Coyne (@acoyne) September 30, 2019
The commission responsible for selecting debate moderators came under fire when four of the five journalists they selected to moderate the debate have shown favouritism for the Liberals and Trudeau.
Debate moderator Rosemary Barton, one of four anchors on CBC’s flagging flagship news show The National, took a selfie with Trudeau shortly after he got into office—proudly posting it on Twitter—and makes partial remarks in favour of the Liberals such as how the Trudeau government’s large deficits don’t matter or that the RCMP are “just asking a few questions” about the SNC Lavalin scandal investigation. Fellow debate moderator Susan Delacourt has long been a stalwart supporter of Trudeau in her Toronto Star columns and was a Trudeau Foundation mentor in 2016, receiving a $20,000 honourarium.
Raj herself wrote an effusive biography of Trudeau—Contender: The Justin Trudeau Story—in which she repeatedly praised Butts’ intelligence. She’s also repeatedly defended Trudeau in her writing and on national television, as one of CBC’s “At Issue” panellists, for his scandals and government’s failings.
Last week Raj faced a firestorm on Twitter for greenlighting and publishing another HuffPo writer’s hit piece—on a 16-year-old allegation that Andrew Scheer tacitly supported an MP’s homophobic comments in 2003—which didn’t properly quote the response from Scheer’s spokesperson.
The debate moderators were selected by the Canadian Debate Production Partnership (CDPP), which was created by a Leaders’ Debate Commission that the Trudeau government founded in 2018.
The spokesperson for the Leaders’ Debate Commission referred The Post Millennial’s questions of debate integrity to the CDPP.
“…It’s not unusual for political journalists to meet with political sources. We remain confident in all of the debate moderators, all of whom are professional journalists who are working for their respective outlets, as well as with the CDPP production teams on the debates,” said CDPP spokesperson Leon Mar.
So far, Trudeau has skipped a Maclean’s debate and caused the Munk debate to be cancelled because he refused to attend.
Raj and the Liberal Party of Canada did not respond to requests for comment."

“They grabbed my equipment, my microphone. They threw my phone that I was filming with on the hood of the SUV, they threw me over the hood to handcuff me,” Menzies told The Post Millennial, adding that the Conservatives’ campaign bus hit him as he was trying to question Scheer.
“I was somewhat astonished. Scheer has publicly stated that he’s for freedom of speech, and for freedom of the press and what we saw today is the kind of thing you see in a banana republic dictatorship.”
A campaign insider for Conservatives told TPM that Menzies jumped in front of the moving campaign bus, while Menzies said, “there was a stop sign, he was at the mandated stop sign and I started to try and ask questions.”
“I don’t want anybody to get the idea that I jumped into a live lane of traffic,” Menzies added.
Reporters getting bounced from campaign events or prevented from covering them altogether has become an unfortunate storyline in this year’s federal election.

Last week, the Liberal Party prevented True North reporter Andrew Lawton from attending several campaign events featuring Justin Trudeau. The party has since apologized to Lawton but has not indicated whether the reporter would be “accredited” for future events.
And while police were involved twice in the Lawton affair – once in Hamilton where the reporter was pulled over for following Trudeau’s campaign bus and again in Thunder Bay where police tossed him from a Liberal event – the journalist was never handled or arrested.

Enter the Conservatives, whose participation in Menzies’ aggressive ejection, then his subsequent arrest on Monday – Conservatives also say Menzies was not “accredited” – contradicts statements Scheer made only last week about providing greater media access.
Today, @AndrewScheer answers our question on the recent banning of @AndrewLawton by @JustinTrudeau: ""I could absolutely commit to being open and transparent with journalists. I think it's a fundamental part of our democracy."" pic.twitter.com/kRLlm8XeTY— The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) September 26, 2019
Asked by TPM publisher Matthew Azrieli about police harassment of Lawton, Scheer responded that he is, “allowing for questions from all different types of outlets.”
“I have been running a very open and transparent campaign, allowing for questions from all different types of outlets. We have a very open accreditation process,” said the Conservative leader.
“So I’m actually going to commit to being open and transparent with journalists. I think it’s a fundamental part of our democracy.”
Corey Hann, director of communications for the Conservative Party, declined to elaborate on what Scheer meant by “all different types of outlets” or whether the Conservatives would decline to speak with any specific organizations or journalists.
“I feel Mr. Scheer articulated it well today. I’m going to let the leader’s statement stand,” writes Hann in a September 26 email to TPM.
And again today, the Conservatives are sticking with Scheer’s comments made to reporters in Whitby, following a question about Menzies’ ejection and the party’s blacklisting of Rebel Media.
“As I said a few years ago after some incidents with reporting from that network, I would no longer be granting interviews to the Rebel and as for today, this event was open to accredited media outlets,” Scheer responded to a Toronto Star journalist who asked about how the leader “views the organization now.”
Trudeau and the Liberals have also made no secret about blackballing The Rebel and have denied accreditation to several events both at home and abroad.
Most recently, self-styled “Rebel Commander” Ezra Levant and his reporter Keane Bexte were barred by Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland from attending a presser at the National Arts Centre to cover U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit in August.
The pair of reporters managed to access the event being accredited by Pompeo, a tactic The Rebel has used on previous occasions to do an end-run around the government.
After Menzies’ run-in with Scheer, the Conservatives and their RCMP detail, the veteran reporter and former Sun Media host believes the party is making a strategic miscalculation.
“We have almost 1.2 million YouTube subscribers and I’m going to take a wild guess that most of these are red meat conservatives – precisely the kind of audience Andrew Scheer wants to reach,” said Menzies.
“Ezra Levant has a great line; Mr. Scheer is all about catering to the mean girls in the media party – Toronto Star, Globe and Mail, the CBC – maybe with the hope, the optimism, these enemies will come to like and love him. But that will never happen.”
“Meanwhile, I would suggest that we’re pretty friendly media to the conservative cause and we’re being deemed media-non–grata. What is the reason for that? I do not have an answer.”
Menzies said RCMP turned him over to Durham Regional Police, who later released him without charges."
0,2019-09-30T14:30:30.000-04:00,https://thepostmillennial.com/trudeaus-camping-bursary-is-a-distraction-from-the-issues-at-hand,Trudeau’s camping bursary is an expensive distraction from the issues at hand,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal party made a new campaign promise today called “a camping experience for every kid in Canada” which unsurprisingly has another heavy price tag attached to it.
The plan would provide 75,000 low income families the opportunity to spend up to four days in a national or provincial park, subsidized by the federal government. This subsidy would amount to $2,000 bursaries per family which would cost Canadian taxpayers $150 million per year when fully implemented by 2023-24.
Now this may seem like an oddly high, and unnecessary, cost to have more Canadian families visit national parks for the purpose of camping, and you would not be wrong.
The Liberal party has also recently pledged an additional $250 million, over five years, to fight gun violence, which comes along side the Liberals “assault-style” rifle ban.
Even with the money already allocated to combating gun violence that would mean the Liberal camping program and gun violence prevention would both receive $150 million per year, and that’s leaving out any current spending in the area of public park camping.
From a strategic level this also does not seem like a particularly smart move. The Liberals are already dogged by the right for their high deficit spending, and the traditional left for not focusing enough on labour voters.
This, at least to me, seems like a repeat of former Prime Minister Theresa May’s campaign promise, back in the 2017 United Kingdom snap election, to bring back fox hunting.
It was a frivolous issue which distracted from the United Kingdom’s real problems surrounding Brexit and healthcare. No wonder her party was then reduced to a minority government propped up by the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party.
I think the camping bursaries are a bad idea, but even if they were not a financial stress, the optics of the promise make Justin Trudeau and his party seem profoundly out of touch.
The campaign promise does not come after four years of brilliant economic growth and efficient use of taxpayer’s money, it is just further spending to bolster the Justin Trudeau’s image as the fun Prime Minister.
Polls would not be as close as they are if Canadians were buying it."

Especially during her childhood.
Her triumph over mental and physical abuse from her step-father is an issue faced by many Indigenous women and girls on and off-reserve.
Accomplishing her 2013 goal of running for office in under 10-years is a testament to her resiliency and bravery as an Indigenous woman, and as the CPC Candidate for Churchill-Keewatinook.
According to the 2014 General Social Survey (GSS) on Victimization, 40 percent of girls self-reported being sexually or physically maltreated before the age of 15. That stands higher than non-Indigenous Canadians at 29 percent. Both figures provide insights into the horrific reality of child abuse in our communities.
Violent victimization amongst the Indigenous population (160 incidents per 1,000 people) more than doubles that of non-Indigenous people (74 incidents per 1,000 people). For Indigenous women, aged 15 and older, that number increased to 219 incidents per 1,000 population.
With self-reported victimization higher amongst Indigenous people for sexual assault (58 compared to 20 incidents per 1,000 population) and physical assault (87 compared to 47 incidents per 1,000 people) than non-Indigenous Canadians, the importance of coming forward, regardless of identity is vital in the push for justice, accountability, and a hopeful resolution to one’s healing.
In a Post Millennial Exclusive with Cyara, she mentioned how her abusive step-father “that [she] would end up being a drug addict selling [her] body to make money.”
Having fulfilled her promise to run for office in 2013, she added: “To be able to be here, and to be able to prove him wrong and to do good things for my people is so surreal.”
In light of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry by the Liberal Government, Cyara made it known of her intent to inspire other Indigenous women to seek office and break glass ceilings.
She poignantly states, “I want to show them that you can do anything, regardless of any hurdles that you may face.”
“Jump right over them and keep on going. Know you can do anything that you want to do that is going to make a positive impact [for our communities].”
When it came to the Inquiry, however, “[she] believes that the inquiry did not give us the answers that we needed.”
On reconciliation: “We have to make sure it doesn’t lose the power behind it.”
Following the release of the final MMIWG Report, 231 individual calls for justice were made following two-years of public hearings and evidence gathering.
The truths of some 2,380 Indigenous Canadians were heard.
Amongst the many thousands missing is Cyara’s relative, who she states, “has been missing for a long time.”
“I appreciate [the efforts that went into MMIWG, but] I feel that we need more answers.”
In part, addressing the economic realities that many Indigenous Canadians face is crucial to tackling the issues presented in reconciliation — many of which are intertwined.
From consulting Indigenous Canadians on resource development projects to developing such in an environmentally-conscious manner, both will go far in bridging the divide between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples.
“We need to make sure that we keep our natural resource sector alive because it’s so important to push Canada forward.”
“Moving forward, especially when we’re talking about reconciliation, we have to make sure it doesn’t lose the power behind it.”
From tackling mental health to ensuring communities have clean drinking water, Cyara promotes issues that impact demographics across Canada.
“One of the biggest issues [I’m campaigning on] is making sure that every reserve in Canada has clean water. There is no excuse for that to be happening.”
Two weeks after giving birth to her second child, both of which are under the age of four, she went to give her youngest a bath but was met with murky water. While unsuitable for bathing and consumption, this is an issue many on-reserve Indigenous-Canadians faces, even today.
Also, tackling the addiction and “suicide crisis,” was a top priority for her. “I would like to see land-based sobriety camps popping up, on and off-reserves.”
“I feel that if we get our people back on the right path, giving them the [tools] that they need, it’ll help pull them back to us.”
“Mental health does not discriminate. It impacts everybody.”
“I am not just doing this for my children. I’m doing it for children across Canada.”
At a Calgary-based rally, organized by her colleague Michelle Rempel in early-September, Cyara spoke to the struggles that came with this sacrifice, especially early on in her candidacy.
“There were days where I would be the only one door knocking,” she says. “Driving from one poll to the next, I would have to stop periodically to breastfeed my child.”
Teary-eyed, she referred to her past struggles as a driving factor for her campaign. Having made six attempts on her life at 19 years of age, she overcame adversity to become an advocate for Indigenous issues.
“I am not just doing this for my children. I’m doing it for children across Canada.”
She cites her children as her primary motivators in her riding, stating, “I haven’t seen both of my kids in a week because I needed to focus on making sure that this campaign moves forward.”
“My campaign manager has three kids as well and has her husband’s looking after them. So there’s a lot of sacrifices that come with [campaigning], but I know it’s going to pay off.”
Today, she advocates for a better relationship with the Indigenous Peoples of Canada, in hopes that her next of kin inherit a Canada that is fairer and more prosperous."

This isn’t a new plan. The Liberals announced the same plan 22 years ago too, then, they didn’t deliver on it.
Many pundits are suggesting that this election promise may be as empty as the one made 22 years ago.
Experts claim that the Liberal Pharmacare plan is neither well-funded nor well-detailed.
Jonathan Gatehouse from CBC claims, “Filling the gaps in Canada’s health care system will take billions of dollars more than the Liberals have put on the table.”
Victoria Gibson from iPolitics says, “Asked by a reporter about the discrepancy between his $6 billion commitment and the PBO’s estimate, Trudeau did not give a clear answer.”
It seems to be a recurring theme: climate change, cellphone costs, and now pharmacare.
There is no timeline, no real estimates, and no details.
The NDP’s press release responded to the development of this story with the following statement:
“Just six days after telling Canadians he would bring in pharmacare, Justin Trudeau has completely abandoned Canadians struggling with the cost of prescription drugs.”
The Liberals had tasked an advisory council to look into the costs for universal pharmacare. The results were staggering.
To implement a watered-down version, the government would have to spend $4.1 billion in 2022. The full version could inflate the price tag to $15.3 billion by 2027.
Michael Law, an associate professor of public health at the University of British Columbia, said, “what they [the Liberals] are currently proposing to spend is nowhere near what they would have to spend to set up a national pharmacare program.”"

According to the group’s website: “Socialist Action / Ligue pour l’Action socialiste is an organization of revolutionary socialists across the Canadian state, active in the labour movement, social justice, international solidarity,  feminist and environmental campaigns.”
Recently, the Liberals have blocked journalist Andrew Lawton from True North from reporting on their campaign events, despite the organization being a registered charity and Lawton having received accreditation in the past.
The Trudeau campaign even went so far as calling the police on Lawton and having him escorted out of a venue.

As pointed out by Lawton, one of the group’s main political program is to abolish capitalism and patriarchal institutions.

This is not the first time that the Liberals have sought to limit media access to events.
In one case the Liberals sought to prohibit both Andrew Lawton and Rebel Media’s Sheila Gunn Reid from a press conference with Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland at a media freedom summit in the U.K. However, other members of the media refused to attend if the two were not allowed entry, which they eventually were."

According to the Huffington Post, a reporter asked Guilbeault about climate change and possible increases to carbon pricing at a press conference on Friday, with a $20 per tonne tax already being set to increase to $50 per tonne by 2022.
“We’ll have to see,” Steven Guilbeault told the reporter.
“There are many measures… people seem to think that carbon tax will fix everything. It’s one of many tools that can be used in the fight against climate change.”

While not directly answering the question, Guilbeault says that after this initial 150% increase in carbon pricing, he will be able to give more specific details regarding the Liberal Party’s continued fight to make Canada greener.
“And, in 2022… well, we get an election in 2023 to talk about the next steps of our plan,” Guilbeault said.

Guilbeault also says that meeting their goals are completely achievable and that the Liberal Party has drafted and begun executing some 50 different measures to tackle climate change, with carbon pricing being just one."
