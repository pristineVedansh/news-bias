""I'm totally involved and we are going to be doing something things that are good,"" said President Donald Trump. 
President Trump sent White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to Capitol Hill hoping to strike a deal with Democrats. 
""We're not close yet, but it was a productive discussion,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
Schumer says money for state and local needs as well paying for schools to open safety is a must. 
""What started as probably the first day of a good foundation, production discussions, and building upon those until we reach an agreement,"" said Meadows.
The agreement hinges on unemployment benefits. Democrats want the original $600 a week extended until January 2021. Republicans want to reduce the amount to $200 a week.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) argues 30 million Americans count on that support for food, housing, and childcare. 
""What we are doing is not only trying to arrest the virus but to invest in the economy,"" said Pelosi. 
But the White House argues the higher amount hurts the economy because some people make more money by remaining unemployed. 
""There's no question in certain cases where we're paying people more to stay home then to work that's created issues in the entire economy,"" said Mnuchin. 
Congress is now getting ready for an August recess which puts more pressure on lawmakers to hash out a deal.

The idea was quickly shot down by Democrat and Republican lawmakers alike. Trump eventually addressed the issue on Thursday night during a press conference.
""Do I want to see a day change? No, but I don't want to see a crooked election,"" Trump said. ""This election will be the most rigged election in the history if that happens.""

'Absolute Catastrophe': New York's Mail-In Mess and What It Could Mean for the Presidential Election
Trump Proposes Election 'Delay': Here's What the 20th Amendment to the US Constitution Says
Trump points to concerns over voter fraud and the massive problems with a Presidential election depending so heavily on mail-in voting. 
 
""Well, what I want to explain to people, but it doesn't need much explanation, I mean you look at article after article. New York's mail vote disaster. Tens of thousands of mail ballots have been tossed out of this year's primaries. What will happen in November?"" Trump asked.
New York tried to let residents vote by mail in the June primaries, and that led to massive delays, the system was overwhelmed with votes and many races still haven't been counted weeks later. 
New York warns the situation could get even worse in November. 
MORE 'Absolute Catastrophe': New York's Mail-In Mess and What It Could Mean for the Presidential Election
 
""A switch from almost no absentee ballots to approximately 50 percent absentee ballots in with two months notice rally strains the system,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. 
The President referred to multiple news stories about the concerns with mail-in voting. California also experienced major problems where more than 100,000 mail-in votes were rejected in the Presidential primaries in March.

The Heritage Foundations's Hans Von Spakovsky explained on CBN's Faith Nation that one problem with mail-in voting is the rejection rate is much higher than polling places. 
 
""What election officials need to be doing is trying to ensure that as many polling places are open to vote in person, but using all the same safety protocols we're using when we go to the grocery store or our pharmacies,"" Von Spakovsky said. ""Look, the CDC just released guidelines on how to safely do in-person voting with all those kind of safety protocols in place.""
President Trump doesn't have the power to change the date of the election anyway, that's up to Congress, and they certainly don't plan to do so. But the concerns over a heavy dependence on mail-in voting aren't new. 
 
Meanwhile, a Wall Street Journal editorial warned in May that a close presidential election could lead to an election nightmare – with a close race where many votes aren't counted or thrown out, and lawsuits are filed. That could lead to an election that could further divide an already polarized country."

Alyssa Farah, the White House Director of Strategic Communications spoke with CBN's David Brody Thursday at The White House about the use of hydroxychloroquine, which has been at the center of much coronavirus controversy. 
""I would start by saying the president is the 'Right-to-Try President',"" Farah tells CBN News. ""He passed historic legislation that helps terminally ill patients try medications that are still in the trial phase, anything to try to save their lives. So that's the mindset he approaches this virus with as well. We've always said while talking about hydroxychloroquine, you should only take it in consultation with your medical professional, so with a doctor."" 
 
In the wide-ranging interview, Farah also discussed the possibility of mail-in ballot fraud in 2020, plus the president's plan to protect those in the suburbs from anarchists and violence. Below are some other highlights from the interview. You can see more tonight on CBN's nightly Faith Nation show at 6pm ET. 
 
On COVID-19 and Hydroxychloroquine
David Brody: ""If you hear the media talk about COVID-19, they like to say that this President has, 'blood on his hands.' What is the reaction when this administration hears that type of talk from the media?""  
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Well, first off, it's a tragedy that our nation is united in that we've lost 150,000 Americans. This weighs heavier on no one's heart than the President's. I'm in with him in meetings daily, when he's getting updates. He's getting data reports. He's deploying PPE, he's sending support to states. He doesn't let the noise bother him. It's hard for those who care about him and those around him. He's focused on leading though, and what our government has been able to do to respond to this unprecedented crisis is truly amazing. One thing I would tell your viewers that I think is important to know is just how far we've come since March and April at the height of this virus. Yes, cases are still rising but we have therapeutics, we have PPE, we have hospital capacity. We've actually got some exciting announcements coming on further therapeutics soon, and we're racing toward a vaccine. And that is all thank you to President Trump's leadership.""  
 
David Brody: ""So you think that media narrative is pretty much bogus?""  
  
Alyssa Farah: ""It is. Listen the media plays an important role in public health and in getting information to the American people. What's not helpful is when they're weighing in and not giving all the facts, not properly contextualizing it, and really politicizing what is a tragedy. We all really need to be united and together."" 
  
David Brody: ""Hydroxychloroquine There are a lot of folks who say the President was right all along. What's the feeling inside the White House about hydroxychloroquine?"" 
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Well, I would start by saying the president is the ""Right-to-Try President."" He passed historic legislation that helps terminally ill patients try medications that are still in the trial phase, anything to try to save their lives. So that's the mindset he approaches this virus with as well. We've always said while talking about hydroxychloroquine, you should only take it in consultation with your medical professional so with a doctor. "" 
  
On 2020 and Election Fraud 
 
David Brody: ""There was a tweet from the president this morning on Thursday morning, where he talked about, and he put a lot of question marks after, but should the election be delayed? We've already heard Senator Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz come out and say no, we're not going to delay the election. What was the thinking behind that tweet?""   
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Yes. So the President was raising awareness about the issues with mass mail-in voting. So he's been raising alarms about this for a while. When you have states send out mass ballots to voters to turn in at any time, so they're ripe for fraud. So an example we would point to is a New York congressional district had their election weeks ago. But the results have yet to be called three weeks later, because of mass mail-in voting, some fraud-related too, and not just not being able to account for the ballots. So the point he's making is, if we go to this model, and we do this across the board, how can we even be sure that the election results are going to come on Election Day?"" 
  
On the Recent Economic Numbers 
  
David Brody: ""The economy. Some tough numbers today (Thursday) in that second quarter. What does that portend for the future potentially because last time I checked, the third quarter comes after the second quarter. And oh, by the way, that could be right around October."" 
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Yes. So we were anticipating poor numbers for Q2, just to be honest. If you think about it, in April and May the economy was artificially shut down to deal with coronavirus. So millions of businesses weren't operating. Money wasn't being circulating in the economy. We started some phases of reopening in June. So actually our projections showed it would be worse than 32% that it ended up being, but we do think GDP growth is a bit of a lagging indicator. We expect that Q3 is going to be significantly better.""  
  
On Law and Order 
 
David Brody: ""He says he is the president of law and order. And of course, what we've seen in Portland, for 63 straight nights been hard to watch. What's the view of this White House when you see Democrats like Jerry Nadler and others at the (Attorney General) Barr hearing the other day and others who were saying they're calling these folks protesters, sometimes peaceful protesters, and we're seeing that the images are the exact opposite?"" 
  
Alyssa Farah: ""Oh, it's the exact opposite. And we've been getting footage. The Department of Homeland Security has been doing an incredible job trying to maintain the peace in the streets of Portland. And frankly, the governor and local police enforcement have not stepped up to the job. And what you see is organized agitators, you see anarchists trying to burn down a federal courthouse. Men and women across this country aren't going to stand for that. We've heard tremendous feedback on this issue. It's one that just really resonates with the American people because if we're not going to defend our federal buildings, what's next? Is it my neighborhood next?""

John Lewis,"An emotional homegoing service was held Thursday in Atlanta for US Rep. John R. Lewis, capping six days of celebration of the life and legacy of the civil rights legend.
The elaborate procession involved a horse-drawn carriage, parades, and a military escort along the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, along with lying in state at the nation's Capitol before being taken to his final resting spot in his adopted home state of Georgia.
At Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. served as a pastor before he was assassinated, family, friends, and co-laborers in the Civil Rights movement filled the pews.
Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock called it, ""The spiritual home of John Robert Lewis - America's freedom church.""
   
It was a final farewell to the man dubbed the conscience of Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-CA) said, ""To John Miles, to the entire Lewis family. Thank you for sharing John Lewis with us.""
Lewis was an ordained Baptist minister who practiced preaching to chickens as a young boy. Today he was honored by civil rights leaders, public officials, and three former presidents as a peaceful soldier of ""redemptive suffering"" who stood up to injustice.
    
President Bill Clinton said, ""I'm so grateful he stayed true to form. He's gone up yonder and left us with marching orders.""
    
President George W. Bush also joined in, saying, ""We live in a better and nobler country today because of John Lewis and his abiding faith in the power of God.""
    
And President Barack Obama spoke as well, saying, ""When we do form a more perfect union — whether it's years from now, or decades, or even if it takes another two centuries — John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.""
    
Lewis' friend, William Craig Campbell, a former Atlanta Mayor, summed up his life in this way: ""John Lewis was love. Good night, sweet prince.""
Lewis died July 17 at the age of 80.

Speaking in Texas on the campaign trail Wednesday, the president said the policies of the ""radical Left"" would mean the death of American prosperity and devastate America's energy industry. He points out that oil-rich Venezuela was once prosperous and successful, but now it's an economic wreck, and that could also happen to the US if we take the same path.
The president singled out Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's nearly $100 trillion Green New Deal and argued that Joe Biden's plan to mandate ""zero-carbon emissions from power plants by 2035"" will hurt America.
Earlier this month Biden announced his plan to spend $2 trillion over four years to create green energy, saying, ""God willing I win and even if I serve eight years, I want to make sure we put down such a marker that it's impossible for the next president to turn it around."" 
Trump contends that would be disastrous. ""The US energy industry would grind to a halt, and every single energy-producing state would be plunged into a depression,"" he said. ""Two million jobs would vanish overnight in just the state of Texas alone.  And I think the number is probably a lot higher than 2 million. Millions more would disappear in New Mexico and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania.""
""The policies required to implement this extreme agenda would mean the death of American prosperity and the end of the American middle class. It would mean, I think, even worse than that. It would destroy our country. I used to say, 'Would become another Venezuela.' Same ideology. You would become another Venezuela. Venezuela used to be one of the richest in the world, per capita, and period, one of the richest in the world — among the largest oil reserves. Now they don't have water, they don't have medicine, they don't have food. You got a lot of oil; it doesn't matter. Doesn't seem to matter. They don't have anything. And that can happen to us.""
Trump Points to the Riots in Portland
Trump also points to the riots in Portland as just one example of why the threat of the far-Left should be taken seriously. He says if the problem there isn't solved locally very soon, he'll send in the National Guard.
""All you have to do is look at Portland. Look at the agitators.  Look at the anarchists in Portland. And our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse. And I told my people, a little while ago: If they don't solve that problem locally, very soon, we're going to send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly,"" he said.
Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has announced the Trump administration will withdraw federal officers who've been protecting the federal courthouse in Portland under nightly attack by radical protestors.
Local officials claim their presence is making the situation worse. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said local and state officers will now protect the courthouse.
However, Trump is sending a different message, saying the agents won't leave Portland until the city is secure. The president is accusing Democratic leaders in several cities and states of not standing up to violent protestors.

“I’m bracing for the cruelty online about how he deserved to get COVID and die because of his politics,” wrote Ellen Carmichael. “We’re living in a dark time. But, they didn’t know him. I did.”
Carmichael took on the task of serving as Cain’s communications director at the age of 23, when she was right out of college. She described her time working with the accomplished businessman-turned-politician as “a chaotic experience,” recalling her time “explaining away gaffe after gaffe from an unpolished candidate.”
While the work “was really hard and exhausting,” it was absolutely worth it, because Cain “was a giant of a person in ways that people who would choose to see him merely as a caricature could never understand.”
You're never ready for the kind of news we are grappling with this morning. But we have no choice but to seek and find God's strength and comfort to deal... #HermanCain https://t.co/BtOgoLVqKz
— Herman Cain (@THEHermanCain) July 30, 2020
Before running for the Republican nomination for president in 2012, Cain, born and raised in Atlanta, served as a systems analyst for the Department of the Navy — a position he earned after earning a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Morehouse College in 1967 and a master’s degree in computer science from Purdue University in 1971.
He later became a business analyst for the Coca-Cola Company, where he remained until 1977, when he was hired to manage an analysis group at the Pillsbury Company. He later left that position to lead a Philadelphia unit of Pillsbury’s Burger King franchises, which he saved due to a number of customer service and employee morale initiatives he incorporated.
Cain is perhaps best known, though, for taking Godfather’s Pizza, a struggling Pillsbury holding, and turning it around in just 14 months.
“This man knew business and he knew people,” wrote Carmichael. “His signature approach was to go to the people closest to the problem to solve it. It worked.”
In addition to his success in business and politics, Cain fought — and “miraculously” won — his battle against stage-four liver and colon cancer.
ANYTHING ELSE?
Carmichael also shared an anecdote from her time on the campaign trail with Cain. The recollection revealed quite a bit about the late politician’s character.
The now-32-year-old Carmichael wrote about remarks Cain made “about wanting to stop the construction of a mosque in Tennessee” — a position with which Carmichael disagreed.
“He understandably got a lot of blowback on this,” she wrote. “But, members of a northern Virginia mosque opened their doors to him. They educated him. They broke bread with him. They had him speak to summer campers. He called me from the airport, voice cracking from holding back tears.”
“He told me how wrong he had been, how wonderful of a time he had and how they invited him to speak at a future Friday service,” Carmichael added. “His life was clearly changed by the experience. I hung up the phone and cried myself.”
Despite the various opinions people have about Cain’s politics, Carmichael wrote that her former boss “was a really good person … and despite the challenges he faced in his life, he deeply loved his country with his whole heart.”
In conclusion, the former communications director thanked Cain for hiring her. “Rest in peace, Herman,” she wrote. “May you have your eternal reward.”
At the age of 23, I served as the communications director for Herman Cain’s presidential campaign. It was a chaotic experience, which explains how someone fresh out of college could find herself explaining away gaffe after gaffe from an unpolished candidate.

Finally, I wish I could tell him this:
Thank you. You changed my life forever when you took a chance on me - a 23-year-old recent college graduate who foolishly thought she could be a presidential campaign spokeswoman.
Rest in peace Herman. May you have your eternal reward.

He tweeted, ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???""

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 30, 2020
Trump's tweet comes on the heels of widespread vote-counting problems after New York's mail-in-voting election which was caused by the pandemic.
New York Democrat candidate Suraj Patel, who is running against US Rep. Carolyn Maloney, is suing over the mail-in voting problems, pointing out that 30 percent of mail-in ballots received in his Brooklyn congressional district were discarded.
President Trump's Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany blasted New York's vote counting as an ""absolute catastrophe"" and a reason to question voting by mail.
  
The US presidential election is always slated for the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. That's mandated by federal law so it would require an act of Congress to change, and with Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, that seems unlikely. 
Inauguration Day Is January 20, No Matter What
One way or another, the presidential inauguration for the next US president will take place on Jan. 20, 2021 as mandated by the 20th Amendment to the United States Constitution.
The 20th Amendment states:
Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.
Due to the pandemic, there's been a push by some states to mail ballots or absentee request forms to all registered voters. Previously, voters needed to request an absentee ballot, verifying their ID in order to vote.
Mail-in voting raising concerns for many observers. Lisa Dixon, executive director of the Lawyers Democracy Fund, says, ""Election experts on both the Right and Left agree that voting by mail is the system, the method of voting that's most susceptible to fraud.""
US Attorney General William Barr told a House committee this week he believes there is “a high risk” that mail-in voting would lead to “massive” fraud. “If you have wholesale mail-in voting, it substantially increases the risk of fraud,” he said.
President Trump has called remote voting the “biggest risk” to his reelection. He told supporters in Arizona last month, “This will be, in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country.""

The Republican was slated to travel with the president on Air Force One for a campaign fundraising event at an oil rig in Midland, according to Fox News.
In a video posted to his Twitter account Wednesday afternoon, Gohmert disclosed he has tested positive for COVID-19 but said he has, so far, been “asymptomatic.”

On Tuesday, Gohmert attended an hours-long hearing on Capitol Hill, where Attorney General William Barr testified. Kerri Kupec, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, said Barr will be tested Wednesday for COVID-19 because of his proximity to the Texas lawmaker.
Gohmert, who has done much — but not all — of his business in Washington, D.C., without a mask, was very close to Barr at one point.
ACTUALLY... here is a video of AG Barr and Gohmert.

As for why he hasn’t been wearing a facial covering, Gohmert told CNN in June he was being tested regularly for COVID-19. Trump, for his part, has used the same reasoning to defend his decision to not wear a mask, though he has been seen wearing one during recent appearances.
The president encouraged Americans to wear masks earlier this month, calling the practice “patriotic.”"

Soros's contributions include several hundred thousand to the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, the Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund, and the Biden Victory Fund.
One GOP worker told the Free Beacon, ""George Soros's unprecedented spending further highlights just how dependent Democrats are on contributions from billionaires, despite their hypocritical rhetoric.""
Soros, 89, said he views the 2020 elections as pivotal, saying the ""fate of the world"" is at risk.
Soros heavily supports the ""vote-by-mail"" system which has gained momentum due to COVID shutdowns, and includes ""drop boxes inaccessible locations for voters to drop off ballots directly.""
In a vote-by-mail system, voters receive a mail ballot, which is filled out and mailed back to the local registrar of voters.
Critics say the mail-in system benefits the Democratic Party, and Republicans worry about the possibility of voter fraud since mail-in voting is difficult to verify.
The latest attempts at mail-in voting in New York have caused severe delays and confusion in the vote-counting, overloading the election system.

""According to statistics compiled by The Washington Post, the number of unarmed black men killed so far this year by police is 8...the number of unarmed white men killed by police is 11,"" Attorney General Bill Barr said.  
""The leading cause of death for black males is homicide. Every year approximately 7,500 black Americans are victims in homicide. The vast majority, around 90 percent, are killed by gunfire, and each of those lives matter.""
Democrats accused Barr of doing the president's bidding by helping Trump's friends avoid punishment - claims the AG rebuffed.
""I agree the president's friends don't deserve special breaks but they also don't deserve to be treated more harshly than other people,"" Barr said. ""I'm supposedly punishing the president's enemies and helping his friends. What enemies have I indicted?""
Republican Minority Leader Jim Jordan referred to the Russia collusion investigation, saying Tuesday's hearing was all about one word.
""Spying, that one word, that's why they're after you Attorney General,"" Jordan said. ""You said you think spying on a political campaign is a big deal. And since that day when you had the courage to state the truth,  they've been attacking you for simply telling the truth: that the Obama/ Biden administration spied on the Trump campaign.""
Barr did not read aloud part of his prepared remarks that referred to what he thinks of the Russia investigation, but they were released in advance to the press.  Here's what he wrote:
""Ever since I made it clear that I was going to do everything I could to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus Russiagate scandal, many of the Democrats on this committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the president's factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions.""
The Mueller report and voter fraud were also brought up in the hearing.  In fact, one Republican lawmaker said Barr was blamed for so much, he's surprised Democrats didn't try to pin the COVID-19 pandemic on him.

(AP) — New York’s quest to keep voters safe from COVID-19 by letting them vote by mail in the June primary has led to big delays in tabulating results, concerns about disenfranchisement — and questions about whether there will be an even bigger mess in the fall.
Election officials say it will take them until early August to finish counting a tidal wave of absentee ballots that overwhelmed a system which typically handles only around 5% of the vote. About 1.8 million New Yorkers requested mail-in ballots for New York’s primary.
Voting ended June 23, but the results of many races, including two closely watched congressional primaries, are still unknown.
A bigger problem than the delays, though, is that thousands of votes cast in good faith are getting invalidated during the counting process, candidates and good-government activists say.
Some ballots are being knocked out because voters forgot to sign and date them; others because envelopes lacked postmarks that would indicate whether the ballot was dropped in the mail in time to beat the voting deadline.
President Donald Trump’s press secretary, Kayleigh Mcenany, in a press conference this week lambasted New York’s vote counting as an “absolute catastrophe” and a reason to question voting by mail.
Candidates and voting rights groups, including the Brennan Center for Justice, are pushing state lawmakers to fix procedural problems now so the issues don’t repeat themselves in the general election in November, when even more people may try voting by mail.
New York City elections officials have refused to release statistics on the number of invalidated votes. But Suraj Patel, a Democrat locked in a close primary race with U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, said 30% of mail-in ballots received in the Brooklyn part of the congressional district were being rejected.
“This election and New York’s response, including the Senate and the Assembly, is providing Donald Trump with a blueprint to game the November elections unless they act,” Patel said.
The plan to let voters cast ballots by mail was hatched hastily and announced in April as the coronavirus outbreak was killing hundreds of people a day in New York City and its suburbs.
In the midst of the crisis, the state never provided extra funds to prepare election workers who would be handling mailed ballots or to hire extra staff to count them.
Many voters who applied for absentee ballots didn’t get them until the last minute, leaving them wondering whether they should vote in person or try the mail and potentially miss a deadline to have the envelope postmarked by June 23.

Compounding that problem, the state’s attempt to make things easier for voters by giving them postage-paid return envelopes backfired: The U.S. Postal Service doesn’t usually put postmarks on that kind of metered mail, and while its policy is to add the postmark to mailed ballots, it admits it failed to do so on some envelopes.
Candidates and activists are now claiming in a lawsuit that thousands of properly cast ballots mailed in on time were invalidated because they lacked postmarks.
The state Board of Elections said it’s too early to know how many ballots didn’t make it out to people in time or were discarded because the Postal Service failed to postmark them.
“It’s very unfortunate that the Postal Service was unable to fully carry out what they have acknowledged was their responsibility in postmarking the mail,” said state board of elections spokesman John Conklin.
A spokesperson for the Postal Service said it is addressing the issue.
Five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, and Utah — have conducted all elections by mail for years with relatively streamlined systems, while 21 other states allow localities to opt into mail-in elections, according to National Conferences of State Legislatures.
Common Cause New York Executive Director Susan Lerner called it “unacceptable and unfortunate” that so many absentee ballots are being disqualified.
“Right now an absentee ballot can be discarded if a cautious voter puts tape on their envelope to make sure the ballot doesn’t fall out,” she said.
Her group wants lawmakers to allow voters to request absentee ballots earlier and allow election workers to start counting absentee ballots sooner after Election Day.
Lawmakers could revamp a system widely viewed as outdated. By Thursday evening, the state Senate passed bills to accept absentee ballots received by June 24, ensure voters fearful of catching COVID-19 at polls can vote by mail in November, and give absentee voters a chance to fix deficient ballots.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has voiced support for lawmakers tweaking the state law that lays out the time period when absentee ballots can be accepted.
But it’s unclear whether New York will allow election workers to count all ballots lacking a postmark, including those received days after Election Day. Patel, Maloney, and other candidates have called for Cuomo to update his executive order to protect June 23 primary voters from disenfranchisement.
And lawmakers plan to hold a hearing in August on how election workers have handled the spike in absentee ballots.
“We’re studying the issue from a system-wide point of view. And any changes we can make, we will,” Cuomo said.

0,2020-07-27T13:30:00-04:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2020/july/body-of-civil-rights-icon-john-lewis-arrives-in-dc-to-lie-in-state-at-capitol,Body of John Lewis Arrives in DC to Lie in State at Capitol," WASHINGTON (AP) - The body of the late Rep. John Lewis has arrived in Washington to lie in state as lawmakers gather to pay tribute to the long-time Georgia lawmaker and icon of the civil rights movement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a delegation Monday to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to greet Lewis’s flag-draped casket. A motorcade carrying the body stopped at Black Lives Matter Plaza as it winds through Washington on its way to the U.S. Capitol, where he will be the first black lawmaker to lie in state in the Rotunda. 
Pelosi and others will attend a private ceremony in the Rotunda before Lewis’s body is moved to the steps on the Capitol's east side for a public viewing, an unusual sequence required because the COVID-19 pandemic has closed the Capitol to the public. Inside the Rotunda and outdoors, signs welcomed visitors with a reminder that masks would be required. 
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who served in Congress alongside Lewis, is expected to visit the Capitol to pay his respects. The pair became friends over their two decades on Capitol Hill together and Biden’s two terms as vice president to Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president who awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.
Notably absent from the ceremonies was President Donald Trump, who publicly jousted with Lewis. Lewis once called Trump an an illegitimate president and chided him for stoking racial discord. Trump countered by blasting Lewis’s Atlanta congressional district as “crime-infested.” 
Just ahead of the ceremonies Monday, the House passed a bill to establish a new federal commission to study conditions that affect Black men and boys.
Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Reps. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Karen Bass of California, were seen sporting “Good Trouble” face masks, a nod to one of Lewis’s favorite pieces of advice.
“Do not get lost in a sea of despair. Be hopeful, be optimistic,” Lewis tweeted in 2018. “Our struggle is not the struggle of a day, a week, a month, or a year, it is the struggle of a lifetime. Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble.”
The tributes Monday were the latest in a series of public remembrances for the 80-year-old Alabama native who helped lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the peak of the civil rights era. 
The son of sharecroppers, Lewis was among the original Freedom Riders, a group of young activists who boarded commercial passenger buses and traveled through the segregated Jim Crow South. They were assaulted and battered at many stops along the way, by both citizens and authorities. Lewis was the youngest and last-living of the featured speakers for the March on Washington in 1963, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
In Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965, Lewis suffered a beating at the hands of an Alabama state trooper that became one of the defining moments of his life. He was at head of hundreds of civil rights protesters who attempted to march from the Black Belt city to the Alabama Capitol to demand access to the voting booth. 
The marchers completed the journey weeks later under the protection of federal authorities, but then-Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, an outspoken segregationist at the time, refused to meet the marchers when they arrived at the Capitol. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on Aug. 6 of that year. 
Lewis spoke of those critical months for the rest of his life as he championed voting rights as a foundation of democracy, and he returned to Selma many times for commemorations at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where baton-wielding officers had brutalized Lewis and the marchers.
“The vote is precious. It is almost sacred,” he said again and again. “It is the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democracy.”
Lewis crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the last time Sunday on a horse-drawn carriage before an automobile hearse transported him to the Alabama Capitol, where he lay in repose, becoming one of the few citizens who wasn’t a former governor to have such an honor. He was escorted by Alabama state troopers, this time with Black officers in their ranks, and his casket stood down the hall from the office where Wallace had peered out of his window at the voting rights marchers he refused to meet. 
Lewis already has had a public funeral in his hometown of Troy, Alabama. He will have a private funeral Thursday at Atlanta’s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, which King once led.

Each day roughly 20 military veterans take their life – a staggering number that's remained consistent for years. The Trump administration hopes a new pro-active approach will help prevent suicide. 
In 2019, the president signed an Executive Order offering a roadmap of sorts to help stop the heartbreak.  Second Lady Karen Pence serves as the lead ambassador for the effort, known as ""PREVENTS"", which stands for the ""President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide"".

""I saw my role as a way to say, let's end the stigma, and let's start the conversation,"" the Second Lady tells CBN News. ""Everybody has risk factors for suicide, every single one of us.""
The numbers are hard to fathom: each year, there are more than 47,000 suicides across America, more than 6,000 of them are veterans. That translates to a rate that is double that of the general population. 
""There's help for our veterans, there's help for Americans,"" Karen Pence says. ""We actually have things we're putting into place. We want people to talk to each other and part of talking to each other and reaching out is sharing your faith.""

This weekend, the administration is looking to the faith community because believers are of vital importance. 
""The research supports that there is a connection between people having an involvement in their faith community and having less opportunity or less desire to commit suicide,"" the Second Lady says. 
In that spirit, an effort called ""REACH,"" is going out this weekend for houses of worship to directly address suicide. The administration hopes it will be the subject of sermons, feature information about prevention in bulletins, and encourage those in attendance to take a written pledge, committing to change the national conversation around mental health and suicide. 
""One of the main points involved in the REACH campaign is letting people know their risk factors and one of the risk factors right now is isolation,"" says Karen Pence. 
Indeed, with COVID-19, the fear of the unknown can be unsettling for all of us –  something the Second Lady can fully understand. ""All of us are dealing with some kind of anxiety or pressure or fear, and so what better time to say it's okay to say you're not okay."" 
Since COVID-19 began, Karen Pence's team has pushed a mental health checklist that includes asking yourself how you're doing, talking to family members, reaching out to the suicide prevention line if you need help, and trying and give yourself a joyful break. 
""What are some things that make you feel happier or kind of calm you down?"" she says. ""Schedule those into your day, whether it's reading, gardening or cooking, or praying or painting.""
The Second Lady, who is a devout Christian, tells CBN News her ultimate hope comes from above. ""Hope really is the key and for me, as you know, I'm a Christian. That's where I get my hope."" 
That comes into play all the time but especially when hard times inevitably come your way. ""I do think that when we're all low, sometimes the only person who's there for me is the Lord,"" the Second Lady tells CBN News. ""So when you actually can introduce someone to that aspect and to say, you know what, there is hope, there is hope and there is a way past this struggle that you're in right now.""

Trump had already moved the convention from North Carolina and dramatically scaled back its programming and attendance in Jacksonville in an effort to keep it on track. But the nights of ’infomercial” programming and parties appeared to be both a health and political risk to Trump and his advisers, who feared that going forward with the event, set to draw more than 10,000 people, would ultimately backfire on the president.
“It’s a different world, and it will be for a little while,” Trump said, explaining his decision during one of his newly resuscitated White House briefings on the coronavirus. “To have a big convention is not the right time.”
A small subset of GOP delegates will still formally renominate Trump on Aug. 24 in Charlotte, the original host city before Trump moved the ceremonial portions of the GOP convention to Florida last month amid a dispute with North Carolina’s Democratic leaders over holding an event indoors with maskless supporters. That event is scheduled to last just four hours in the morning.

Trump’s plans for the Florida convention were scaled back almost as quickly as the move was announced, as virus cases spiked in Florida and much of the country over the last month.
Trump said he would deliver an acceptance speech in an alternate form, potentially online.
Trump said thousands of his supporters and delegates wanted to attend the events in Florida, but “I just felt it was wrong” to gather them in a virus hot spot. Some of them would have faced quarantine requirements when they returned to their home states from the convention.
“We didn’t want to take any chances,” he added. “We have to be vigilant. We have to be careful, and we have to set an example.”
Democrats will hold an almost entirely virtual convention Aug. 17-20 in Milwaukee using live broadcasts and online streaming, according to party officials. Joe Biden plans to accept the presidential nomination in person, but it remains to be seen whether there will be a significant in-person audience.
The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to messages Thursday seeking comment on Trump’s announcement.
In recent weeks, Trump aides and allies have encouraged the president to consider calling off the convention, advising him it was not worth going forward with the event if the focus would be on the pandemic. Trump acknowledged that consideration, saying, “I could see the media saying, ‘Oh, this is very unsafe.’”
After a three-month hiatus, Trump has stepped back to the forefront of the government’s handling of the virus with regular briefings aiming to stanch an erosion of support in public and private polls that has followed the surge in new virus cases.
Trump said he did not cancel the event at the request of local officials, but the Jacksonville City Council was set to meet Friday to discuss safety concerns around the convention.
Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry, who is a former chair of the Florida Republican Party, said he appreciated Trump “putting health and public safety first.”
“I know this was a difficult decision and just demonstrates and reaffirms once again his commitment to Jacksonville, the state of Florida and the people of the United States of America,” he said. “I’m grateful for him and his leadership, and this was the right way to move forward.”
Joe Gruters, current chair of the Florida Republican Party and a state senator from Sarasota, called it a “selfless move that he canceled.”
“Having our home-state candidate was going to be a really big deal for Florida, but listen, he had it right,” Gruters said. “At the end of the day, it’s about safety.”
More than 10,000 people were expected in Jacksonville — already a fraction of the number that would attend a normal convention. Only 336 delegates will be allowed to participate in Charlotte under extraordinary procedures approved last month by the Republican National Committee. The balance of the more than 2,500 delegates will vote by proxy.

Traditional areas of civic agreement are vanishing. We can't agree on what makes America special. We can't even agree that America is special. We're coming to the point that we can't even agree what the word America itself means.
Political commentator Ben Shapiro points out that ""disintegrationists"" say we're stronger together, but their assault on America's history, philosophy, and culture will only tear us apart.

Who are the disintegrationists? From Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States to the New York Times' ""1619 Project,"" many modern analyses view American history through the lens of competing oppressions, a racist and corrupt experiment from the very beginning. They see American philosophy as a lie – beautiful words pasted over a thoroughly rotted system. They see America's culture of rights as a façade that merely reinforces traditional hierarchies of power, instead of being the only culture that guarantees freedom for individuals.
To see Pat Robertson's full interview with Ben Shapiro about the book, How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps, click on the player above.
In an interview on Thursday's 700 Club, author Ben Shapiro explained the origins of the ""1619 Project."" 
""1619 is the date slaves arrived on American shores. And according to the New York Times and Nikole Hannah Jones, the de facto editor over there now, 1619 is the true founding of the United States. America is really not about the liberty of 1776, it's not about the history of Jamestown, it's not about Plymouth Rock,"" Shapiro said. ""America is really about slavery. All of the institutions of the United States are built on the bedrock of bigotry and racism and cruelty toward others and therefore the entire system must be torn down,"" he went on.
Disintegrationist attacks on the values that built our nation are insidious because they replace each foundational belief, from the rights to free speech and self-defense to the importance of marriage and faith communities, with nothing more than increased reliance on the government. 
Shapiro says the basic idea being touted is that the only good people who've ever lived are living right now. ""It's a very anti-Judeo Christian world view,"" he said. ""That human sin is only a product of the systems that human beings live in. That if you're Jewish or if you're Christian or if you believe the Judeo-Christian world view – if you're religious of any sort, actually – you tend to believe that human beings are endemically sinful, that human beings have the capacity for sin, and the fact that human beings have done bad things over the course of history is not always the result of a system,"" he said.
But that's not the way the disintegrationist Left sees the world. This twisted disintegrationist vision replaces the traditional ""unionist"" understanding that all Americans are united in a shared striving toward the perfection of universal ideals.
How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps shows that to be a cohesive nation we have to uphold foundational truths about ourselves, our history, and reality itself – to be unionists instead of disintegrationists. Shapiro offers a vital warning that if we don't recover these shared truths, our future – our union.

Biden included Islam as one of the ""great confessional faiths"" and said, ""I wish we taught more in our schools about the Islamic faith. I wish we talked about all the great confessional faiths. It's one of the great confessional faiths."" 
The online summit was hosted by Emgage Action, a political action group that endorsed Biden in April, and that hopes to turn out a million Muslim voters for Biden in November. A number of Muslim American officials, including Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, and Rep. Andre Carson (D-IN) signed a letter organized by Emgage Action endorsing Biden on Monday.

""We all come from the same root here in terms of our fundamental basic beliefs,"" Biden told the Muslim summit, ""and I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity, for being engaged, for committing to action this November.""  
But not everyone agrees that Islam should be lumped into the same so-called confessional-type faiths as Christianity and Judaism. One major concern is Islam's historic effort to dominate to the exclusion of all other religions. In a piece about the push to get Muslims elected to public office, published last week by Robert Spencer, he quotes the co-founder of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Omar Ahmad, as saying: ""Islam isn't in America to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran, the Muslim book of scripture, should be the highest authority in America, and Islam the only accepted religion on Earth.""
Spencer says when confronted about these words, Ahmad vehemently denied saying them. But Spencer writes that ""the original reporter, Lisa Gardiner of the Fremont Argus, hardly a hardline 'Islamophobe' with an axe to grind, stood by her story.""  What's more, he cites CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper who once said: ""I wouldn't want to create the impression that I wouldn't like the government of the United States to be Islamic sometime in the future.""
Meanwhile, Spencer writes, according to a captured internal document, ""the Muslim Brotherhood (to which all the major Muslim groups in the US, including CAIR, are linked) is dedicated in its own words to 'eliminating and destroying Western civilization from within, and sabotaging its miserable house….so that it falls, and Allah's religion is victorious over other religions'.""
Groups like CAIR encourage Muslim input into textbook selection and the shaping of Islamic curricula for the public schools, which only adds to many people's concerns about Biden's suggestion to broaden Islamic studies in America's schools. 
The American Center for Law and Justice, a religious liberty watchdog, reports numerous cases in recent years where teaching of Islam has moved from general knowledge of the religion to indoctrination of school children. On its website the ACLJ cites some assignments that have raised concern from parents, like middle-school children in Tennessee being told to write ""Allah is the only God"" and recite the Islamic conversion creed. An assignment in a Wisconsin public school told students to ""Pretend you are Muslim."" 
In Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on state curricula standards and how some teaching about various religions was being carried out. From the AJC report: ""It is important that students understand the differences between each of these religions to help them understand the tensions that exist in the region,"" the state standards, known as the Georgia Performance Standards, say.  In Walton County, which manifested itself in a homework assignment one parent found objectionable: ""Allah is the  (fill in the blank)  worshiped by Jews & Christians,"" the document said. The child was supposed to fill in the blank with ""same God.""  Historical Christianity does not teach that the Islamic ""Allah"" is the same God as Jesus Christ. But it is an example cited on CAIR's website as a fact of Islam that should be taught to students.
The ACLJ says there are reports across the country of  ""innocent school children being taught to pray Islamic prayers, make prayer rugs, and practice other Islamic rituals.""
 
Meanwhile, the ACLJ reports, Christian students are being told not to bring Bibles to school or to pray.
The goal of the Muslim Voters Summit is to rally one million Muslims to go to the polls this November to defeat Donald Trump.  The hope is to turn out voters in areas heavily populated by Muslims, like in Michigan where Trump won by less than 11,000 votes in 2016.
""You're doing what has never been done before. You're registering and turning out more than 1 million Muslim voters this November,"" Biden said. ""It matters."" 
Biden's senior adviser for Muslim engagement, Farooq Mitha, said earning the votes of Muslim Americans is a priority for Biden, pointing to multiple campaign events aimed at winning over Muslim voters.
""Muslim communities can have an outsized impact in many states and we are working every day to earn their support,"" Mitha said.

But the Senate GOP and the White House are still negotiating about key points like more virus testing money. 
“We’ve made a lot of progress,” Trump said as the meeting got underway.
But the president acknowledged the “big flare-up” of rising caseloads and deaths in the states. “Unfortunately, this is something that’s very tough,” he said.
The GOP is expected to release a $1 trillion spending bill this week. One big issue: the $600 boost to weekly unemployment checks is set to expire this week. Democrats want to extend it, but Republicans will likely propose a cut.
The package from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had been quietly crafted behind closed doors for weeks and was expected to include $75 billion to help schools reopen reduced unemployment benefits alongside a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans, and a sweeping five-year liability shield against coronavirus lawsuits.
McConnell and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy huddled with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and acting chief of staff Mark Meadows.

Mnuchin vowed passage by month’s end, as earlier benefits expire, and said he expected the fresh $1 trillion jolt of business tax breaks and other aid would have a “big impact” on the struggling economy.
Mnuchin said he’s preparing to start talks with Democrats. He and Meadows were headed to the Hill later to brief lawmakers.
“We can’t pass the bill in the Senate without the Democrats and we’re going to talk to them as well,” McConnell agreed.
There remains a wide gulf between the GOP and Democratic packages, with Democrats passing in the House a $3 trillion package, while the Republican package came in at about $1 trillion.
“We have to end this virus,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday on MSNBC.
Pelosi’s bill, approved in May, includes $75 billion for testing and tracing to try to get a handle on the virus spread, funnels $100 billion to schools to safely reopen and calls for $1 trillion for cash-strapped states to pay essential workers and prevent layoffs. The measure would give cash stipends to Americans, and bolster rental and mortgage and other safety net protections.
The political stakes are high for both parties before the November election, and even more so for the nation, which now has registered more coronavirus infections and a higher death count of 140,500 than any other country.
President Trump wants a liability shield so businesses can't be sued if people contract the virus, and he's determined to get a payroll tax cut.
""What about the payroll tax cut? I'd like to see it. I'd have to see it, but I'd consider not signing the bill if it doesn't have a payroll tax cut,"" Trump told Fox News.  
One point of contention, congressional Republicans have already proposed billions more in spending for testing and for the CDC and National Institutes of Health. The president, reportedly, is against it.
This would be the fifth virus aid package, after the $2.2 trillion bill passed in March, the largest US intervention of its kind.

The 87-year-old Ginsburg, who spent time in the hospital this week for a possible infection, said her treatment so far has succeeded in reducing lesions on her liver and that she will continue chemotherapy sessions every two weeks.
“I have often said I would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam. I remain fully able to do that,"" Ginsburg said in a statement issued by the court.
She said her recent hospitalizations, including one in May, were unrelated to the cancer.
A medical scan in February revealed growths on her liver, she said, and she began chemotherapy in May. 
“My most recent scan on July 7 indicated significant reduction of the liver lesions and no new disease,"" she said. “I am tolerating chemotherapy well and am encouraged by the success of my current treatment.""

He's replacing campaign manager Brad Parscale who had been increasingly sidelined in recent weeks. 
The move comes after a Trump political rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma last month which only drew 6,200 people after Parscale said more than a million people requested tickets.
Parscale will be replaced by veteran Republican operative Bill Stepien who served as field director for Trump's 2016 campaign. Parscale will reportedly continue working on the campaign, focusing more on the digital targeting of voters.

The staff change is not expected to change the day to day operations of the campaign.
Meanwhile, there's another possible concern for the Trump Campaign – the pandemic is reportedly taking a toll on the president's standing with voters. 
All polls need to be taken with a grain of salt since some voters are unlikely to voice their opinions in these divisive times, but the latest poll from Quinnipiac University shows his job approval slipping to 36 percent, giving Democrat rival Joe Biden a big lead. CBN's Chief Political Analyst David Brody points out the methodology of that Quinnipiac poll is questionable since it had a +10 Democrat differential. 
On the flip side, one recent poll showed 8 out of 10 evangelical voters say they still plan to vote for Trump. White evangelical Christian voters make up some of the president's most ardent supporters. 
That Pew Research Center survey shows approval for the president slipping among white evangelicals amid the COVID-19 pandemic and protests over racial injustice. But 82 percent of them still say they're leaning toward voting for the president in the November election.

Stitt Becomes First US Governor to Test Positive for COVID-19,"Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Wednesday that he's the first governor in the United States to test positive for the coronavirus and that he is isolating at home.
Stitt, 48, said he mostly feels fine, although he started feeling ""a little achy"" on Tuesday and sought a test. He said his wife and children were also tested Tuesday and that none of them have tested positive.
Stitt has backed one of the country's most aggressive reopening plans, resisted any statewide mandate on masks, and rarely wears one himself.
""We respect people's rights ... to not wear a mask,"" Stitt said during Wednesday's news conference, which was held virtually. ""You just open up a big can of worms.
""A lot of businesses are requiring it, and that's fine. I'm just hesitant to mandate something that I think is problematic to enforce,"" he said.

Stitt attended President Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa last month, but he said he's confident he didn't contract the virus at the rally.
""As far as where he became infected, it's really unknown,"" Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said. ""It wasn't so far back as the rally,"" which took place nearly a month ago.
Frye said contact tracing has begun in Stitt's case, with a particular emphasis on determining those who may have been within 6 feet of the governor for longer than 15 minutes.
On Tuesday morning, Stitt attended a meeting of the Commissioners of the Land Office in a conference room at the state capitol that was attended by more than 20 people.
Stitt said he has reached out to all of the people he spoke with during the meeting.
Stitt's announcement came as Oklahoma reported a second consecutive day of record-high numbers of confirmed new virus cases, with 1,075, bringing the statewide total to more than 22,000. The previous daily high was 993 confirmed cases on Tuesday. Health officials also confirmed four additional COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday, bringing the statewide death toll to 432.
Frye said there is still plenty of hospital capacity. 
While Stitt has resisted calls for a statewide mask mandate, several local municipalities have enacted one, including Norman and Stillwater. Tulsa's city council is expected to consider a mask mandate on Wednesday.

Newswatch is seen weekdays on the CBN News Channel.
Former college football coach Tommy Tuberville soundly defeated former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tuesday in the widely- watched runoff race for the Republican nomination for Session's old Senate seat in Alabama.
Sessions said in his concession speech that Republicans must stand behind Tuberville in November.
""I leave the elected office with my integrity intact,"" Sessions said, initially standing alone before his grandsons joined him in front of reporters. ""I hold my head high.""
Tuberville, 65, who had been the coach at Auburn University in Alabama until 2008, won with about 60 percent of the vote. The former coach has never held public office but comes to the political arena with a well-known brand. He embraces Trump and sells himself as an outsider, a conservative culture warrior. 
Tuberville took a strong stand against his Democratic opponent Tuesday, telling his supporters that he threatens Alabama with ""New York values.""
""Democrat Doug Jones is running for re-election on the slogan ""One - what means is one liberal Alabama and all the liberal left,"" he said. 
President Trump strongly supported Tuberville over Sessions.

Donald Trump is right at the top of the list, but spiritually speaking he has someone even greater than the president to thank, namely Jesus Christ.
In January of this year, in the middle of all his legal troubles, Stone attended an outdoor prayer service in Florida led by Franklin Graham. Stone tells CBN News he was desperate, struggling and stressed out. Graham had met with him before the event and that night Stone made his move. 
""At that moment, I felt the calling,"" Stone says. ""I stood up with 500 other people. I wasn't the slightest bit embarrassed. I confess that I was a sinner. I repeated a pledge that he recited, and it was as if a cement block was lifted off my chest. I can't even explain it."" Stone says it gave him security about his future. ""I was never scared. I was never worried. I was completely confident that the Lord would guide the president to do the right thing.""
For decades, the provocateur enjoyed a reputation as the bad boy of politics. Then came convictions of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation into Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. 
""I don't regret anything that I did in 2016 because I didn't break the law,"" Stone tells CBN News. ""They wanted me to lie, to bear false witness against the president in return for some kind of leniency.""

Most political observers would expect Stone to be on the warpath against his enemies. But now, despite anger against prosecutors that he says were dishonest and politically motivated, Stone says he's on a new path. 
""Here's the big difference. In the old days, I would have wanted revenge. I would have wanted to take revenge against every one of them but now I've realized that vengeance is God's, it's not mine,"" he explained. 
Stone doesn't feel a need to go to his original playbook. ""I no longer am obsessed with the Sicilian concept of revenge, which generally speaking is a dish that tastes best when eaten cold,"" he added. 
Still, Stone couldn't resist putting what he's been through in spiritual terms. ""I really do believe that those who are trying to undo this president, those who are trying to destroy me, trying to destroy Michael Flynn, who's a very good man and great American patriot war hero, I do believe they're satanic,"" he said. 
Stone wasn't done. ""They cut corners and what's outrageous is their arrogance, their moral superiority, when in fact, they have no morals at all,"" he said. ""I don't believe that any of these people involved in my prosecution are really believers in God."" 
CBN News reached out to former members of the Office of the Special Counsel about Stone's satanic remark. A spokesman declined to comment.
Meanwhile, you can be sure that Stone won't be declining comment as he moves forward with his life. 
""I can guarantee you I don't intend to become boring,"" he says. As for regrets, he has them. ""I do regret the fact that it took this long for me to return to the church because I realized that I could have had the solitude and the solace and the strength and the fortitude to fight this much earlier. I went through a year of hell before I found the way."" Will he now find the way to do the hard task the Bible requires of praying for his enemies  ""The Lord will deal with them so it's not like they will go unpunished. That makes it easier to pray for them for when that moment comes.""
As for Stone's immediate future, he wants to help re-elect President Trump, this time from his perch on the outside. As for his purpose going forward, he's waiting on God. ""I think God put me in this position at this time for a purpose,"" Stone tells CBN News. ""So if God has a mission for me, He hasn't revealed it to me yet, but if He does, I'm ready for duty.""

Stone had been convicted and sentenced to three years and four months in prison for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstructing the House investigation.  
Friday evening, the White House issued a statement shredding Robert Mueller's Russia probe and explaining the decision to commute Stone's sentence. Stone wasn't officially pardoned, but his prison sentence has been erased:
Statement from the White House Press Secretary Regarding Executive Grant of Clemency for Roger Stone, Jr.
 
Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency commuting the unjust sentence of Roger Stone, Jr. 
 
Roger Stone is a victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency.  There was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign, or the Trump Administration, with Russia.  Such collusion was never anything other than a fantasy of partisans unable to accept the result of the 2016 election.  The collusion delusion spawned endless and farcical investigations, conducted at great taxpayer expense, looking for evidence that did not exist.  As it became clear that these witch hunts would never bear fruit, the Special Counsel's Office resorted to process-based charges leveled at high-profile people in an attempt to manufacture the false impression of criminality lurking below the surface.  These charges were the product of recklessness borne of frustration and malice. 
 
This is why the out-of-control Mueller prosecutors, desperate for splashy headlines to compensate for a failed investigation, set their sights on Mr. Stone.  Roger Stone is well known for his nearly 50 years of work as a consultant for high-profile Republican politicians, including President Ronald Reagan, Senator Bob Dole, and many others.  He is also well known for his outspoken support for President Donald J. Trump and opposition to Hillary Clinton. 
 
Mr. Stone was charged by the same prosecutors from the Mueller Investigation tasked with finding evidence of collusion with Russia.  Because no such evidence exists, however, they could not charge him for any collusion-related crime.  Instead, they charged him for his conduct during their investigation.  The simple fact is that if the Special Counsel had not been pursuing an absolutely baseless investigation, Mr. Stone would not be facing time in prison.
 
In addition to charging Mr. Stone with alleged crimes arising solely from their own improper investigation, the Mueller prosecutors also took pains to make a public and shameful spectacle of his arrest.  Mr. Stone is a 67-year-old man, with numerous medical conditions, who had never been convicted of another crime.  But rather than allow him to surrender himself, they used dozens of FBI agents with automatic weapons and tactical equipment, armored vehicles, and an amphibious unit to execute a pre-dawn raid of his home, where he was with his wife of many years.  Notably, CNN cameras were present to broadcast these events live to the world, even though they swore they were not notified—it was just a coincidence that they were there together with the FBI early in the morning. 
 
Not only was Mr. Stone charged by overzealous prosecutors pursuing a case that never should have existed, and arrested in an operation that never should have been approved, but there were also serious questions about the jury in the case.  The forewoman of his jury, for example, concealed the fact that she is a member of the so-called liberal ""resistance"" to the Trump Presidency.  In now-deleted tweets, this activist-juror vividly and openly attacked President Trump and his supporters. 
 
Mr. Stone would be put at serious medical risk in prison.  He has appealed his conviction and is seeking a new trial.  He maintains his innocence and has stated that he expects to be fully exonerated by the justice system.  Mr. Stone, like every American, deserves a fair trial and every opportunity to vindicate himself before the courts.  The President does not wish to interfere with his efforts to do so.  At this time, however, and particularly in light of the egregious facts and circumstances surrounding his unfair prosecution, arrest, and trial, the President has determined to commute his sentence.  Roger Stone has already suffered greatly.  He was treated very unfairly, as were many others in this case.  Roger Stone is now a free man!

Mallory Quigley with the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List told CBN News, ""What we have today is a bitterly disappointing decision, especially on the part of the Chief Justice for his flip-flop.""
Louisiana Right to Life Executive Director Benjamin Clapper agreed. ""We're disappointed in today's decision and we're disappointed in Justice Roberts, who chose for the abortion facilities and their interests over protecting the health and safety of women.""

'Threat to Their Orthodoxy:' Why Liberals Don't Celebrate Clarence Thomas for Black History Month
The Louisiana law is similar to a Texas law that the Court struck down four years ago. Back then, Chief Justice John Roberts was for the anti-abortion Texas law. But now he's flipped, saying the Texas decision is a controlling precedent. He wrote that the new ruling is ""...controlled by (the Court's) decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law.""  
Regent Law Professor Brad Jacob spoke of Roberts' helping to kill the Louisiana law when not all that long ago he'd backed the Texas law. 
""He said in that case, 'this is wrong – the Constitution does not require us to strike down a law requiring admitting privileges in a hospital.'  (Monday) he said, 'even though I still think that opinion is wrong, I'm going to follow it.'   And so he followed the precedent that he himself said is wrong,"" explained the incredulous Professor Jacob.
The White House weighed in against the Court's ruling, saying in a statement, ""...unelected justices have intruded on the sovereign prerogatives of state governments by imposing their own policy preference in favor of abortion to override legitimate safety regulations.""
Clarence Thomas: Abortion Precedents 'Should Be Undone'
Justice Clarence Thomas in his dissent bludgeoned his fellow justices. He said none of the Court's pro-abortion decisions are supported by the US Constitution.  He labeled them ""a creation that should be undone.""
He went right after the Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortion legal nationwide and the rulings that followed it, writing, ""Despite the readily apparent illegitimacy of Roe, the Court has doggedly adhered to (it's core holding) again and again, often to disastrous ends.""
Thomas also wrote, ""Abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled.""
Professor Jacob backed Thomas, saying of the pro-choice justices, ""Their job is to apply the words, the original meaning of the United States Constitution.  And if there's an earlier opinion that is wrong, and they knowingly follow the earlier wrong opinion – follow precedent instead of following the Constitution itself – I think they've violated their oath of office.  I think they have acted unconstitutionally.""
Meanwhile, many are asking is the Court actually all that conservative? What this decision and several others show is that the conservative majority court-watchers thought would now hold sway may not be real.  
Chief Justice Roberts was once thought to be a fairly firm conservative vote.  But he has sided repeatedly with the four more liberal justices. When he does it on an issue as precious to conservatives as abortion, it means probably every issue is up in the air.   "

The federal statute Trump cites subjects anyone who willfully injures or destroys, or attempts to injure or destroy, any structure, plaque, statue or other monument on public property commemorating the service of any person or persons in the armed forces of the United States to fines, up to 10 years imprisonment or both.
Trump's declaration comes as protesters tried to pull down a monument of Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States, in a park located near the White House before police stopped them.

Besides the Jackson statue, there was also a second incident of vandalism involving St. John's Church. Vandalism has also occurred at the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Memorial since the protests began late last month following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. 
Trump took to Twitter Monday night, calling the efforts to topple the monument ""disgraceful vandalism"" of a ""magnificent statue."" 
I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran's Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent.....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 23, 2020

Jackson, a former US Army general who served two terms in the White House from 1829 to 1837, has long been criticized by Native American activists for his role in forcing indigenous tribes off their ancestral lands. Many of them died in what several tribes refer to as ""The Trail of Tears"" when some of them were relocated to the Indian Territory. 
At first, only memorials to Confederate soldiers and officers were targeted, but the demonstrators have moved on to attack other historical figures, including the pulling down of a statue of George Washington, the nation's first president, in Portland, OR, and a monument to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in San Francisco, CA. Grant was the Union general who defeated Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, which led to the end of the American Civil War and also served as the nation's 18th president.

On Friday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court rejected a legal bid to stop the rally over health concerns
""We are all on board going to Oklahoma,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. ""We are taking appropriate measures like hand sanitizers and temperature checks and masking provided at the door.""
One million tickets were requested and 100,000 expected to attend. Supporters traveled from as far as California and have already lined up outside. 
""I really thought this was an important rally for me to go to,"" Blake Markell said. ""It's the 9th one I've been to, but after being away from rallies so long.""

The Oklahoma National Guard was even called in to help with security.
Trump tweeted ""any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!"" 
""The mayor noted that individuals from groups that have been involved in violent and destructive behavior in other states are planning to travel to Tulsa for the purpose of causing unrest in and around the rally and that's an unacceptable proposition,"" McEnany said. ""We will not see anything like we saw in Minnesota where an Auto Zone was lit on fire.""

The panel continues its probe into how multiple mistakes were made leading up to the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Tense questions greeted the headline witness former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.  He tried to explain that while he was accountable for mistakes in the infamous Operation Crossfire Hurricane, he should not be blamed for them. CBN News spoke to one expert who begs to differ.
""Every application that I approved appeared to be justified based on the facts it alleged.  And the FBI was supposed to be following protocols to ensure that every fact was verified,"" Rosenstein explained.  
Rosenstein took a lot of heat from members of the committee.  That’s because he approved so-called FISA warrant applications that ultimately led to the investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election and any link to the Trump campaign.  An inspector general's report found several application violations, including some with misinformation sent to judges who would approve those applications.
""This investigation, Crossfire Hurricane, was one of the most corrupt biased criminal investigations in the history of the FBI and we’d like to see something done about it,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said. 
""Who should we hold responsible, what do you want this committee to do? The other side wants us to do nothing they don’t want to talk about it they’re happy for these abuses to go on apparently.  What do you suggest that we do?,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO).
""I think Senator there are issues of accountability and blame. I’m accountable. m here being chastised by you as part of my accountability, but the question is blame. What went wrong, Rosenstein answered.

Adding fuel to the fire, this recently released FBI document started the whole investigation.  Notice that it’s from controversial FBI agent Peter Strzok to Peter Strzok, and approved by Peter Strzok.  Experts say it was poorly constructed and did not make a case.
However, Democrats contend that the IG’s report indicated Operation Crossfire Hurricane was justified despite the errors and led to findings of Russian meddling. 
""Congress should not conduct politically motivated investigations designed to attack or help any presidential candidate, Mr. Chairman, Period,"" said Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA). This would be true at any time but even more so now that we’re facing the killing of George Floyd and we’re in the middle of a pandemic.
""We’re sitting here showing the American public that we argue with each other very well while Rome is burning,"" said Sen. Corey Booker (D-NJ). 
Former Assistant Federal Prosecutor John O’Connor told CBN’s Gary Lane, America can’t let this ride.
""There was FISA abuse in the fact that we know the court was lied to multiple times in multiple ways.  And everyone that had any idea in the falsity and that is the concealment in the presentation should be prosecuted,"" O’Connor said. ""We have a whole battery of wrongdoing here and it is sickening. It’s more and more of a rats nest every time we get a new disclosure.""
Committee Chairman Graham says here’s the reason to continue probing.
""If you knew then what you know now would you sign the warrant application?"" he asked.  
""No I would not, Rosenstein replied. 
Senator Graham wants to subpoena more than 50 other potential witnesses. Democrats call that overkill and they will call witnesses of their own. Of course, this is all in addition to the ongoing criminal investigation into the origins of Crossfire Hurricane being done by US Attorney John Durham.

President Trump is expected to sign the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act into law this week - legislation that passed Congress overwhelmingly.
""This is the first time a legislative body around the world in Uyghur's human history passed a significant bill to address Uyghur's political, economic, social, and religious rights,"" says Nury Turkel, who was instrumental in getting the legislation passed and was just appointed to the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).
""With this law, the Uyghur law in place, the administration will be directed to impose the global Magnitsky sanctions that go after Chinese officials who have been responsible for persecuting religious and ethnic minorities in China,"" he explains during an interview with CBN News.
Since the spring of 2017, China has been transferring Uyghurs living in China's Xinjiang province into so-called re-education camps that international observers call modern-day concentration camps.
Uyghurs are an ethnic minority in China. Most practice Islam. In recent years, China's communist regime has turned up the heat in its war against people of faith - specifically targeting Christians and Muslims.
""They're forcing Uyghurs and others to denounce their religious practices and they've been forcing Uyghurs to go through or adopt a non-traditional, non-religious way of life which is much more common for the ruling Hun Chinese people,"" says Turkel.
The bill awaiting the president's signature also requires the administration to report on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, including formal estimates of the number of Uyghurs and others detained in concentration camps. Today Turkel estimates three million are being held against their will.
As a naturalized American citizen, he says the legislation ""shows the best of my country.""

For him, it's personal. Turkel is an Uyghur Muslim who was actually born in a prison camp and understands the devastating effects of religious persecution firsthand.
He says what's happening in China today is modern-day cultural genocide.
""When a government regime collectively punishes an ethnic group targeting their women and children mainly because of their ethnic background and religious practices meet the definition of cultural genocide.""
Over the past year, the Chinese government has ""graduated"" thousands of Uyghur detainees and assigned them to work in factories.
Reports indicate American companies operating in China such as Nike, Calvin Klein, and Apple either directly employ or source from suppliers suspected of using Uyghur detainees as forced labor.
USCIRF believes the exploitation of Uyghur and other Muslims has become so systematic that US customs officials should assume all goods produced in Xinjiang are the product of forced labor.
Several lawmakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R) and Reps. Jim McGovern (D) and Jennifer Wexton (D), have introduced legislation to address this.
""This is 2020. People should not be punished based on what they worship, what kind of lifestyle that they maintain, and what kind of people that they're married to. The Chinese government is even forcing Uyghur women to marry Hun ethnic Chinese individuals with incentives and even some instances threats,"" Turkel says.
Religious freedom advocates say the plight of Uyghur Muslims in China is something that should concern all people of faith.
""Since the crisis came to surface, we've been receiving an enormous amount of support from the Christian communities, Jewish communities; but what is lacking is the other faith groups. They also should speak out. No one should be persecuted for their religious practices. It's a God-given right. People should be able to practice and it's a matter of privacy and government should have no business in people's privacy when they're worshipping and when they're praying,"" concludes Turkel.

Faith Nation is seen weekdays on the CBN News Channel. For a programming schedule, click here. 
Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. apologized Monday for a tweet that upset African American members of the Liberty community. The tweet had been aimed at Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, but it included a racist photo from Northam's medical school yearbook page decades ago. 
""After listening to African American LU leaders and alumni over the past week and hearing their concerns, I understand that by tweeting an image to remind all of the governor's racist past I actually refreshed the trauma that image had caused and offended some by using the image to make a political point,"" he tweeted Monday.

— Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) June 8, 2020
""Based on our long relationships, they uniformly understood this was not my intent, but because it was the result,"" Falwell continued, ""I have deleted the tweet and apologize for any hurt my effort caused, especially within the African American community."" 
I have deleted the tweet and apologize for any hurt my effort caused, especially within the African American community. (Part 3/3)
— Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) June 8, 2020
A group of African-American alumni of Liberty University called ""LU Alumni for Biblical Diversity"" called out Falwell earlier this month for years of behavior they call ""infantile"" and ""incendiary"" topped off by his tweet which was seen by many as racially insensitive and not Christ-like.
The group - made up of African-American pastors, ministry leaders, and former athletes who graduated from the university - was upset about his May 27th tweet complaining about Northam's (D) mandate that citizens wear masks to combat the coronavirus.
Falwell tweeted if he's ordered to wear one he'll only comply if a ""picture of Governor Blackface himself is on it!"" referring to a picture on the governor's medical school yearbook page that shows one student in blackface embracing another wearing a KKK hood and robe. 
The shocking photo surfaced in early 2019. After first apologizing for appearing in blackface, Northam recanted saying he couldn't remember doing it and suggested the photo was printed under his name by mistake. 
I was adamantly opposed to the mandate from @GovernorVA requiring citizens to wear face masks until I decided to design my own. If I am ordered to wear a mask, I will reluctantly comply, but only if this picture of Governor Blackface himself is on it!#VEXIT#EndLockdownNow pic.twitter.com/twu7r4rWhd
— Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) May 27, 2020
Falwell's tweet garnered more than 6,000 comments including one from Dan Smith who said, ""All people of color should reconsider their enrollment at Liberty University immediately.""
All people of color should reconsider their enrollment at @LibertyU, immediately.
— Dan Smith (@dsmithjr85) May 28, 2020
Megan McNinch responded, ""As a student at Liberty University Online I find this appalling! Someone else's bad decision in the past does not condone YOUR bad decision in the present. Statements like this make me embarrassed to be a student here.""
As a student at @libertyuonline I find this appalling! Someone else's bad decision in the past does not condone YOUR bad decision in the present. Statements like this make me embarrassed to be a student here. Philippians 3:13-14, Ephesians 4:31-32, Matthew 7:1-5
— Megan McNinch (@McNinchie) May 27, 2020
""While your tweet may have been in-jest about Virginia's Governor, it made light of our nation's painful history of slavery and racism. It is what we're called to reject as followers of Christ - 'Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place...'"" wrote the group of black alumni in the petition, quoting Ephesians 5:4.
""The reckless nature of this tweet is a microcosm of the past several years of divisive rhetoric that does not display the kind of Christian witness that the Gospel demands of us, nor does it represent the Christlike Leadership that Liberty University deserves. It has brought further disgrace to Jesus Christ and Liberty University,"" the petition states, which has garnered more than 37,000 signatures.
Falwell is a staunch supporter and ally of President Trump. The group says his tweets indicate he cares more about politics than Jesus Christ.
""It has become obvious to many that your heart is in politics more than Christian academia or ministry, so we would encourage you to leave the position of school president and pursue politics full-time,"" they write.
Signers of the petition say they can no longer in good faith encourage the students who worship at their churches and in their communities to attend LU or accept athletic scholarships. The alumni also say they'll stop making financial donations to the school.
""We ask you to withdraw your racist tweet immediately and make a public apology. If you decide to stay at Liberty, this coalition stands ready to meet with you in order to provide counsel on ways for LU to best move forward in these racially-charged and divisive times.""
They say their time at the university deeply impacted them and add, ""Our ultimate goal is for Jesus to be glorified in all that we say and do. We pray that is your desire as well.""

Throughout history, we have seen both good and bad examples.  But it's important to realize who truly calls the shots.
Dr. Peter Lillback and his Philadelphia-based Providence Forum work to highlight the many times and ways God has touched America and its leaders throughout its history.
Lillback told CBN News, ""God is in charge right now with the president of the United States. But not just this one – everyone before and every one after. And God is working out His will.""
'God Establishes the Boundaries & Times of Nations'
Lillback also heads up Westminster Theological Seminary. Studying and teaching how God works in history and through leaders is one of his specialties.  
""When Paul was on the Areopagus in Acts Chapter 7, he said to the Athenians, 'God establishes the boundaries and times of nations.' And so, yes, the Bible says He raises up leaders and puts them down,"" Lillback stated with assurance.

""When political leaders are raised up, God is involved in that. Now we don't know if that is for blessing or for judgment!"" Lillback said with a laugh.  ""But, absolutely, Donald Trump is leading because of God's purpose. But that's also true of Barack Obama. It's also true of George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. And, as hard as it is to say this, even the tyrants and dictators of history; God is working through all of them.""
But what to do when one of those bad leaders comes along?
'Call Them to the Higher Law of God'
""To think that God has made a mistake or God is absent? I can't say that biblically. And when we have a president we don't like, the Bible tells us we're still to respect those in authority,"" Lillback explained. ""But also call them to the higher law of God and say, 'Are you following His standards?'
If a president will follow God's standards, Lillback insisted it'll bring godly wisdom and blessing to America.
""One of the great truths that we have is God's truth and His word is His wisdom. And it's given out of His love for His creatures,"" Lillback stated. ""A lot of people say, 'Oh the Ten Commandments: God is cruel, God is mean; He's taking away my pleasure.'  It's not at all true. This is the Creator saying, 'Do you want to know the best way to live? Follow My will.'""
Give Us Leaders Who Will Bow Before the Lord
Such a follower leads his nation to seek God's will and ways.
""We ask the question, 'What's right? What's wrong?  That is the great history of America at its best,"" the seminarian said. ""And that should be our prayer: that God would restore just governance among us by people who really bow before the Lord and say 'teach me Your wisdom'.""
God is well-pleased to guide and prosper such a people. As Lillback put it, ""God's law creates the opportunity to do all that we need to do in a way that blesses all that we touch and all the people around us.""
And Lillback said of such a people dedicated to God and His ways, ""They know to do the right thing in the right way and at the right time that brings blessings to many.""
So at such a time of global crisis as mankind now faces, rather than looking to government leaders to solve all the problems, humanity would do better looking higher to the God who puts those leaders in place.

While visiting an auto assembly plant, Biden and an auto worker got into a heated discussion over guns, The Wall Street Journal reports.
The worker told Biden he was ""actively trying to take away our Second Amendment right and take away our guns.""
""You're full of s***,"" Biden said to the worker.
 
A press wrangler attempted to intervene but was quieted by the former vice president.
""I support the Second Amendment, just like right now if you yelled 'fire', that's not free speech,"" Biden said. ""From the very beginning, I had a shotgun, I had a twenty gauge, twelve gauge. I am not taking your gun away at all. Do you need 100 rounds? No.""
The worker repeated the charge, ""You're going to take our guns,"" but Biden pushed back. ""I did not say that! I did not!""
Biden has suffered a series of recent blunders, including a failed attempt to recite the Declaration of Independence during a campaign speech in Texas. The video of that mistake has gone viral.
""We hold these truths to be self-evident,"" Biden said. ""All men and women are created, by the, you know the, you know the thing.""  
Millions of people have watched the gaffe on Twitter:

And Biden called a 21-year-old college student a ""lying dog-faced pony soldier"" during a campaign stop in New Hampshire last month.
It happened when Madison Moore asked Biden if voters should remain confident in his abilities after he suffered a weak performance in the Iowa caucuses. 
Biden asked the student if she had ever been to a caucus. When Moore said she had, that's when Biden boldly called her a liar.

Moore told the Macon Telegraph that the joke was ""kind of insulting."" 
""It was kind of humiliating to be called a liar on national TV by the former vice president,"" Moore said. ""Instead of answering that question straightforward, his immediate response was to attempt to invalidate me by exposing my inexperience.""
To be fair, candidates across the spectrum have had plenty of verbal gaffes during election seasons, and President Trump has come under fire for comments he's made in recent years as well.
Despite Biden's blunders, he leads Bernie Sanders in the Democratic delegate race with 823 to Sanders' 663 and he's already talking about how he will campaign against President Trump in the general election.  "

Newcomer Michael Bloomberg took most of the hits while frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) remained relatively unscathed.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was the most aggressive in her attacks against Bloomberg.
""I'd like to talk about who we're running against – a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians,"" she said. ""And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.""
The billionaire who's spent hundreds of millions of his own dollars on campaign ads hit back and pivoted to train his focus on President Trump.
""I am a New Yorker. I know how to take on an arrogant conman like Donald Trump,"" said Bloomberg.
He apologized for the controversial policy known as ""Stop and Frisk"" which he had defended as the mayor of New York City.
""I've sat, I've apologized, I've asked for forgiveness,"" Bloomberg explained. ""There is no great answer to a lot of these problems and if we took off everybody that was wrong on this – off this panel –  everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers, there would be nobody else up here.""
He also took hits over alleged discriminatory and sexist comments made to women who worked for him.
""We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against,"" said Warren.
Sanders Also Took Some Hits for His Socialist Agenda
Sanders, who's surging in national polls, also fielded a fair amount of attacks and had to defend his socialist healthcare and economic policies.
""I believe in democratic socialism for working people, not billionaires,"" said Sanders. ""Health care for all.""
Bloomberg was quick to point to the failure of socialism throughout history, and questioned the practicality of Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" policy.
""You don't start out by saying I've got 160 million people, I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love,"" said Bloomberg.
Pete Buttigieg took his attacks to both the frontrunner and newcomer.
""Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat,"" he said. ""Look, we shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out.""
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, clashed several times with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) once for not knowing the name of Mexico's president. ""Are you trying to say that I'm dumb or are you mocking me here, Pete?"" asked Klobuchar.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who's been steadily slipping in the polls, spent the night defending his record.
""I'm the only one on the stage that actually got anything done on health care,"" said Biden.
The Nevada caucus is Saturday but early voting has already taken place. From Nevada, the candidates head to South Carolina ahead of that state's primary and another debate.
Trump Says Election Is for 'the Survival of Our Nation'
Meanwhile, President Trump was also on the campaign trail Wednesday night in neighboring Arizona, blasting the Democrats while telling the enthusiastic crowd that the Republicans stand with the American people.
""The Democrat Party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American Dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right?"" he said.
The president added that this year's election is for ""the survival of our nation"".

But Bloomberg's communications director would not confirm or deny the report.
""We are focused on the primary and the debate, not VP speculation,' Jason Schechter, the campaign's communications director, said in a statement.
Clinton won the Democratic nomination in 2016, but lost to Donald Trump in the general election.
Shortly after Drudge reported the news, Bloomberg tweeted a random message touting that he supports women in the workplace.
“I would not be where I am today without the talented women around me. I've depended on their leadership, their advice and their contributions,"" he wrote. ""As I've demonstrated throughout my career, I will always be a champion for women in the workplace.""

Polls show the top two candidates from the Iowa caucus are also leading there: Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. But the WBZ/Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll now shows Sanders breaking away with 27 percent and Buttigieg with 19 percent.
Sanders, who dominated the state in the 2016 Democratic primary, thinks he can do it again. ""If we win here in New Hampshire, and with your help I think we can win, it'll make it easier for us to win in Nevada, and South Carolina, and in California.""
 
Both men are working to fight off their opponents who are ramping up the attacks after the two emerged as front-runners in the botched Iowa caucuses.
One of those opponents appears to be making headway, according to that poll.
Reports indicate Sen. Amy Klobuchar may be picking up steam in the Granite State, with large crowds coming out to her events the last few days, according to Buzzfeed News.
""Every step of the way, we have defied expectations. We have met every merit,"" she told supporters.
Now the Suffolk University poll shows her in third place with 14 percent, surpassing former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Klobuchar may be gaining traction after what many considered a strong debate performance Friday night.
Biden and Warren each weighed in with 12 percent support.
Biden is pressing his case, arguing he's the best choice to beat Trump. ""I think I'm more ready to be able to defeat Donald Trump and equally importantly, elect a Democratic Senate.""
Meanwhile, Buttigieg is pushing back against claims he's trying to brand himself as the next Obama, even though he clearly campaigned in Iowa by praising voters there for picking a new guy with a ""funny name"".
""Twelve years ago Iowa changed America's understanding of what it looked like to have a viable presidential candidate who was viewed as improbable from the outset,"" Buttigieg told Iowa voters. ""A young man with a funny name from over the border in Illinois, and you put him on the path to the presidency.""
Meanwhile, New Hampshire will have another political visitor Monday night as President Trump holds a rally in Manchester, the state's largest city.

""This is what the end result is,"" Trump said while holding up Thursday's copy of the Washington Post with a headline that reads ""Trump Acquitted.""
The gesture was met with roaring applause by members of his family, White House staff, and members of Congress all packed into the East Room of the White House.
The president says it hasn't been easy. He even apologized to his family for having to endure what he calls a rotten ordeal.
However, now Democrats are planning their next moves.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler says lawmakers will likely subpoena John Bolton to learn what he was prepared to tell the Senate, and other high ranking Democrats say the Ukraine story isn't over.
 
It's a risky strategy for Democrats though. Continuing to go after the president just months before the election they run the risk of looking like sore losers. They may also possibly put at peril vulnerable Democrats up for re-election.
Meanwhile, some Republicans are going on offense.
Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson are looking into possible conflicts of interest by Hunter Biden and his Ukraine dealings.
The Treasury Department has complied with their request for information about his government sponsored travel and protective detail he received while his dad was vice president.
While the headlines focused on the president's impeachment statements Thursday, he also used the stage at the National Prayer Breakfast to tout his work to protect religious liberty.
""In America, we don't punish prayer.  We don't tear down crosses.  We don't ban symbols of faith.  We don't muzzle preachers. We don't muzzle pastors,"" he said repeating a line from his State of the Union address Tuesday.
It was a ""proof of performance"" speech that demonstrates why he enjoys high approval among evangelicals.
""To protect faith communities I have taken historic action to defend religious liberty, including the constitutional right to pray in public schools,"" he said to applause.
From criminal justice reform to executive action on the Johnson Amendment – a rule that blocks pastors from talking about politics – the president listed the promises he's made good on.
""I also recently took executive action to stop taxpayer dollars from going to colleges and universities that spread the poison of anti-Semitism and bad things about Christianity,"" he said.
And he reminded the crowd of Christian and other religious leaders no president has done more to protect the unborn.
""And we're pursuing medical breakthroughs to save pre-mature babies because every child is a sacred gift from God,"" the president said to applause.

McCain specifically asked Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, about a recent radio interview during which he asserted that life begins “with breath,” arguing an unborn child is not actually human until he or she breathes air outside the womb for the first time.
FAITHWIRE  ‘The Answer Is…Unknowable’: Pete Buttigieg Is Lying to Himself or to You About Abortion
“There’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath,” Buttigieg said at the time. “And so even that is something that we can interpret differently.”

“In my circles,” McCain explained, “it was passed around because I think the interpretation from pro-life people like me was that you meant a baby actually being born and there’s a lot of controversy with … what it means and what time a woman should be able to have an abortion. I wanted you to clarify because I found that statement to be pretty radical.”
Buttigieg really sidestepped McCain’s question by instead telling her that people “interpret their own moral lights, and for that matter, interpret Scripture differently.”
FAITHWIRE  LGBTQ Activists Angry to Learn Pete Buttigieg Rang the Salvation Army Bell
Unsatisfied with his avoidant answer, the ABC co-host asked Buttigieg if he supports partial-birth abortion, to which he said it is not “up to a government official to draw the line.”
McCain then asked the 2020 candidate if he would be OK with a woman who just delivered her baby saying she wanted to “invoke infanticide” — something Buttigieg asserted doesn’t happen (though, it should be noted, that’s exactly what Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, endorsed last year).
Buttigieg then created a scenario that pro-lifers say is fairly unlikely:
Think about the situation. If this is a late-term situation, then by definition, it’s one where a woman was expecting to carry the pregnancy to term. Then she gets the most, perhaps, devastating news of her life. We’re talking about families that may have picked out a name, maybe assembling a crib, and they learn something excruciating, and are faced with this terrible choice. And I don’t know what to tell them, morally, about what they should do. I just know that I trust — and her decision, medically or morally, isn’t going to be any better because the government is commanding her to do it.
Frustrated by the dialogue, McCain assured Buttigieg, an Episcopal Christian, that she believes his position on abortion is ""radical"".
“Quite frankly,” she added, “that answer was just as radical as I thought it was. Sorry.”"

The president held a ""celebration"" Thursday afternoon at the White House, speaking out against the impeachment investigations against him and in a remarkable moment apologized to his family. 
""I want to apologize to my family for having them having to go through a very rotten deal by some evil and sick people and that includes Baron, Ivanka. Honey – come,"" as Trump motioned to First lady Melania Trump to come up to the podium for a hug.

The Top 5 Most Beautifully Stunning Moments at the State of the Union
Just a few hours after appearing at the National Prayer Breakfast, and less than 24 hours after his acquittal, the President addressed the nation from the East Room of the White House. 
Trump and his supporters say his acquittal is a full vindication and exoneration. The president called the event, not a speech or news conference, but a ""celebration""
""I've done some things wrong, I will admit, but this is what the end result is,"" Trump told the assembled audience, holding up a newspaper with the headline ""Trump Acquitted"" printed in bold ink across the top.
""We can take that home honey. I'm going to frame it. It's the only good headline I've ever had in The Washington Post,"" the president said.  
He then gave a shout out to his legal team and Republican lawmakers calling them a ""great group of warriors."" 
""Mitch McConnell you did a fantastic job,"" he said. 
But one vote which denied Trump a unanimous ""not guilty"" verdict was when Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) voted to convict him on the first article of impeachment. 
""My promise before God to apply impartial justice required, I put biases aside for the sake of a partisan end expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience,"" Romney said before the Senate vote Wednesday. 
It was a historic vote that did not go unnoticed by President Trump. 
""One failed presidential candidate and I call that half a vote cause he actually voted for us on the other one, but we had one failed presidential candidate that's the only vote we lost,"" Trump said. 
And the president doubled down on his earlier swipes at the National Prayer Breakfast.
""I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away and I said some things that a lot of people wouldn't have said. But I meant every word of it, "" he added.  
Trump called the House Speaker ""a horrible person.""
""She may pray, but she prays for the opposite – but I doubt she prays at all,"" he said. 
Rep. Pelosi (D-CA) earlier said the president is forever impeached, justifying her decision to tearing up his State of the Union speech in front of a national television audience as a dignified act. 
""I tore up the misrepresentation of the truth,"" she said.  
Trump said that he'll probably have to deal with impeachment in the future and if that happens he said, ""We'll beat them again if we have to."" "

It means President Trump will remain in office.
Trump, 73, was acquitted by the GOP-held Senate of the charges of abuse of power by a vote of 52-48 and of obstruction of Congress 53-47. The charges were brought to the Senate by the Democrat-held House of Representatives less than three months ago. 
Senators sworn to do ""impartial justice"" were required to stand at their desks for the roll call and state their votes – ""guilty"" or ""not guilty.""
Earlier in the day, one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, announced on the Senate floor that he was breaking with his party and voting for impeachment. He was the only Republican to vote ""guilty"" on the charge of abuse of power. 
Ahead of voting, some of the most closely watched senators took to the Senate floor to tell their constituents, and the nation, what they had decided. The Senate chaplain has been opening the trial proceedings with daily prayers for the senators.
""This decision is not about whether you like or dislike this president,"" began GOP Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine centrist, announcing her resolve to acquit Trump on both charges.
GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said that while he doesn't condone Trump's actions, he was not prepared to remove him from the ballot nine months before the election. ""Let the people decide,"" he said.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell slammed House Democrats' drive to impeach Trump as ""the most rushed, least fair, and least thorough"" in history. 
He said the two impeachment charges against Trump – that he abused his power and obstructed Congress' ensuing investigation – are ""constitutionally incoherent"" and don't ""even approach a case for the first presidential removal in American history.″
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York accused McConnell and his GOP colleagues of sweeping Trump's misconduct under the rug. 
""The administration, its top people, and Senate Republicans are all hiding the truth,"" Schumer said, claiming that Trump tried to ""blackmail a foreign country to interfere in our elections."" House Democrats prosecuting the case argued that Trump abused his power when he pressured Ukraine to investigate whether Democratic rival Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to drop a corruption investigation that could have involved his son Hunter.
Although the trial is over, investigations will continue with talk already of the House Democrats planning to subpoena former National Security Adviser John Bolton.
Republicans Say Impeachment Effort Will Hurt Democrats in the Election
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warns this impeachment process sets a dangerous precedent for future presidents.
""It's never enough when it comes to President Trump – this sham process is the low point. If you think you've done the country a service by legitimizing this impeachment process, what you've done is unleashed the forces of hell – this is sour grapes,"" Graham said.
Donald Trump, Jr, tells CBN News he thinks voters see through impeachment. ""This impeachment started the day he beat Hillary Clinton and has gone on since then. It has manifested itself a few times, first it was Russia, then it was this, yada, yada, yada. It's just gone on forever.""
Majority Leader McConnell is predicting this will play well for vulnerable GOP senators up for election in 2020.
""Every one of our people in tough races, every one of them is in better shape today than they were before the impeachment trial started,"" McConnell said.
The impeachment finale comes as President Trump has just hit his highest job approval rating in the Gallup Poll.
The latest survey has him at 49 percent approval which is the best mark for the president since he took office in January in 2017.
The poll also showed that 50 percent disapprove.
Among Republicans, the president has a 94 percent approval rating compared to just seven percent among Democrats.
 
And 63 percent approve of the way the president is handling the economy. The public is showing its highest satisfaction with the economy in nearly 15 years."

Ebbin withdrew the bill from consideration Tuesday without identifying the reason.

VA Bill Is Latest Effort by Democrats to Change Electoral College, Taking Away Voice of Rural Americans
Another measure in the Virginia House of Delegates, House Bill 177, introduced by Del. Mark Levine, D-Alexandria was defeated last Friday in committee by a 10-12 vote. Three Democrats joined Republicans to vote no.
Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, told WRIC-TV his reason for opposing the bill. ""One of the things that was in place was to try to ensure that certain large states like California and New York, now, don't have all the control in making a decision for president."" 
Levine has tried to pass similar legislation the past three consecutive sessions, The Times reported. 
""The Electoral College is an outdated institution that creates an undemocratic system for deciding who holds the most important office in the land,"" Del. Ibraheem Samirah, D-Fairfax, a co-patron of HB 177 told the newspaper. 
But supporters of the Electoral College say America's Founding Fathers had a really good reason for creating it.
How the Electoral College Works
Under the Electoral College established by the US Constitution, there are a total of 538 electors. Each state has the same number of electors as it does Members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two Senators. 
A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.
There's been an effort nationwide, led mainly by members of the Democrat Party, to bypass or abolish the original intent of the Electoral College. The effort has escalated since the 2016 election in which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote while Donald Trump won in enough states to win the Electoral College and the presidency.
The current system requires a presidential candidate to win the states, not just individual voters. That ensures less-populated states still have a voice.
So far, 15 states and the District of Columbia have passed NPVIC legislation.
Colorado was one of those states that passed the measure. Jerry Sonnenberg, a Colorado Republican state senator, told The Times he opposed the bill because he believed the change would weaken the electoral power of sparsely populated rural states like Wyoming and Utah while strengthening states like California and New York.
In his view, the Electoral College was created so that ""people in rural areas did not get overrun by the masses.""
In 2019, a Gallup poll found more Americans prefer naming winners of national elections based on a popular vote. ""They favor an amendment to the Constitution to make that happen, but are more reluctant to have states make changes to how they award their electoral votes,"" Gallup said in a summary of its finding.
A constitutional amendment, however, is required to switch from the Electoral College to a popular vote with two-thirds of the states being needed to vote to approve such a change. "

Gretchen Whitmer used the Democratic Party's response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address to quickly swivel her party's main focus from impeachment to working-class voters' worries, saying her party is set on easing health care costs and other pocketbook concerns.
In her 11-minute address, Whitmer only mentioned Trump's impeachment trial near the end of her speech Tuesday night. 
She also threw in a few references to his tweets saying, ""Bullying people on Twitter doesn't fix bridges — it burns them.""
Most of her address, however, was spent on her party's efforts on health care and some people's struggles to pay their bills. These are the issues that Democrats focused on in the 2018 election and helped win her party control of the House.
Democrats won House control in 2018 by lambasting efforts by Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law. Democrats say they will concentrate on health care in this year's campaign as well, including opposing an administration-backed federal lawsuit aimed at declaring Obama's statute unconstitutional.
""It's pretty simple. Democrats are trying to make your health care better. Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away,"" Whitmer surmised. 
Whitmer tried to show how Democrats across the country are taking action to help increase school funding and minimum wage hikes.
She also summed up some of the more controversial topics her party has been promoting to voters for the last several years in just a few sentences -- alluding to gun control, unions, college payment, environmental controls, the LGBT agenda, abortion, and more.
""Democrats want safe schools. We want everyone to have a path to a good life, whether it's through a union apprenticeship, a community college, a four-year university -- without drowning in debt. We want your water to be clean. We want you to love who you love, and to live authentically, as your true selves. We want women to have autonomy over their own bodies. We want our country welcoming and everyone's vote counted,"" the Michigan governor said.
In Democrats' Spanish-language response, freshman Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar focused on health care and workers' struggles to get by."

The Faith and Freedom Coalition, led by prominent evangelical leader Ralph Reed will make the official announcement later today. The conservative organization plans to spend roughly $50 million during the 2020 election cycle. Specifically, FFC will target certain battleground states. Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania are all key swing states but Reed's group is going beyond those traditional bellwethers and plans to hit evangelicals with the digital campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan and Arizona.
The initial digital onslaught will come in the form of emails, text messages and other social media outlets and plans to target nearly four million faith voters in the next five days alone. 
 
The digital campaign will focus on events and actions taken by Trump carrying through on campaign promises to evangelicals including his remarks at the recent, March for Life Rally in DC, where he became the first president to ever address the crowd in person. It also includes decisions such as moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem, protecting religious freedom, withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal, defeating ISIS and the strong economy.
 
Statistics show President Trump won the White House because of strong support among conservative evangelicals. Exit polls in 2016 showed a record 81 percent of white evangelicals backed his candidacy. Polls still consistently show strong support.   "

The president's theme was ""The Great American Comeback"" touting his economic success since taking office. 
  
""The state of our union is stronger than ever before,"" Trump said.
 
Also he spoke about defending religious liberty in powerful terms stating:
 
""We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of faith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!""
 
Next, he called on Congress to fight for the unborn.

The absence of some Democrats did not go unnoticed, yet Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) said it was important for him to attend the event, even if he disagrees with President Trump.
""I disagree with the president on many things but he's still the President of the United States and I believe it is my constitutional obligation to listen to the president and try to make the best I can to find any common ground there may be.""

""Mr. President please take this message back, that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous fight for freedom. Socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom restores the soul,"" Trump said.
 
Everyone in the chamber rose to their feet again to welcome back Sgt. Townsend Williams in a realtime surprise homecoming.
Then conservatives in the room applauded as radio host Rush Limbaugh was honored on the spot with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That last-minute move came a day after Limbaugh revealed he's facing a battle with Stage 4 lung cancer.
 
""In recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all the incredible work that you have done for charity,"" Trump announced.
 
The address wrapped up with the House speaker making it clear what she thought of the president's speech, visibly tearing up the pages on camera.
Hice added, ""Unbelievable I mean while the President is saying God Bless America, Nancy Pelosi is behind him tearing the speech up. That to me exemplifies the Democratic Party we are dealing with in Washington DC.""
White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway weighed in too, accusing Pelosi of throwing a ""temper tantrum"". Conway said, ""America saw an incorrigible child ripping up the State of the Union... I think it shows you how petty and peevish and partisan the Democratic party has become.""
Meanwhile, there was at least one bright light from the Democratic side of the aisle during the president's address. Sen.

""The administration, its top people, and Senate Republicans are all hiding the truth,"" Schumer said, adding that Trump tried to ""blackmail a foreign country to interfere in our elections.""
House Democrats prosecuting the case argued that Trump abused his power when he pressured Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden.
The impeachment finale comes as President Trump has just hit his highest job approval rating in the Gallup Poll.
The latest survey has him at 49 percent approval which is the best mark for the president since he took office in January in 2017.
The poll also showed that 50 percent disapprove.
Among Republicans, the president has a 94 percent approval rating compared to just seven percent among Democrats.
 
And 63 percent approve of the way the president is handling the economy. The public is showing its highest satisfaction with the economy in nearly 15 years.

President Trump planned a number of powerful moments to punctuate his message throughout the State of the Union address Tuesday night, and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's feud with the president couldn't fully sour the evening. 
Pelosi, who led the impeachment effort against Trump, refused to introduce the president as ""a high honor and distinct privilege"" as is the custom for the Speaker of the House. And Trump appeared to decline to shake her hand when she offered it, although there's widespread debate on social media about whether he actually saw her gesture. But one stunning move was unmistakable. To cap off the evening, Pelosi tore up the pages of his speech right behind him, repeatedly shredding the pages right after he finished.

'God's Grace Is Still Shining': Extended Coverage of Trump's State of the Union
While that display of animosity was certainly stunning for its negativity, there were more than five moments that were equally uplifting, offered by the president. Here they are: 
1. Confronting Socialism
Standing in direct defiance of the socialist debacle in Venezuela, President Trump surprised most observers by introducing ""the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó"" who was sitting in the House gallery. Guaidó is the opposition leader who has been selected by Venezuelan lawmakers to become president of the country, but dictator Nicolás Maduro still clings to power through violent force.  
""Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom!"" Trump said.  ""Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.""
2. Taking a Pro-Life Stand
In a powerful pro-life moment, the president introduced a little girl who had survived even though her mom gave birth only 21 weeks into her pregnancy – a stage at which some babies are still aborted because pro-choice advocates say they're not viable. Trump said little 2-year-old Ellie Schneider, born as a micro-preemie, is proof that all life should be cherished and late-term abortion should be ended.
""Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life,"" Trump said. ""Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!""
3. Reuniting a Military Family
Trump honored military families in several ways throughout the night. He applauded Brigadier General Charles McGee, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen – the first black fighter pilots who fought against Nazi Germany in World War II.
He also honored the courage of a wife and son of a service member who was killed by a roadside bomb, explaining that it was for families like theirs that he took action to eliminate Iran's architect of terror in Iraq.

But the happiest moment came when he later introduced another military wife and her two young children, and in a sudden twist, he announced that their husband and daddy Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams had just returned from the front in Afghanistan, reuniting the family right then and there inside the Capitol.
4. Honoring an American Victim of ISIS
The president also introduced Carl and Marsha Mueller whose daughter Kayla, 26, was captured, tortured, and killed by ISIS terrorist leader Al-Baghdadi himself. Trump announced that the mission to end Al-Baghdadi's life was given a code name - ""Task Force 8-14."" It was a reference to a special day:  August 14th – Kayla's birthday. Carl Mueller held up a large photo of Kayla for the world to remember her as the entire room stood to applaud.
""America's warriors never forgot Kayla, and neither will we,"" Trump said.
5. A Last-Minute Medal of Freedom
Finally, in another touching moment, Trump introduced a last-minute guest, conservative lion Rush Limbaugh who just announced this week that he has stage 4 lung cancer. Not only did Trump honor him by inviting him to the State of the Union, but he also bestowed an impromptu Presidential Medal of Freedom on Limbaugh, and First Lady Melania Trump presented it to him right on the spot. Democrats did not stand to applaud, despite Limbaugh's dire diagnosis.

There were certainly other powerful moments from the evening, like when the president honored a little girl he had invited, announcing a scholarship for her to attend whatever school she wanted so she wouldn't be trapped in a failing government school. 
Trump maintained a tone of optimism throughout much of his address, concluding, ""Our spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; God's grace is still shining; and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come!""

With the final numbers now almost completely tallied from Monday's caucuses, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are in a virtual dead heat.
With 97 percent of the vote counted, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Buttigieg has 26.2 percent and self-proclaimed socialist Sen. Sanders has 26.1 percent.
 
Both are far ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren who finished third with 18 percent.
And former Vice President Joe Biden was fourth with just under 16 percent. On the campaign trail in New Hampshire, Biden acknowledged he did not do well.
""I am not going to sugarcoat it - we took a gut punch in Iowa,"" Biden admitted.
And he may be in trouble in New Hampshire too, with polls showing Sanders and Buttigieg in the lead there.    
Technical problems hae marred the complicated process in Iowa, forcing state officials to apologize and raising questions about Iowa's traditional place atop the presidential primary calendar.
Democrat Party officials have been confirming the votes by hand count after a reporting app failed due to a coding error.
During a private conference call with campaigns this week, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, Troy Price, declined to answer questions about the timeline. ""We have been working day and night to make sure these results are accurate,"" Price said at a subsequent news conference.
The leading candidates have been pressing on in New Hampshire, which votes this coming Tuesday.

The theme of tonight's State of the Union is ""The Great American Comeback."" President Trump is expected to tout the strong economy, jobs and trade deals. 
According to a senior administration official, the president will keep it positive, laying out a clear vision of ""relentless optimism."" 
Trump made it clear that despite what's happening on Capitol Hill with impeachment, he will not postpone the speech.
""I am going to have it, it's going to be done, we are going to talk about the achievements that we made. Nobody has made achievements like we've made, so many different things, I am so proud of what we've done for our vets with choice,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News over the weekend.
Still, the impeachment drama hangs over Trump, who is only the second president to give a State of the Union address while in the middle of an impeachment trial, and the nation remains deeply divided.
It's unclear if Trump plans to bring up impeachment as he stands before some of the very lawmakers who want to remove him from office. Republicans have urged him to avoid the subject.
""My advice would be that in the State of the Union he should move on,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN). 
""The president's got a good record when you look at the economy and lower taxes and fewer regulations and higher incomes and I think he'd be well advised to focus on that and let the impeachment trial speak for itself,"" he continued.
""He is his own person, obviously he can bring up things as he chooses to... but I'm not coming into that speech to be able to hear more about impeachment,"" said Sen. James Lankford (R-OK). 
The Senate is on track to wrap up the trial on Wednesday, an acquittal all but sealed. 
No GOP senators have indicated they would vote for Trump's removal from office, including moderate Republicans like Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski who criticized the president's behavior but said she will vote to acquit him.
""I cannot vote to convict. The Constitution provides for impeachment, but does not demand it in all instances,"" Murkowski said.
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin from West Virginia is still undecided on how he will vote, but on Tuesday he urged his colleagues to formally censure the president.
""Censure would allow this body to unite across party lines and as an equal branch of government to formally denounce the president's actions and hold him accountable. His behavior cannot go unchecked by the Senate,"" Manchin said.
 
Even so, he's one of a few Democrats who may join Republicans in voting to acquit the president.
The Senate's final vote on acquittal or conviction is set for Wednesday afternoon.

No One Knows Yet,"Caucus chaos struck in Iowa as inconsistent and inaccurate counts have delayed the results. Who's the culprit? Democratic Party leaders blame it on technology and are now counting votes by hand. Still up in the air: Who won?
As the count went deeper into the night with no results, the campaigns began to pack it up and move on. ""So listen. It is too close to call,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren told supporters.

Iowa's Democratic Party leaders say it wasn't a hack or an intrusion, but they're concerned about ""quality checks"" and ""inconsistencies,"" some blaming a new app designed to help the reporting.
Joe Biden announced, ""I want to make sure they're very careful in their deliberations. And indications are, our indications are it's going to be close.""

The disaster is further muddying up a hotly contested primary season.
Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg had all been hoping to break out the pack with a win in the Hawkeye state.
With uncertainty in the air as candidates addressed their supporters Monday night each took advantage of the situation to celebrate like they were the winner.
Pete Buttigieg claimed, ""By all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.""

Sanders supporters are hopeful this is finally his year. Jok Dut Jok of Des Moines told CBN News, ""I feel like Bernie is really going to be the answer that we need, I feel like he's the only one viable that can go against Trump right now.""
While Warren caucus-goers also had some pep in their step. ""I'm so excited! I'm so thrilled,"" Katherine Eckhouse said.
Biden didn't quite make it as a viable candidate at every precinct, but his supporters aren't giving up.
McKenna Tingle said, ""I think that overall Biden does have the support we need, some of the candidates still have confidence that he's going to do well, so I think a lot of Iowans just aren't showing up for him but I think ultimately he will do well.""
 
Still, many Democrat voters tells CBN News it's time for some new leaders.
Robert Meryl of Johnston, Iowa said, ""I feel like it's time to get some younger people with some different ideas.""
 
The majority stands ready to support whoever wins the nomination.
Elizabeth Warren supporter Veronica Tessler said, ""I will be behind whoever the candidate will be.""
But no matter whom that is, Donald Trump, Jr. tells CBN News none of the candidates are a match for his dad.
""The reality when I look at what I believe to be the two frontrunners right now, whether it's Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, well one's a communist, that's great, I can work with that – and the other, honestly, can't remember what state he's in 50% of the time,"" Donald Trump, Jr. said.
 
Since 2000, each Democratic presidential candidate who's won the Iowa caucus has gone on to win the party's nomination. Given the unusually crowded primary field, many campaigns hope 2020 marks the end of that streak.

One senior administration official says ""in his address, the president will lay out a vision of relentless optimism.""
Trump made it clear that despite what's going in the Senate, he will not postpone the speech.
""I am going to have it. It's going to be done.  We are going to talk about the achievements that we made,"" Trump said. ""Nobody has made achievements like we've made, so many different things. I am so proud of what we've done for our vets with choice."" 
It's not clear if the President plans to mention the impeachment trial or call out Democrats sitting in the audience.
This will be his first face-to-face meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) since House Democrats voted late last year to impeach him. 
Last week, the Senate voted 51-49 to reject additional witness testimony in the trial, clearing the way for lawmakers and Trump's defense team to begin their closing arguments.
""The President and his aides wielded the powers of the presidency and the full weight of the US government to increase pressure on Ukraine's government and coerce him to announce two sham investigations that would smear his potential election opponent and raise his political standing,"" said Rep. Val Demings (D-FL)
""At the end of the day, the key conclusion, we believe the only conclusion based on the evidence, based on the articles of impeachment themselves, based on the Constitution is you must vote to acquit the president,"" argued Patrick Philbin, deputy counsel to the president. ""At the end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one election and try to interfere in the coming election which begins today in Iowa."" 
At this point, it looks like the vote will be held at 4:00 pm Wednesday to acquit or convict President Trump. 
Meanwhile, CBN News will provide full coverage of the State of the Union address on the CBN News Channel beginning at 8:30 Tuesday night."

Four candidates are locked in a tight race.
The Democratic hopefuls have been hosting multiple events and covering hundreds of miles desperate to win over those last-minute votes. Thousands of Iowans and political tourists crammed into large venues to hear directly from candidates one last time ahead of Monday's vote.
 
After being stuck in impeachment hearings in Washington all week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) made up for lost time on the campaign trail by recruiting her dog Bailey, known as her ""furrogate"", to stand in her place in her famous post-rally selfie line.
 
""It's going to take some big structural change are you ready for that?"" Warren asked an enthusiastic crowd.
 
Nearby, former Vice President Joe Biden addressed a packed gymnasium touting a message of unity. ""I refuse to accept the notion that we're going to be in total chaos and war with the other side because we're done if that's true,"" commented Biden.
 
But he also went on the attack against President Trump.
 
""In a room with our flag officers and generals, he looked them in the eye and referred to them as losers, dopes, and babies – who in God's name does he think he is talking to our people like that?"" questioned Biden. ""To state the obvious, this commander in chief not only doesn't understand it but if he does he's the most calloused son of a gun we've ever had as president.""
 
A day before the caucus, many voters like Daryl Hagans of Des Moines told CBN News they're still undecided.
 
""I'd probably say my top three would be Pete (Buttigieg), Biden and Warren,"" explained Hagans.
 
Monday night could end with the top four, Biden, Warren, Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, seeing only slight differences in their number of delegates.
 
""In our polling, there's about five points that separates the top from the second and they're all sort of bunched together,"" explained political science professor and pollster David Peterson. ""And one thing we know about the Iowa caucuses is attitudes of Iowans are pretty fluid and they change pretty fast in those last couple days.""
 
While Senator Bernie Sanders appears to be leading in the state he narrowly lost four years ago, Peterson speculates his 2020 surge may have peaked.
 
""The supporters of those other four top candidates are much more likely to settle amongst each other than they are to switch over to Sanders,"" noted Peterson.
 
Moderate Democrats like Robert Fuhs of Indiana, a Pete Buttigieg supporter, says he's not quite ready to feel the Bern. ""I don't think the Midwest will go for this. Bernie's idea of immediate healthcare for everybody when 50 percent of the country is pretty happy with what they have right now, I can't imagine that winning,"" Fuhs told CBN News.
 
And others are hesitant to vote Biden back in office.
 
""If it's Biden or Bernie they're too old, I can't vote them, I'm sorry,"" said Mary Marksmeyier of Des Moines, a Buttigieg supporter. ""I'm 68, I would not try to vote for somebody older than me.""
 
But other Democrats stand ready to unite around whoever the nominee ends up being.
 
""I will be behind whoever the candidate will be,"" declared Veronica Tessler, an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
 
""I think it's important that the Democratic Party stay united,"" echoed Sean Nelson, who stands behind Bernie Sanders.
 
Tonight the country and party leadership will get the first glimpse of whether voters prefer moderate candidates like Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg or want a more progressive choice like Senators Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren."

The vote was 51- 49 with Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) going against the party line to side with Democrats for witnesses.
Trump was impeached by the House in December on charges he abused power and obstructed Congress as he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and then chose not to cooperate with the congressional probe of his actions.
It was a significant win for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and President Trump, bypassing what could have been a floor fight over testimony from former National Security Advisor John Bolton and other witnesses. Bolton's upcoming book reportedly claims the president held back aid to Ukraine to pressure it to investigate his possible political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
President Trump pushed back, saying he did nothing wrong at a rally Thursday night in Michigan.
""Remember the tax cut was the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and what do they do?"" Trump asked the audience. ""They impeach you, explain, explain that one. We have great Republicans out there and they don't like it any better than you do. Very partisan situation. A disgrace to our country.""
Sen. John Barrasso, (R-WY), told Fox News on Thursday that he thought senators had heard enough. ""I think, by that time, people will have heard enough,"" Barrasso said. ""They will have learned what they need to know about this case. And the plan is for Friday to vote. And the momentum is moving to say we've heard enough. Let's move to final judgment.""
Under a proposal negotiated Friday by party leaders, the Senate will resume Monday for final arguments, with time Monday and Tuesday for senators to speak. The final vote will be held on Wednesday. "

One of its early victories came in South Dakota this week. Lawmakers voted 46 to 23 in the statehouse to pass a bill that would ban doctors from performing sex-reassignment surgeries like mastectomies and from dispensing puberty-blocking drugs to children under the age of 16.

'Mom, I'm Transgender': Parents Grapple as Trans Phenomenon Explodes
Judge Removed in Case as TX Father Fights to Keep Ex from Turning Their 7-Year-Old Son into a Girl
Former LGBTQers Testify: If You No Longer Want to Be Gay or Transgender, You Don't Have to Be
State Rep. Fred Deutsch, the bill's sponsor, told CBN News he hopes the legislation will protect children in ways similar to other laws already in place. ""We don't let them smoke. We don't let them drink. We don't let them vape,"" he said. ""It just makes sense that we don't want them to be recipients of cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers as young children.""
Lawmakers in several other states are considering similar legislation and Deutsch says he's aware of a dozen or so states that will soon introduce such bills.
He cited a Texas case as helping to galvanize the movement.  CBN News and a number of other media outlets have followed the plight of a seven-year-old boy, caught in a custody battle with parents who disagree about his gender.
Deutsch said it served as a ""tipping point"" for many lawmakers, convincing them to move to safeguard children from medical interventions.
Transgender advocates say that Deutsch's bill will undermine health care for children. 
""This legislature is compromising the health care of trans youth in dangerous and potentially dangerous ways,"" said Libby Skarin, policy director for the ACLU in South Dakota.
Some of the most prominent medical voices in South Dakota and across the country also support pediatric transgender medicine.
The Pediatric Endocrine Society issued a statement in October applauding puberty blockers, calling the treatment ""reversible"" and a good way to alleviate the distress of those suffering from gender dysphoria.
But some endocrinologists, like Dr. Michael Laidlaw, note that there's no FDA evidence to support the claim. Others are concerned that there's no long-term studies supporting the effectiveness of the rapidly growing field of pediatric transgender medicine. Sixty-five pediatric gender clinics have opened their doors in recent years.
Protecting Women's Sports
Lawmakers are also considering a new crop of legislation that aims to protect female athletes in high school from trans athletes who can easily outmatch them on the playing field, thanks to biological differences such as bone density, lung capacity, and physical strength.
GOP lawmakers in nine states have sponsored bills that would help to level the playing field with requirements such as mandating that boys who want to compete as girls identify as a girl on their birth certificate.
That would help in states like Connecticut, where two boys who identify as girls now hold 15 state championship track titles.
Two female track athletes have filed a federal discrimination complaint with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, saying that their opportunities for recruitment and college scholarships are being negatively impacted by the state's transgender policy.
In Washington, a group of GOP lawmakers in the House has introduced a bill to protect female athletes. It would deny Title IX funds to women's sports that allow biological male athletes to compete against biological female athletes.

Two Christian, conservative women are running for Congress in this heavily ""blue"" state. And although the odds may be stacked against them, Liz Joy of Albany and Beth Parlato of Buffalo say in the wake of recent events, they can no longer be silent. 
In January 2019, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act that expanded the right to an abortion for any reason, even to the point of birth. It also eliminated several restrictions on abortion. Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the nation's most aggressive abortion bill into law as state representatives cheered. Later that night, the governor ordered the One World Trade Center to be lit in pink to celebrate the event and ""shine a bright light forward for the rest of the nation to follow."" 
Last Straw 
It was the straw that broke the camel's back for attorney Beth Parlato of Buffalo and real estate agent and author Liz Joy of Albany.
""I've had enough,"" said Liz Joy, a Republican running in New York's 20th Congressional district. ""When you have people that are supposed to be role models for your children, the governor of New York, clapping and cheering and lighting up buildings for aborting children all the way up until to the time of delivery, I just decided that I've had enough,"" she said.
Joy is a doctor's wife and mother of four grown children who has never run for political office before. She says as a Christian and life-long resident of New York, she couldn't stand by and do nothing. ""Our country is built on this Judeo-Christian foundation and I see in the House of Representatives we have professed socialists, socialists do not respect human life, socialists do not respect freedom,"" Joy said.
Running for Love of Family
Beth Parlato, whose campaign ad features her big Italian family passing around grandma's pasta and meatballs, says it's her love of family and family values that compelled her to run in New York's 27th Congressional district.
 
""As a Conservative and as a Christian, the family is everything to me, my kids are everything. What kind of world are we going to have for our children and my grandchildren if we don't do something about what's going on in our nation right now?"" Parlato asked. 
Although Joy and Parlato have plenty of passion, what they'll need come election day are votes and as the new kids on the block, they face an uphill battle. 
Taking on a Career Politician
Liz Joy is running in a Democratic stronghold against incumbent Paul Tonko, a 70-year old career politician, who has held the seat since 2009. He voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which protects babies who survive a botched abortion. He voted that those infant children should not receive any medical care. He's also a strong supporter of Planned Parenthood. 
""I'm deeply concerned regarding the misguided fixation to take away valuable resources from women with efforts to de-fund Planned Parenthood,"" Tonko said. 
Joy says Tonko's abortion views are too extreme for many New Yorkers, even some Democrats.
 
""I am conservative but I am also pro-choice but I think that was too aggressive,"" said one local businesswoman. 
Ben said, ""this kind of decision is between women and their doctors and not male legislators.""
When asked if she was ok being a resident of a state with some of the most aggressive abortion laws in the nation, Rose Mary said, ""Well, yes. Because I think the government should really get out of making that decision."" And Larry, from upstate New York, said, ""I don't like it. I think taking a human life is wrong and I don't think inconvenience is something that should justify that.""
Meanwhile, Beth Parlato is running in the state's most Republican district, New York's 27th just outside of Buffalo. The attorney, former judge and Fox News contributor will try to fill the seat previously held by Republican Chris Collins. Collins recently resigned before pleading guilty to charges related to insider trading. ""The election to win in this election is the primary,"" said Parlato. ""So whoever gets through the Primary will be the next Congressman or woman."" 
One Election Away from Socialism?
Parlato believes we are one election away from socialism and says there are far too few conservative women in office. 
""We have 13 Republican women in Congress,"" Parlato said. ""There are 90 Democratic women in Congress, so the loudest voices are the voices on the left and we don't even hear anything from the Republican women. We need more Republican women to sit at that table and to get things done for our families, for our nation and really for the voters in New York State in my district,"" said Parlato.
In order to sit at that table, Parlato will have to beat two other Republicans, both current New York State Senators, Robb Ortt and Chris Jacobs. But Parlato believes she has the edge. 
""Everywhere I go, no matter where I speak at, speaking in front of home school groups or conservative Christian groups, or Christian radio or even conservative radio, no matter where I go – the reception has been overwhelming I'm getting enormous support,"" Parlato said.
For Joy, winning in a solidly blue district will depend in large part on the Evangelical turn-out. In 2016 she wrote a book called How to be Salt and Light – The Christian's Guide to Voting. She says if believers will get out and vote they can change the political landscape of America.
""In 2016, the country had the largest Evangelical Christian voting block that ever turned out in the history of the nation to vote and we have Pres. Donald Trump, as a result, a pro-life president and pro-Israel."" Joy said. ""Christians need to be steering the country instead of it being the other way around."" 
Win or lose on election day, Parlato and Joy say this is not the time to be silent. They hope their campaigns will inspire others to let their voices be heard, for such a time as this. The New York Republican Primary is June 23rd.

It's looking like Republicans now have the votes to shut down Democrats' attempt to call witnesses.
The Democrats needed four Republican votes, but two of the ones they were hoping for - Tennessee's Sen. Lamar Alexander and Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski - have now announced they've heard enough and will vote against calling witnesses.
Alexander says the president's actions regarding Ukraine, although inappropriate, don't meet the Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense.
 
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, do favor witnesses, but Senate Democrats would still need two more Republicans to vote with them to call witnesses, and that appears very unlikely at this point. If that fails, a vote to acquit the president could happen as soon as late tonight, or tomorrow.

But there are also reports the trial could stretch into next week, even without witnesses. So at the moment, there's no clear end date.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited with Ukrainian President Zelensky Friday, saying the US remains committed to supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia.
And President Trump blasted the impeachment efforts Thursday night at a rally in Iowa. ""The Democrats are trying to overturn the last election. We will make sure that they face another crushing defeat,"" Trump said. 
The president also attacked what he calls ""radical socialist"" Democratic candidates. 
On the Democrat side, some strategists and even some Democratic politicians are concerned about the rise of self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders in the polls in Iowa and other key states. They worry Sanders might win early races and capture the party's nomination but then lose the general election to the president."

LATEST: Liberty Counsel Says New VA LGBTQ Bill Would Mean Baptist Schools Can't Fire Cross-Dressing Teachers
One of the first orders of business for the new majority was ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. The federal deadline to do so passed decades ago, but now Virginia's attorney general and two other states are suing to have it added to the US Constitution.
That was followed by gun restrictions many thought impossible in this traditionally gun-friendly state. Then came new protections for LGBTQ people.
It's astounding considering where the state was just one year ago. Virginia and the nation was shocked after this exchange that revealed a Democratic push to allow abortion up until the moment of birth.
READ: Virginia Democrats Dismantle Abortion Restrictions as Bills Advance in State Legislature
""Where it's obvious a woman is about to give birth, she has physical signs that she is about to give birth,"" asked Republican Delegate Todd Gilbert of his colleague Democratic Delegate Kathy Tran in a committee meeting. ""Would that still be a point that she could request an abortion if she was so certified? She's dilating."" 
""My bill would allow that, yes,"" Tran replied.
That measure failed, but this is a new year. Now Democrats are eagerly rolling back laws intended to reduce abortions, such as the 24 hour waiting period, a required ultrasound before an abortion so a woman can see her child, and information about alternatives. 
""We are discussing repealing provisions that have been added on over the past 20 years that shame women, that impair their ability to make their own decisions,"" said Democratic state Senator Jennifer Boysko during emotional debate on the Senate floor this week.
Republicans argue taking away these tools puts women back in the dark. 
""Instead of informing and educating women. We're telling them, for 24 hours you don't need to know the information in that ultrasound, make a decision without having all of the facts. I thought we were about empowering women,"" argued Republican Senator Amanda Chase.
Soon nurse practitioners and physicians assistants will be allowed to perform abortions instead of just doctors.
While many Virginians are surprised at the speedy changes, it's exactly what Democrats promised on the campaign trail leading to their historic victory.
""If we have a majority, the work of a lifetime is the work of two afternoons,"" Democratic Delegate Alfonso Lopez explained to voters over the summer.
 
Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who is a pediatric neurologist by trade, is expected to sign the new abortion policies into law, along with the other laws passed by a legislative majority focused on bringing its vision the Old Dominion.
Last year Northam was accused of promoting infanticide for saying it's okay to allow sick babies to die after they've been born.

The GOP senators are facing a decision over whether to call for more witnesses or acquit. Several media outlets are reporting they are on the verge of bringing a quick and sudden end to the proceedings on Capitol Hill. 
Thursday was the final day of questions and answers before the crucial vote on calling witnesses which is expected Friday.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) tried to expose the name of the still anonymous whistleblower in the public trial but was unsuccessful. 
Putting forward his question to Chief Justice John Roberts, Roberts looked at the question and then responded: ""The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted.""  He did not say what was in the note. 
Roberts had earlier told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he did not want to read the whistle blower's name.
""I don't know who the whistleblower is. Adam Schiff doesn't know who the whistleblower is. My question's not about the whistleblower,"" Paul said. ""My question's about two people who were friends who worked together at the National Security Council who have been overheard talking about impeaching the president years in advance.""
But the big question of the day is do the Democrats have enough votes to call witnesses? 
""We need the four votes,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) House impeachment manager. ""First, the Republicans can call any witness they want right now. What they are afraid of is the witnesses we've asked for.  And so that is the first step. Now if we get the four votes – I imagine there would be some negotiations.""
 ""It seems like every question, if not every other question, gets back to the fundamental issue of relevant documents, relevant witnesses, and I think that the other side was having great trouble for days now explaining why there weren't for witnesses or documents and that got even more difficult in light of the Bolton disclosures,"" said Sen. Bob Casey, (D-PA)
""Did the House try to follow up on any of their witnesses or getting witnesses or subpoenas to the courts during that 33 days that Nancy Pelosi held onto their articles of impeachment? And the answer was no. And so now for them to claim they need witnesses when they didn't do their job in the House is just wrong,"" said Rep. Debbie Lesko, (R-AZ)
Democrats especially want to call former National Security Advisor John Bolton to testify. His upcoming book reportedly claims the president held back aid to Ukraine to pressure it to investigate his possible political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
However, there seems to be growing optimism among the Republican senators that they have the momentum to shut down the trial, but exactly how that proceeds is still anyone's guess. 
""I think, by that time, people will have heard enough,"" Sen. John Barrasso, (R-WY), told ""Fox News @ Night."" ""They will have learned what they need to know about this case. And the plan is for Friday to vote. And the momentum is moving to say we've heard enough. Let's move to final judgment."""

But now three Democrat state attorneys general want to change that ruling. They are suing the archivist of the United States to force him to recognize Virginia's vote this week to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and certify the measure as part of the Constitution. 
The lawsuit filed Thursday comes after the National Archives and Records Administration said this week that the archivist would ""take no action to certify the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment,"" which would prohibit discrimination based on sex. 
The three attorneys general, Mark Herring of Virginia, Kwame Raoul of Illinois, and Aaron Ford of Nevada argue that US laws do not give the archivist the power to decide whether to certify an amendment.

Justice Dept. Says 1972 Equal Rights Amendment Is Dead, 'States and Congress Cannot Resurrect It'
Virginia Passed the ERA Even Though the Justice Dept Says It's Dead
Amendment Can't Be Legally Resurrected
In its 38-page opinion published on Jan. 20, the Justice Department said recent efforts at ratification by Virginia Democrats to revive the ERA are futile. The Office of Legal Counsel, which are the in-house lawyers for the Executive Branch of the federal government, said the time limit Congress put on the ratification process back in the 1970s was valid and has long since passed, according to The Washington Times. 
No action by state legislatures or Congress can resurrect it, the Justice Department said. 
Last week, Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the ERA, even though Congress set a 1982 deadline for its ratification. The move by Virginia Democrats is being called ""virtue signaling"" or ""showmanship"" since the ERA has been ruled long dead. 
""We conclude that Congress had the constitutional authority to impose a deadline on the ratification of the ERA and, because that deadline has expired, the ERA Resolution is no longer pending before the states,"" Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel wrote.
The act's original intent was to give women equal rights. But critics say it's poorly written, overly broad, and will have unintended consequences that could affect everything from abortion to maternity leave - even women's sports.
Amendment Would Take Away Opportunities for Women 
During an interview with CBN News earlier this month, Senior Counsel Matt Sharp with Alliance Defending Freedom said the ERA would add sex as a protected classification under the Constitution. 
""It would result in men being allowed to compete in women's sports and take away opportunities for women. It can also be used to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right and force taxpayers to pay for it,"" he explained. 
Sharp added that the Constitution already offers women multiple protections.
""There is the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, ensuring that every American is treated equally under the law and we have numerous federal laws already on the books such as Title 9 and others that ensure women cannot be discriminated against,"" he noted. ""What the ERA is going to do is actually undermine some of those existing protections and erode the hard-fought gains that women have made over the years.""
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to ERA Supporters: 'Start Over'
""The ERA is legally dead and this is an opinion shared by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who recently opined that if the ERA proponents want to see this, they need to start over because this deadline is decades long gone,"" Sharp added. ""This is a last-minute push by activists who ignored that deadline. This is a failed effort to try and push something that the states have ultimately rejected and they decided they didn't want in our Constitution.""
Sharp believes ERA supporters could try to push this case all the way to the US Supreme Court.
""I think the other side is obviously very motivated. This may end up in the Supreme Court, but I think we can all agree that this deadline has passed. Even if it had not, the ERA is a bad law that we should not be pushing for to add to our Constitution,"" he concluded."

President Trump spoke at the march, making history as the first sitting president to attend in person.
""Young people are the heart of the march for life and it's your generation that is making America the pro-life, pro-woman nation,"" Trump said from the podium.
Those 200 students, invited by march organizers, came from Colorado Christian University, a small, private school in the Denver area.   
""We believe that every single human life is inherently valuable, whether that's in the womb, whether that's at the end of life too,"" Ethan Van Buskirk, a CCU student and president of CCU for Life, told CBN News.
And this younger interest seems to be a growing trend.
A Marist/Knights of Columbus poll from February 2019 showed a significant shift among people under the age of 45. That January, 28 percent identified as pro-life. Just one month later, that number jumped to 47 percent. Those identifying as pro-choice fell drastically, from 65 to 48 percent.
Pollsters credit the shift to last year's debate over late-term abortion, fueled by measures in New York and Virginia.
""The more people I talk to, the more I am starting to learn that, yes, we're not alone in this,"" Jessica Hardman, another CCU student, told CBN News. ""There are more people than we think.""
Hardman and her peers point to science, technology and their faith as the main reasons behind their views.
""For me personally, I would say my faith is what inspires me to be specifically passionate about life,"" said Katie McTavish. ""I believe in a God who has created life that every human being has value.""
Other data though does still show strong support for abortion among Millennials.
In a Gallup poll from last January, 32 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds said abortion should be legal under any circumstance. That compares to 21 percent of those 55 and older who felt the same way.
Still, the students from CCU said they can't help but notice what's happening around them.
""I absolutely think it's growing,"" Hardman said of the pro-life movement. ""Last year my school took 27 students (to the March for Life) and this year we took almost 200."""

Until now, senators acting as jurors in the trial have had to remain silent. This was the first chance to ask questions, but on a grand scale. Senators must ask written questions only. Then they must pass them on to Chief Justice John Roberts who reads them aloud to the entire Senate. 
Three out of the four Republicans who could end up siding with Democrats in calling for documents and more witnesses in the trial got to ask the first question. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) posed a question to the White House defense team around motives.

Trump's Legal Team Accuses Democrats of Trying to Unseat a Duly Elected Leader
Chief Justice Roberts read the question aloud ahead of the White House response. 
""How should the Senate consider more than one motive in its assessment of article 1? If there were a motive that was of public interest but also of some personal interest, we think it follows even more clearly that that cannot possibly be the basis of an impeachable defense.""
White House lawyer Pat Philbin responded there's nothing wrong with the president acting on a personal as well as national interest. He declared the charge against Trump ""absurd.""
One of the most important questions hanging over the trial, in general, is whether it matters if there was a quid pro quo behind the US financial aid gifted to Ukraine. That's a question Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) asked the president's defense team. 
Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a member of the White House legal team, jumped at the answer.
""Quid pro quo – If you don't do it, you don't get the money. If you do it you get the money. There's no one in this chamber that would regard that as in any way unlawful. The only thing that would make a quid pro quo unlawful is if the quo was in some way illegal,"" Dershowitz replied. 
In short, this could take a while. In fact, senators have a total of 16 hours to pose questions to both sides.
The Big Question: Will Witnesses Be Called? 
Another big question looming over all of this is whether or not the Senate will call more witnesses. 
The vote on witnesses is expected to be held on Friday. But even that won't ensure witnesses will be called. There will be a separate vote held for each individual witness. 
Democrats are looking for eyewitnesses – people they describe as being ""in the room,"" including former National Security Advisor John Bolton. 
Republicans are floating the idea of calling former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden, but that's something Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) hit back at today.
""It's a terrible argument for the president here. The House managers have argued that the president was willing to risk our national security and risk the sanctity of our elections to go after Joe Biden and his son. Now they're saying we even want to risk the solemnity of a trial in the Senate on impeachment to go after Biden and his son – it's irrelevant,"" Schumer said. ""It's a distraction. It's running away from the truth and it's up to the Republicans and solely the Republicans to do it – we're not for it.""
The Democrats' push to call Bolton as a witness comes amid reports of Bolton's soon to be released tell-all book. But its publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to ""significant amounts of classified information"" in the manuscript, including at the top-secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted that the book does not contain any classified information.
Democrats on the Hill are warning that senators will be kicking themselves for not asking for more evidence after Bolton's book, which they say will provide key relevant information for the trial. "

But now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is warning that enough Republicans may join the Democrats to demand witnesses testify, adding some major uncertainty to the next phase.
Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney, took a dismissive swipe at an unpublished book by John Bolton that is said to contradict a key defense argument.
“It is not a game of leaks and un-sourced manuscripts,"" said Sekulow. “That's politics, unfortunately.""
He was referring to media reports about a soon to be released book by Trump's former national security adviser, who writes that Trump told him that he wanted to withhold military aid from Ukraine until it helped with investigations into Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump and his lawyers have repeatedly insisted he never tied the security aid to political investigations.
One of the president's lawyers, Deputy White House Counsel Pat Philbin, told the senators that America's Founding Fathers took care to make sure that impeachment was narrowly defined, with impeachable offenses clearly enumerated.
“There has to be a defined offense in advance,"" Philbin said.
Democrats Demanding Witnesses After Bolton Leak
Democrats have demanded witnesses since the Senate trial began, and now some Republicans are expressing openness to the idea. 
In response, one Republican, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, is floating an idea to subpoena Bolton’s book manuscript so senators can see the evidence themselves – but only in private.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) wrote on Twitter that he “totally” supports Lankford's proposal. Graham, a key Trump ally, said the Bolton document should be made available to the Senate, in a classified setting, “where each Senator has the opportunity to review the manuscript and make their own determination.""
However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), called the proposal, which would keep Bolton out of public testimony, “absurd.""  He said, “We're not bargaining with them. We want four witnesses, and four sets of documents, then the truth will come out.""
News of the possible Bolton revelations distracted from hours of arguments Monday by Trump's lawyers, who declared anew that no witness has testified to direct knowledge that Trump's delivery of aid was contingent on investigations into Democrats. 
“We deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information,"" Sekulow reminded senators. “We do not deal with speculation.""
Trump is charged with abusing his presidential power by asking Ukraine's leader to help investigate Biden at the same time his administration was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid. A second charge accuses Trump of obstructing Congress in its probe.
Even as defense lawyers laid out their case as planned, it was clear Bolton's book had scrambled the debate over whether to seek witnesses. Trump's legal team has rejected Bolton's account, and Trump himself denied it. 
“I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,"" Trump tweeted. ""If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.”
Next Phase of the Trial
In the next phase of the trial, senators will get the chance to ask questions of both the House impeachment managers and the president's lawyers during a 16-hour period that will begin in the next day or so. 
The Senate majority and minority will go back and forth posting written questions that will be read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts. 
After the question and answer period, impeachment managers and the president's legal team will debate new evidence and call any new witnesses.
McConnell Facing a Mutiny Over Witnesses?
Senate Majority Leader McConnell told senators privately Tuesday he does not yet have the votes to block new witnesses in the trial.
McConnell convened a closed-door meeting of GOP senators shortly after Trump’s legal team made its closing arguments in the trial, the third and final day of defense proceedings punctuated by revelations from John Bolton, the former national security adviser. A Republican familiar with the meeting was not authorized to describe it by name and requested anonymity, according to The Associated Press. 
The GOP leader faced a handful of potential defections, but several days remained before any potential witness vote would be taken.
A decision to call more witnesses would need 51 votes to pass. With a 53-seat majority, Republicans can only afford to lose three Republicans to prevent more debate over witnesses."

The Iowa caucuses kick-off the Democratic contests that will decide the party's presidential candidate for 2020.
Sanders seems increasingly confident in his ability to win in Iowa. That's creating problems for his more moderate rivals, like Vice President Joe Biden, about how to take on Sanders directly.
""Suddenly, we have the Democratic establishment very nervous about this campaign. We got Wall Street nervous,"" Sanders told a crowd in Sioux City, according to NBC News. ""They're starting to think, could this really happen?""
On Monday, Biden indirectly targeted Sanders about the multi-trillion-dollar cost of his single-payer health insurance, tuition-free college, and broad climate plans. ""I don't think you win votes doing that. I think it scares the living devil out of people,"" Biden said while visiting Cedar Falls, Iowa.
Many Democrats worry that if Sanders gets the party's nomination, he won't be able to beat President Trump in the general election.
""He is a front-runner to win, and if he wins it's going to be incredibly hard to beat Trump and hang onto our House majority,"" said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of the think tank called Third Way.
A new New York Times/Siena College poll shows Sanders with a slight edge in Iowa. But other polls show him neck-and-neck with other candidates.
Sanders is also leading in New Hampshire. An NBC10 Boston/Franklin Pierce/Herald Poll shows Sanders with 29 percent support, followed by Biden at 22 percent, Elizabeth Warren at 16 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 10 percent, and Amy Klobuchar at 5 percent. The Iowa caucuses take place on Feb. 3 and New Hampshire Democrats hold their primary on Feb. 11.
It's worth noting that polls are not a solid prediction of outcomes in caucuses and primaries. The poll numbers can shift from day to day, especially in the aftermath of previous contests. In addition, please note that CBN does not endorse or oppose any candidate for political office.

The Virginia House on Monday advanced legislation that allows nurse practitioners and certified nurse-midwives to perform abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy.
""This law does not appear to limit when someone other than a physician can perform any kind of abortion,"" Virginia House Republican Leader Del. Todd Gilbert pointed out during the debate on the bill.
""These individuals are highly trained and qualified and, indeed Madame Speaker, some of them have to train under a physician for a period of time,"" Virginia House Democrat Leader Del. Charniele Herring responded. 
Democrats now control both houses of the legislature and governor's mansion.
The new majority also plan to put a stop to the Commonwealth's current 24-hour waiting period and requiring ultrasounds before abortions, which have proven successful in reducing the number of abortions.
Similar legislation is moving through the state senate.
Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist by trade, is expected to sign the legislation into law.
CORRECTION: This story originally stated that Virginia Democrats were also trying to remove the requirement that minors get parental consent before aborting their child. CBN News has confirmed that the measure is no longer part of the legislation."

The former national security advisor claims President Trump tied Ukraine security aid to investigating the Bidens.
President Trump's legal team said the commander-in-chief was acting under his constitutional and legal authority, adding that asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of corruption is not breaking the law.

Trump's Legal Team Accuses Democrats of Trying to Unseat a Duly Elected Leader
""I want to keep coming back to facts, facts that are really undisputed,"" said Jay Sekulow, Trump's attorney. ""The president in his conversation was clear on a number of points but so was President Zelensky. I mentioned that at the close of my arguments earlier, it was President Zelensky that said, 'No pressure. I didn't feel any pressure.'"" 
But contradicting to Sekulow's opening argument Monday, the New York Times reported they received an unpublished transcript of Bolton's upcoming book.
In it, Bolton writes President Trump told him in August of last year that he wanted to continue withholding military aid to Ukraine until they launched investigations into the Bidens.
""Not true,"" said Trump as he fielded questions outside the Oval Office. ""Well, I haven't seen a manuscript but I can tell you nothing was ever said to John Bolton. But I have not seen the manuscript. I guess he is writing a book. I have not seen it."" 
White House Counsel Prof. Alan Dershowitz told the Senate on Monday, ""Nothing in the Bolton revelations even if true would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called this revelation a ""White House cover-up,"" while pointing to his counterpart across the aisle for the need to hear from Bolton during the trial. 
""This is stunning. It goes right to the heart of the charges against the president,"" Schumer said. ""Ambassador Bolton essentially confirms the president committed the offenses charged in the first article of impeachment. It boils down to one thing. We have a witness with first-hand evidence of the president's actions for which he is on trial.""
Bolton has said he would testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. Now some Republican senators have also come out saying let him testify.
""I've said for some time I'd like to be able to hear from John Bolton,"" said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT). ""I think with the story that came out yesterday, it's increasingly important to hear from John Bolton.  I will make a final decision on witnesses after we've heard from the prosecution but also the defense. But I think pretty fair to say that John Bolton has a relevant testimony to provide to those of us who are sitting in impartial justice.""
With support growing from both sides, it appears likely the Senate could hear from witnesses.
There are reports that GOP leaders are receptive to a suggestion by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey to allow one prosecution witness in exchange for one defense witness. The question on witnesses could be decided later this week. The president's legal team is expected to wrap up opening arguments today."

On Sunday, the Democratic presidential candidate participated in a town hall event on Fox News, where he fielded a question from Kristen Day, a pro-life Democrat wondering how her party could make room for progressive voters like her.
“Do you want the support of pro-life Democrats, pro-life Democratic voters?” she asked Buttigieg. “There are about 21 million of us, and if so, would you support more moderate platform language in the Democratic Party to ensure that the party of diversity and inclusion really does include everybody?”
“I hope to earn your vote,” the 37-year-old candidate replied, “but I’m not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you.”
That is a big step from a candidate who has spent months avoiding even entertaining the question of abortion, often telling his questioners the morality of the procedure is simply “unknowable.”
Buttigieg told Day that while they couldn’t come to a consensus on “where to draw the line” when it comes to abortion, he hoped they could maybe agree “on who should draw the line, and in my view, it’s the woman who’s faced with that decision in her own life.”
FAITHWIRE  Buttigieg Says His Christian Faith Inspires Him to Work Towards a World Without Weapons
Unsatisfied with Buttigieg’s answer, Fox News moderator Chris Wallace gave Day a second shot at her question. She asked the former mayor if he would be “open” to making the Democratic Party’s platform on abortion more “diverse and inclusive,” particularly for pro-life progressives, because, as she said, they “have no part in the party.”
Buttigieg toed the party line.
“I support the position of my party,” he said, “that this kind of medical care needs to be available to everyone, and I support the Roe v. Wade framework that holds that, early in pregnancy, there are very few restrictions, and late in pregnancy, there are very few exceptions, and again, the best I can offer is that we may disagree on that very important issue, and hopefully, we will be able to partner on other issues.”

GOP Sen. Mitt Romney led the way saying it is “increasingly apparent it is important to hear” from former national security adviser John Bolton about a leak from his upcoming book that appears to undercut a key defense argument.
GOP Sen. Susan Collins agreed about calling Bolton, tweeting, ""I’ve always said that I was likely to vote to call witnesses, just as I did in the 1999 Clinton trial."" 
In The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir, The New York Times reports Bolton writes that President Trump ""wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens.""
But Deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura asked how there could have been a quid quo with Ukraine when the Ukrainians were not even aware that the security assistance was paused. 
Purpura told the Senate, ""There can't be a threat without the person knowing he's being threatened. There can't be a quid pro quo without the quo.""
President Trump flatly denied the claims from Bolton's book, tweeting, 
""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.""

Saturday, President Trump's lawyers began their defense in the impeachment trial.
The president's attorney Jay Sekulow told senators, ""We intend to show over the next several days that the evidence is actually really overwhelming that the President did nothing wrong.""
And as for the charge of obstruction of Congress, White House Deputy Counsel Patrick Philbin said the subpoenas issued by Schiff's committees were invalid because they were not authorized by the full House, ""because under long-settled precedent, there had to be a vote from the House to have authority and the administration would not respond to subpoenas which were invalid.""
Meanwhile, President Trump lashed out at House impeachment manager Adam Schiff, tweeting, 
""Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man. He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!
Schiff told NBC's Meet The Press he considered the tweet a threat, telling Meet the Press, ""This is a wrathful and vindictive president. I don't think there's any doubt about it."" 
John Bolton has said he will testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. Democrats say reports about his new book show that Bolton must testify. President Trump says House Democrats should have done their job when it was their responsibility:
The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify. It is up to them, not up to the Senate!

After three days of presentations by the Democrats making the case against the president, Trump's lawyers said they plan to deliver the bulk of their case on Monday and Tuesday laying out facts they argue will be sufficient to ""sink the Democrats case.""

Democrats Reiterate First Impeachment Charge on Day 2, Skeptical Senators Say 'Not Much New Here'
Deputy White House counsel Mike Purpura speaking during the impeachment proceedings said his team will present six ""key facts"" that will show the president did nothing wrong when he asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. 
Among those facts Purpura said was that Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Biden matter after raising concerns about potential corruption.
""Everyone knows by now President Trump asked Presidents Zelenskiy to do us a favor and he made clear that the US referred to our country and not himself,"" Purpura argued. ""Presidents Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.""
Jay Sekulow, attorney for President Trump, accused Democratic prosecutors of omitting key evidence when they presented their case and is urging Senate members to acquit his client on charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress.
""This case is really not about presidential wrongdoing,"" Sekulow argued. ""This entire impeachment process is about the House manager's insistence that they are able to read everybody's thoughts. They can read everybody's intention, even when the principal speakers, the witnesses themselves, insist that those interpretations are wrong.""
The first part of Trump's defense lasted only two hours and as soon as the Senate was adjourned, House impeachment managers and other high-ranking Democratic leaders took to the cameras and Twitter accusing Trump's legal team of ""trying to deflect, distract from, and distort the truth.""
Lead impeachment prosecutor, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) tweeted that today's proceedings showed the president's lawyers did not ""contest the facts of Trump's scheme"" while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said, ""I don't think the president's counsel did a very good job - there are gaping holes in their testimony."" 
Schumer added that there was a ""compelling case"" for why the Senate should allow new witnesses to testify and permit new documents to be introduced as part of the Senate's impeachment proceedings.
""We have been making the argument that we need witnesses, we need documents,"" Schumer said during a press conference. ""We are making the argument it won't take very long to get them as part of a trial. Today, we thank the president's counsel for one thing: they made our case even stronger.""
President Trump's attorneys will continue to make their case on Monday."

As Democrats pressed their case before skeptical Republican senators for the third day, the president's legal team is preparing its defense, expected to start Saturday.
The Senate jurors faced another long day Friday armed with pens and paper — and, for Republicans, the gift of fidget spinners — for the historic trial.
Before Friday's session began, Senate Chaplain Barry Black prayed, ""Lord guide them with your wisdom... in spite of disagreements may they strive for civility... give them the wisdom to distinguish between facts and opinions.""
Democrat prosecutors have two articles of impeachment they're trying to convince the Senate about, and they spent all of Thursday evening on the first article which claims ""abuse of power"". So they're spending Friday focusing on their second article, claiming the President obstructed their investigation.
GOP senators, who are growing tired of the long hours of the trial, have defended Trump's actions in dealing with Ukraine as appropriate. They consider the impeachment process as a politically motivated effort to weaken him in his reelection campaign. 
Trump's defense team is now arguing that the impeachment articles against him are invalid because the articles do not allege that he committed a specific crime.
The president's attorney Jay Sekulow said, ""We will be putting on a vigorous defense of both facts, rebutting what they said,"" and the Constitution.
The Senate is heading next week toward a pivotal vote on Democratic demands for testimony from top Trump aides, including acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton who refused to appear before the House. It would take four Republican senators to join the Democratic minority to seek witnesses, and so far the numbers appear lacking.
""This needs to end,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a Trump confidant. He said he doesn't want to hear from Bolton or the Bidens.
During their presentations, Democrats have been summarizing much of the evidence and testimony already presented during televised House impeachment hearings.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) said the Democrats were putting forward ""admirable presentations."" But he said, ""There's just not much new here.""
Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) said it seemed like ""Groundhog Day in the Senate.""
The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer (NY), acknowledged that many senators ""really don't want to be here.""
Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and acquittal of President Trump is considered likely. "

""The first article of impeachment charges the president with abuse of power,"" House impeachment manager Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) said. ""President Trump used the powers of his office to solicit a foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own personal benefit. Note that the act of solicitation itself, just the ask, constitutes an abuse of power. But President Trump went further.""
Republican senators, who hold a majority in the chamber and will vote on Trump's conviction or acquittal, exhibited no reaction.

The Democratic prosecutors argued in the impeachment trial before skeptical Republican senators and a watchful American public that Trump sought a political investigation of Biden from Ukraine for his own gain to sway the 2020 election in his favor.
Ahead of the day's proceedings, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said the Democrats were putting forward ""admirable presentations."" But he said, ""They've basically got about one hour of presentation, and they gave it six times on Tuesday and eight times yesterday. There's just not much new here.""
Trump blasted the proceedings in a Thursday morning tweet, declaring them the ""Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!""
The question of calling witnesses will be worked out after the president's team has 24 hours to present their case. The strategy of more witnesses, though, seemed all but settled. Republicans rejected Democratic efforts to get Trump aides including former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, to testify in back-to-back votes earlier this week.
Senators appear likely to repeat that rejection next week.
""I want to end this thing sooner rather than later. I don't want to turn it into a circus,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). ""I think Schumer said yesterday he wouldn't trade Joe Biden. I think I know why. I want the American people to pick the next president, not me. So I think the best thing is to have oversight of Ukrainian misconduct and move on to the election.

David Brody: ""Democrats want to see John Bolton testify.  Do you have any reason to believe John Bolton has any information that would be worthy of bringing him forward?
Vice President Mike Pence:  ""I think all the call for additional witnesses and evidence just proves how a weak a case the Democrats have rushed through the House of Representatives.  It really is amazing. This comes down to a phone call that the President made with President Zelensky of Ukraine.  People can read the transcript of the call and see there was no quid-pro-quo.  The President did nothing wrong.  Beyond that the Democrats rushed this partisan impeachment through the House and now having sat on their partisan impeachment for a month, they come to the Senate having told us that they have an overwhelming case against the president saying now they need new evidence, they need new witnesses.  And I hold the view that the Senate ought to evaluate this partisan impeachment, the articles, the evidence that were amassed in the House, look at everything that they've brought over and make their decision.  I think that when they look at those facts, this president will be acquitted and frankly we'll put this chapter, this partisan impeachment in the rearview mirror and maybe, just maybe get the Democrats in Congress to begin to Focus on the things that President Trump and I have always focused on, every day of this administration – making America more secure, making our borders more secure, making our economy more prosperous, seeing conservatives appointed to our courts at every level, focusing on the things that matter most to the American people.""

They can if they want. It's a question of conscience. Senate Republicans have the power in their hands to make it a fair trial. Will they use it when it matters? The next real test will come after Q and A when we revisit the issue of witnesses and documents.""
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OHIO) responded in a tweet. ""House Dems couldn't be bothered to wait for the Courts to decide on witnesses. They said impeachment was urgent!"" he wrote. ""Now in the Senate, they're admitting how weak their case is by demanding more witnesses.""

House Minority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) also tweeted about Democrats' refusal to go to court, writing: ""A Democrat Impeachment Manager admitted the reason they're doing this is because going to court wouldn't have been quick enough to get this done before the election. Now we know why we're really here: So Dems can try to rig the 2020 election.""
Along with his tweet, Scalise posted a video of Rep. Val Demings (D-FL), another House manager arguing before the Senate last night. 
There it is folks.

Also for the first time since the trial began, President Trump spoke about the Senate trial.  He's been overseas the last couple days, but is heading back to Washington tonight. 
Before boarding Air Force One, Trump called a surprise news conference. He lashed out at Democrats in the trial calling it a ""hoax"", adding he'd like to ""sit in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces.""
""I think it's so bad for our country when we have the head of the World Trade Organization here and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect that nobody talks about,"" he said. ""I never see them talking about transcription. I never see them talking about the call because there is nothing to say. You read it. Somebody should sit there and read it and everybody is going to say that is an impeachable event?""
The latest Politico/Morning Consult poll reveals 47% are in favor of Trump's removal from office with 45% opposed. 
President Trump's lawyers will now get three days to make their case that the commander-in-chief did not commit a crime. But first up are Democrat prosecutors who get the same amount of time to prove he did. 
Trump said he supports former National Security Advisor John Bolton and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney testifying during the Senate trial. But in the end, it will be up to the Senate to decide. 
""I'd love to have Mike Pompeo testify but again that is a national security problem,"" he said. ""But it's a national security problem. I'd love to have Rick Perry. Rick Perry has asked me, 'I would love to testify. Please let me testify' because he knows this is a hoax. He understands it better than most. Rick Perry would love to testify. We are dealing with national security.""
Trump's lawyers say House Democrats rushed to impeach without fighting for witnesses in court. The commander-in-chief praised his legal team saying he ""thought they did a very good job."""

The President is in Europe, arriving at the World Economic Forum in Geneva, Switzerland as his impeachment trial got underway. ""We are bringing back tremendous business in the United States and they're all here to see,"" Trump said. ""I'll be making a speech and then we'll be leaving shortly. But I think it's very important. The other is just a hoax. It is a witch hunt that's been going on for years and it's frankly, it's disgraceful.""
Trump's legal team outlined his defense strategy in a brief, arguing the President did ""absolutely nothing wrong"" calling it a ""rigged process.""
They added that Trump is the victim of a partisan plot ""to corrupt the extraordinary power of impeachment for use as a political tool to overturn the result of the 2016 election and to interfere in the 2020 election.""
Are the Charges Sufficient for Impeachment?
""It needs to be criminal behavior, criminal in nature,"" said Alan Dershowitz, a member of the President's legal team. ""The articles of impeachment are two non-criminal actions, namely obstruction of Congress and abuse of power.""
The brief adds ""the framers adopted a standard that requires a violation of established law to state an impeachable offense. By contrast, in their articles of impeachment, House Democrats have not even attempted to identify any law that was violated.""
But some legal scholars state the President doesn't have to break the law to commit an impeachable offense. 
Democrats say ""the facts are indisputable and the evidence is overwhelming"" that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate a political rival. 
""If the President is so confident in his case if Leader McConnell is so confident the President did nothing wrong, why don't they want the case to be presented in broad daylight?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) asked. 
""We believe that once you hear those initial presentations the only conclusion will be that the President has done nothing wrong,"" White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told the senators.  
Cipollone will represent Trump along with his personal attorney Jay Sekulow. 
Sekulow Turns the Tables on Schiff
Tuesday afternoon, Sekulow turned the tables on House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) by quoting his own words against him. 
Schiff was arguing against executive privilege, claiming the president had obstructed the Democrats’ impeachment inquiry by telling his senior aides not to comply with congressional subpoenas that directed them to testify in front of the House committees.
Sekulow reminded Schiff of the words he once used when the Republican-led House held President Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for refusing to release documents relating to Operation Fast and Furious.
Sekulow said, ""Mr. Manager Schiff wrote at the time, 'The White House assertion of privilege is backed by decades of precedent that has recognized the need for the President and his senior advisers to receive candid advice and information from their top aides.'""
""Indeed that's correct,"" Sekulow said, ""Not because Mr. Schiff said it, because the Constitution requires it.""
Meanwhile, House Democrats were calling Cipollone a ""material fact witness"" who should be disqualified from defending the commander-in-chief.
The White House responded calling Democrats an ""utter joke"" saying this move to remove one of Trump's lawyers is a ""political stunt.""
A Prayer from Chaplain Barry Black
With partisanship on full display, even before the afternoon trial session began, Senate Chaplain Barry Black took a moment in his opening prayer to remind all those present and watching on television on whom we can all rely.
""We declare that You alone are our hope,"" Black prayed.
A Rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts
As the arguments went late into the night, a clash over witnesses brought a rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler said, ""President Trump does not want you to hear from Ambassador Bolton. It has nothing to do with executive privilege or this other nonsense.""
Cipollone replied, ""The only one who should be embarrassed Mr. Nadler is YOU.""
Roberts stepped in, ""I think it's important for me to admonish the counsel for both... I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are."""

'I Think You Called Me a Liar on National TV': Amid Sanders-Warren Spat, Dems Worry They Can't Beat Trump
This Moment Is Getting All the Attention from the Final Democrat Debate Before Crucial Iowa Caucus
As Biden and Bernie Battle for Lead Before Big Iowa Caucus, Here's What's Giving Dems Headaches
Now, they're compelled to stay in Washington, DC, at least while the trial is in session. They're also forbidden from using electronic devices on the Senate floor.
Instead, the candidates have deployed surrogates to do their bidding in Iowa. 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a far-left Democrat from New York, will appear in Iowa this weekend on behalf of Sanders. ""Queer Eye"" host Jonathan Van Ness will also be in Iowa stumping for Warren, in addition to Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who will be in New Hampshire.
And more than a dozen supporters of Klobuchar, for instance, held a news conference on Tuesday on the steps of the New Hampshire state capitol.
Polls show Joe Biden leading in Iowa with Warren close behind and Sanders and Klobuchar within shouting distance.
Biden, 77, will have Iowa completely to himself for a final campaign push in his third bid for the presidency as his Democrat colleagues hear the impeachment trial in the Senate.
Biden and Sanders' durability in their late 70s has surprised many Democrats and prompted questions about representation and electability in a party that will count on high turnout among women, minorities and young voters in November's general election.
With the first caucus and primary votes yet to be cast, Democrat sentiment could still quickly turn against any of the candidates. 
Other campaigns have been grappling with how best to cut into the support of frontrunners like Biden and Sanders. Some political pundits place Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the more moderate camp, which pits him against Biden in the battle for moderate voters.
Meanwhile, progressive favorites Warren and Sanders have clashed a bit, but both tried to back away from the first rift that emerged last week: a disagreement over whether Sanders told Warren in a private meeting that a woman can't beat Trump."

Trial rules allow each side 24 hours to present their case over three days. House managers begin their prosecution when proceedings pick back up today as the jury of senators sits silently and listens.
Democrats are demanding the Senate call up new witnesses to testify against Trump in the Senate trial. Republicans say Democrats already called up their own witness during the House hearings and they seem unlikely to call up new ones.

Senate Trial Rules
Those rules call for several grueling 12-hour-long sessions designed to bring the trial to a quicker conclusion.
McConnell wants to give each side 24 hours spread over four days for opening statements with no guarantee that witnesses or new evidence would be allowed during the proceedings.
After that, senators will be given 16 hours to question the prosecution and defense teams, followed by four hours of debate.
Then there will be a vote to decide if the trial should continue.
Senate 'Cover-up' or 'Rigged' House Hearings?
McConnell's Democratic counterpart, Chuck Schumer, called the rules proposals a ""cover-up"" and rushed and vowed to press for a vote on the Senate floor on the matter of permitting new witnesses and documents.
""It's clear McConnell is hell bent on making it much more difficult to get witnesses and documents and intent on rushing the trial through,"" Schumer said.

The Charges Against Trump
House Democrats impeached the president last month on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
President Trump's defense team released a 110-page brief Tuesday saying he did neither and that the charges against him do not constitute a crime or impeachable offense, calling on the Senate to reject the charges immediately and acquit the president.
""The position is that he didn't do any of these things, that he is innocent as a matter of fact,"" argued, Alan Dershowitz, the president's constitutional representative.

""When you have someone who indicted for a crime, let's assume you have evidence, but the grand jury indicts for something that is simply not a crime, and that's what happened here,"" he said.

Democrats Take Steps to Undermine Electoral College after Hillary Clinton's 2016 Loss to Trump
Another State Rejects Electoral College as Democrats Advance Effort to Win 2020 Presidential Race
Why There Would Be No America without the Electoral College
There's been an effort nationwide, led mainly by members of the Democrat Party, to bypass or abolish the original intent of the Electoral College. The effort has escalated since the 2016 election in which Hillary Clinton won the popular vote while Donald Trump won in enough states to win the Electoral College and the presidency.
READ: Why There Would Be No America without the Electoral College
In all, five presidents in American history have won office while losing the popular vote, including two of the last three: Trump and George W. Bush, according to The New York Times. 
The current system requires a presidential candidate to win the states, not just individual voters. That ensures less-populated states still have a voice.
Experts say the Founders created the Electoral College to make sure smaller states had a say in picking the person who would be their national leader. ""If you go back to the Framers, they wanted an Electoral College because they wanted to create a balance between the heavily-populated and less-populated areas of the country,"" The Heritage Foundation's elections expert Hans von Spakovsky told CBN News. 
""And they were afraid that if a president was elected by a national popular vote, the candidates would only go to the big cities,"" he continued. ""They would ignore the rural areas - you know, the places that folks in New York call 'flyover country'.""
As CBN News reported last March, even some of the Democrat candidates for president have called for the Electoral College to be abolished. 
""We can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said. 
So far, 15 states and the District of Columbia have passed NPVIC legislation.
Colorado was one of those states that passed the measure.  Jerry Sonnenberg, a Colorado Republican state senator, told The Times he opposed the bill because he believed the change would weaken the electoral power of sparsely populated rural states like Wyoming and Utah while strengthening states like California and New York.
In his view, the Electoral College was created so that ""people in rural areas did not get overrun by the masses.""
""I think it's completely appropriate that we keep the Electoral College,"" he said."

Speaking in Texas, Trump blasted the Democrats, telling an audience his administration has achieved what no other administration has achieved before. ""And what do I get out of it? Tell me. I get impeached. That's what I get, by these radical left lunatics,"" Trump said.
A member of the president's legal team, constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz, believes the Democrats' case against Trump is basically dead on arrival in the Senate because the House charged the president on a non-impeachable offense.

As White House Prepares Defense, Senate Republicans Plan Speedy Trial
Dershowitz told ABC's ""ThisWeek"" program, ""You have a lot of evidence, disputed evidence that could go either way, but the vote was to impeach for abuse of power, which is not within the constitutional criteria for impeachment."" 
House Impeachment Manager Rep. Adam Schiff says, ""Abuse of power is at the center of what the Framers intended an impeachable offense to be.""
But Dershowitz says, ""Half of American presidents have been accused by their political enemies of abusing their power. The Framers didn't want to have that kind of criteria in the Constitution because it weaponizes impeachment for partisan purposes.""
While the idea of instantly dismissing the impeachment articles is off the table, Dershowitz says there may be no need for witnesses if his opening argument succeeds.
Some senators say opening the door to more witnesses could stretch the trial out to as long as two months.
Republican Sen. Ted Cruz (TX) told Fox News, ""I think it's certainly possible for this trial to only go one or two weeks. On the other hand, if the Senate makes a decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it to 6, 8 weeks or even longer. So, I think there are two paths here.""

Pelosi Gloats 'the President Is Impeached for Life', Giuliani Says Senate Can Undo It
Each senator, for their part, took both an oral and written oath to do impartial justice.
Opening arguments began Tuesday afternoon and the big question is what strategy will Democratic impeachment managers, led by Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), employ.
Democrats say there's new evidence to examine, including newly released information from former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas who says there's no question the president wanted to convince Ukraine to investigate his potential Democratic presidential political opponent. 
""President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president,"" Parnas told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC.
From the Oval Office, President Trump again called the process partisan and denied Parnas' claims.
""Don't know where he comes from, know nothing about him. I can only tell you this thing is a big hoax,"" the president told reporters.
4 Republicans and 2 Democrats to Watch
A top priority of the House impeachment managers will be to convince moderate Republican senators to allow witnesses. The four senators to watch are Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Mitt Romney (R-UT), and Lamar Alexander (R-TN).
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Fox News he's concerned some of those Republican senators might try to allow the Democrats' witnesses to testify against Trump while blocking key witnesses who could testify on his behalf.
Two Democratic senators will also be key players. Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Doug Jones of Alabama represent states where Trump is popular and may vote in his favor in the end.
Despite Washington intrigue about the trial, the president is widely expected to be acquitted. That's because it takes a super-majority of seven senators to convict. That would require Democrats to convince 20 Republicans to vote against the president.

The president previewed his idea earlier this month at the Evangelicals for Trump rally at the King Jesus International Ministry in Florida, saying he would take action to safeguard students' and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in school.
""We will not allow faithful Americans to be bullied by the hard Left,"" Trump said.
The president told CBN News' David Brody at the White House Thursday, ""Well, it is a cultural war. You have two sides. You have a side that believes so strongly in prayer and they're being restricted and it's getting worse and worse and I think we've made a big impact. And we're loosening up a lot and I want to loosen it up totally. But you do have things happening today that 10 or 15 years ago would have been unthinkable, what's happening.""
Now the US Department of Education is sending letters to officials in all 50 states to ensure students and teachers don't face discrimination for practicing their right of religious freedom. 
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos explained the new rules protect students' right to pray, but they also go beyond that to protect faith-based student groups and much more: ""The Department's efforts will level the playing field between religious and non-religious organizations competing for federal grants, as well as protect First Amendment freedoms on campus and the religious liberty of faith-based institutions.""
White House Domestic Policy Director Joe Grogan said, ""We're going to be making it clear that students have the right to pray publicly in school if they so choose.""
Due to cases where the law has been misunderstood, today's announcement reinforces what's on the books. Grogan says it will ""remind the chief education officers in all 50 states that students have the right to pray at their own direction, to gather at their own direction, to bring the Bible to school if they choose to, to bring the Koran or the Torah in.""
The bottom line is this: Public schools now risk losing federal funds if they violate students' rights to religious expression.
The prayer announcement comes on Religious Freedom Day, an annual event held on January 16 to mark America's long history of protecting religious liberty going all the way back to the 1786 passage of Thomas Jefferson's Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom.
""A society without religion cannot prosper. A nation without faith cannot endure, because justice, goodness and peace cannot prevail without the glory of Almighty God,"" Trump said this month at his evangelical rally. ""For America to thrive in the 21st Century we must renew faith and family as the center of American life.""
""These angry radicals want to impose absolute conformity by censoring speech, tearing down crosses and symbols of faith and banning religious believers from public life,"" he said. ""But we will not back down, we are standing tall for the values that we hold dear.""
""I will be taking action to safeguard students' and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools,"" Trump said. ""They want to take that right along with many other rights.""
""My administration will never stop fighting for Americans of faith,"" he said. ""I really do believe we have God on our side.""
Franklin Graham tweeted, ""Thank you President Trump for protecting and empowering the right to student-led prayer in schools.""
Dr. David Jeremiah, pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church, praised the president's effort to defend the right to pray in school.
""President Trump has made the right decision to give America's children permission to pray again in our public schools. It's absurd that generations of our children, in our public schools, have been raised to think that there's little to no place for faith outside of one's church, one's home or one's heart. Our public schools ought to be places where people of faith feel free to be who they are, and -of course- no one really believes doing so constitutes enforcing one's personal faith on another. Our founding fathers would be utterly astonished that the one thing we thought wise was to deprive our children of their faith through America's education system. Can't we just agree that America is better off when people of faith pray, beginning with our children?""

Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said, ""For years, we've watched secularists pressure school administrators into telling students that they can't pray, read their Bibles, or talk about their faith in class. Some school officials are willing participants in the secularists' intimidation campaign while others fear the lack of funding to fight threatened lawsuits. Now the tables are turned. The onus is now on states to certify that they are compliant with U.S. Department of Education guidelines which protect students' religious freedom. If schools fail to protect religious freedom, they now run the risk of losing federal funding. With this and his other announced rules, President Trump is continuing the drumbeat of religious freedom and the long march toward restoring religious freedom in the public square.""
Rev. Johnnie Moore, a commissioner for the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, is applauding the move, saying it's just the latest proof that President Trump is a champion of religious freedom.
""The White House isn't saying whether one should pray or to whom or what they should pray to, they are simply making it clear that in the United States students have First Amendment rights also, and our 'separation of church and state' wasn't intended to suppress a vibrant religious life in America but to facilitate it. Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists, where he referenced this separation, was actually more about protecting the church from the State than the State from the church,"" Moore said.
He says he experienced a taste of the discrimination that other faith-filled students often experience in America's public schools.
""I found my personal faith in middle and high school as my family moved several times among multiple states and I attended multiple public schools. When I became passionate about my Christianity, I decided to start prayer meetings at each of my schools. I generally did so outside of school - before school - because these public schools, even in the Bible Belt, had a total paranoia about the separation of church and state which required us students to pray in the cold or rain, outside,"" Moore recalls.
""Even in those environments that were more open, the approval processes seemed intentionally burdensome. I was once called into a principal's office in one of my high schools for trying to have a Bible study during the lunch hour. It was totally absurd.""

Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, said, ""This is a decision that should be celebrated by Democrats and by Republicans, by the religious and the irreligious, by all Americans from sea to shining sea who recognize the brilliance of the American idea wasn't in a fear of religion but in the vibrancy of faith. Faith to believe that God exists or that he doesn't, faith to pray before we legislate or anchor our pledge and our currency in subservience to a higher power. Faith to sing the song of freedom as the arc of history bends toward justice. Our children need not fear faith, especially in our sacred institutions of learning."""

After the Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night, Sen. Elizabeth Warren accused Sen. Bernie Sanders of calling her a liar during a tense exchange where she refused to shake his outstretched hand.
The rift was clear on video, but their mics weren't on at the time. Now CNN, which co-hosted the debate, has released a recording from the moment that marred the evening.
Sen. Warren says to Sen. Sanders, ""I think you called me a liar on national TV... I think you called me a liar on national TV.""
Sanders replies, ""Alright, let's not do it now.""
During the debate, Sanders denied Warren's claim that he told her a woman couldn't win the White House during a one-on-one meeting in 2018.
Their dispute after the debate was the latest development in the accelerating rift between the two top progressive candidates. It has many activists on the Left worried that it could split their voters and drive many of them toward Joe Biden.
During the debate, Sen. Warren said she thinks a female candidate would actually have the best shot at winning the 2020 presidential election. ""Look at the men on this stage, collectively they have lost 10 elections,"" she said. ""The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women.""
But after the debate between the top six Democrat candidates, some progressives expressed their fear that they're not sure if any of the potential candidates can beat President Trump. Liberal commentators Al Sharpton and Van Jones both came out said exactly that.
""There was nothing I saw tonight that would be able to take Donald Trump out,"" Jones said.
Jones continued his dire warning about the current candidates tweeting, ""I had high expectations for the candidates during tonight's #DemDebate, but there was a spark missing on stage. It felt like cold oatmeal to me. Do you agree?""

On Thursday, Trump accuser Rep. Adam Schiff read the articles of impeachment aloud on the floor of the US Senate. The Democrats' impeachment effort now moves into a trial phase where they will try to prosecute the president while President Trump will finally get the chance to defend himself and present his case.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has named the House prosecutors who will handle the Senate impeachment trial against Trump - all her top cohorts in the effort to remove the president. They include Democrats Adam Schiff of California and Jerrold Nadler of New York, who both led the House impeachment probe.

President Trump has dismissed the impeachment effort during an event at the White House calling it a ""hoax"". Pelosi believes the impeachment vote by House Democrats on December 18th will stand because she claims there's even more evidence since then.
""Time has been our friend in all of this,"" Pelosi said. Over the weekend she gloated that no matter what happens next, President Trump has been ""impeached for life"" and it can never be undone.
Here Are the Charges
The impeachment charges against Trump include abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and it's all linked to claims he allegedly withheld funding from Ukraine to pressure them to investigate whether Joe Biden's son was given a job he wasn't qualified for as part of an Obama administration scheme. 
The newly appointed lead manager on impeachment, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff, said a fair trial demands the consideration of more evidence. That evidence could include newly released documents from an associate of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney.
What About Witnesses?
In regards to calling witnesses, Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun said: ""if we feel that we do not have enough information, I'm fine with it.""
Braun told CBN News that calling witnesses goes both ways, citing Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as a potential witness due to his son Hunter's role with Ukrainian gas company Burisma. ""How that can't be relevant to the discussion when there was corruption in Ukraine and are you immune from any kind of scrutiny because you're a potential political rival?"" asked Braun, in reference to former Vice President Biden. 
After months of closed-door meetings and public hearings, Republican senators see the trial on their side of the Hill as an opportunity to hear the rest of the story. ""There's a significant desire on our side for the President to be heard,"" said Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt.
During the mandatory trial, strict rules are in place on the Senate floor. Cell phones are prohibited and senators are restricted from talking amongst themselves. Senators on Capitol Hill have been told to prepare for six-hour sessions. 
President Trump's Reaction
The President wasted no time responding to Democrats Wednesday, taking to Twitter during Speaker Pelosi's announcement to call the trial ""another con job,"" exclaiming that ""all of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!""
Trump says the whole thing is a witch hunt and he was simply asking the Ukrainian president to make sure there wasn't corruption in the government's business before releasing US funding.

What many expected to be fiery, punch-filled evening turned out to be relatively tame, with all of the candidates seeming to put their best ""Midwest nice"" foot forward.
Elephant in the Room
One exception came when Elizabeth Warren addressed the elephant in the room: reports Bernie Sanders told her in 2018 that a woman couldn't win the election. 
""I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record,"" said the Massachusetts senator. ""Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women."" 
The socialist senator from Vermont defended himself by denying he ever made the comment. 
Iran and Iraq Foreign Policy Takes Center Stage
Amid growing tensions between the US and Iran, foreign policy dominated the evening.
Sanders hammered Joe Biden for his Iraq war vote. 
""I did everything I could to prevent that war,"" said Sanders. ""Joe saw it differently."" 
Biden responded by admitting what he now sees as a mistake. 
""I said, 13 years ago, it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war,"" said the former vice president. 
Other candidates took issue with President Trump's Iran policy. 
""We have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement,"" said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. ""As president, I will get us back into that agreement."" 
Billionaire Tom Steyer attacked Trump by saying he ""has no strategy."" 
Healthcare Disputes
On healthcare, Biden hit Sanders for not being ""candid with voters"" about the cost of his plan. ""I think we have to tell them what we're gonna do and what it's gonna cost,"" said Biden. 
And Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, pushed back on Warren's claim that his plan is too small. 
""We've got to move past Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate,"" said Buttigieg. 
Attention-Grabbing Moment
Perhaps the moment getting the most attention happened after the debate when Sanders appeared to offer to shake Warren's hand and she possibly rejected it. The two then got into what appeared to be a serious conversation. 
The Iowa Caucus is now less than three weeks away and the latest Des Moines Register poll shows Sanders at the top of the race with Biden, Warren and Buttigieg all close behind. 
Trump Responds
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump went after the Democratic candidates last night saying they can't protect America or your family.
Speaking at a rally in Wisconsin, he blasted the Democratic Party for its reaction to the strike he ordered, taking out Iranian terrorist mastermind General Qasem Soleimani.
""The Democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster. You know, many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms or without legs and without... were done by Soleimani. That's what he loved. He loved the roadside bomb. That's what he loved. Thousands and thousands and thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan. Roadside bombs. He was the king of the roadside bombs.""
Trump also said his administration supports the Iranian people's struggle for freedom from the Islamic regime."

That's also when Speaker Nancy Pelosi will move to appoint the House managers in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.
It's been nearly a month since the House approved charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress involving foreign interference in the 2020 election. 
The President is looking for an outright dismissal, a move that seems unlikely even in the Republican-led Senate. 
While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fought to call more witnesses, he's keeping the door open by following rules of President Clinton's Impeachment proceeding.
""If the existing case is strong, there's no need for the judge and the jury to reopen the investigation,"" said McConnell, speaking Tuesday on the Senate floor. 
With stances like that from some Senate Republicans, the 51 votes needed for a motion to dismiss are unlikely. 
""Every Senate impeachment trial in history has included witnesses,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
""You want precedent?"" Schumer asked on the Senate floor Tuesday. ""Precedent says witnesses,"" he said.  
The big fish would be John Bolton, whose willingness to testify could lead the president to exert executive privilege to limit his former national security adviser as a witness. 
Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said the Senate will debate whether to call witnesses after the House managers make their case. 
""I feel very confident he'll be acquitted in the end,"" added Graham, in regards to the President. 
Before his own acquittal in 1999, when he told Americans in a Rose Garden address ""how profoundly sorry I am,"" President Clinton faced 13 impeachment managers during his Senate trial. 
""I believe that the impeachment managers set the tone,"" said Rep. Judy Chu, a Democrat from California. 
Met with cheers at Monday's college football championship in Louisiana, President Trump has said he doesn't feel like he's being impeached. 
Sen. Graham said to the President at the game, ""there's a process, once we start we're going to try to plow ahead and get it done, and hopefully by the time of the State of the Union.""
There are some procedural steps ahead of an impeachment trial in the Senate, including the swearing-in of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and all senators, and debate on a resolution on the trial guidelines. 
Leader McConnell said the third Senate trial of an American president could begin next Tuesday."

Cory Booker has become the latest to drop out of the race. He couldn't muster enough financial support or grab enough attention to bring up his meager poll numbers.
Only half of the 12 remaining candidates will be allowed to take the debate stage in Iowa at 9 p.m. Tuesday night. They needed to prove top-tier status to qualify, and that included 225,000 unique donors and higher poll numbers.
It's their final debate before the Iowa caucuses officially kick off the Democratic voting on February 3. Of the six candidates on the stage, four will be men and two will be women:

Businessman Andrew Yang didn't make the stage due to low poll numbers, and billionaire Michael Bloomberg didn't qualify because he's mainly been funding his campaign with his own money and didn't have enough donors.
Meanwhile, polls show a tight and potentially shifting race for these 2020 presidential hopefuls. A new Monmouth poll shows Joe Biden in the lead once again with 24 percent of Iowa caucusgoers supporting him.
That poll shows Sanders with 18 percent support, Buttigieg with 17 percent, and Warren with 15 percent.

But a Des Moines Register poll shows socialist Sanders ahead in the state. Many Democratic insiders are growing concerned that Sanders could possibly win the party's nomination, and they worry that the socialist candidate would alienate the swing voters they need to help them beat President Trump in November.
The debate also comes amid a controversy about Sanders supposedly telling his fellow progressive Sen. Warren that he didn't believe a woman could win the election. He denies it, but she's confirmed it.

It is still not clear what day this week that will happen, but Pelosi will meet with her caucus Tuesday morning to discuss moving forward and is preparing the House for a vote early this week. 
The Senate will begin their trial almost immediately after receiving the articles. 
""There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure,"" Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said last week.
McConnell stood strong throughout the standoff with Pelosi, refusing her demands to promise witnesses in a Senate trial.
""The senators who are thinking now about voting for witnesses or not, they will have to be accountable for not having a fair trial,"" Pelosi told ABC's 'This Week'. 
While McConnell and other top Senate Republicans hope to end the trial quickly, they will take a vote on witnesses after the trial begins.
""Obviously, that is the most contentious part of one of these proceedings, and that'll be addressed at that time and not before the trial begins,"" McConnell told reporters.
According to a new Politico/Morning Consult poll, 57% of all voters would prefer witnesses called forward.   
""Whoever heard of a trial without witnesses and documents? it's unprecedented,"" asked Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
All eyes will be on GOP senators seen as vulnerable for reelection this year like Susan Collins, Martha McSally, Cory Gardner, and Thom Tillis. Schumer believes they might have a hard time voting with McConnell. 
""Many of his colleagues are very, very worried about going home and saying they are not for witnesses and documents,"" Schumer claims.
Speaker Pelosi says if the Senate doesn't have witnesses, the House could still call forth Ambassador John Bolton, who says he will testify in the Senate if subpoenaed. "

His departure now leaves a field that was once the most diverse in history with just one remaining African American candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick.
 
Since launching his campaign last February, Booker, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, struggled to raise the type of money required to support a White House bid. He was at the back of the pack in most surveys and failed to meet the polling requirements needed to participate in Tuesday's debate. Booker also missed last month's debate and exits the race polling in low single digits in the early primary states and nationwide.
 
In an email to supporters, Booker said that he “got into this race to win” and that his failure to make the debates prevented him from raising the money required for victory.
 
""Our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win -- money we don’t have, and money that is harder to raise because I won’t be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in Washington,"" he said.
 
Booker had warned that the looming impeachment trial of President Donald Trump would deal a “big, big blow” to his campaign by pulling him away from Iowa in the final weeks before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. He hinted at the challenges facing his campaign last week in an interview on The Associated Press' “Ground Game” podcast.
 
“If we can’t raise more money in this final stretch, we won’t be able to do the things that other campaigns with more money can do to show presence,"" he said.
 
In his email to supporters, Booker pledged to do “everything in my power to elect the eventual Democratic nominee for president,"" though his campaign says he has no immediate plans to endorse a candidate in the primary.
 
It’s a humbling finish for someone who was once lauded by Oprah Winfrey as the “rock star mayor” who helped lead the renewal of Newark, New Jersey. During his seven years in City Hall, Booker was known for his headline-grabbing feats of local do-goodery, including running into a burning building to save a woman, and his early fluency with social media, which brought him 1.4 million followers on Twitter when the platform was little used in politics. His rhetorical skills and Ivy League background often brought comparisons to President Barack Obama, and he'd been discussed as a potential presidential contender since his arrival in the Senate in 2013.
 
Now, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has mastered the art of the selfie on social media. Another former mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is seen as the freshest face in the field. And Booker’s message of hope and love seemed to fall flat during an era characterized perhaps most strongly by Democratic fury over the actions of the Trump administration.
 
An early focus on building out a strong and seasoned campaign operation in Iowa and South Carolina may have hampered his campaign in the long run, as the resources he spent early on staff there left him working with a tight budget in the later stages of the primary, when many of his opponents were going on air with television ads. That meant that even later in the campaign, after he had collected some of the top endorsements in Iowa and visited South Carolina almost more than any other candidate, a significant portion of the electorate in both states either said they were unfamiliar with his campaign or viewed him unfavorably.
 
On the stump, Booker emphasized his Midwestern connections - often referencing the nearly 80 family members he has still living in Iowa when he campaigned there - and delivered an exhortation to voters to use “radical love” to overcome what he considered Trump's hate. But he rarely drew a contrast with his opponents on the trail, even when asked directly, and even some of Booker's supporters worried his message on Trump wasn't sharp enough to go up against a Republican president known for dragging his opponents into the mud.
 
Booker struggled to land on a message that would resonate with voters. He's long been seen as a progressive Democrat in the Senate, pushing for criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. And on the campaign trail, he proposed establishing a $1,000 savings account for every child born in the U.S. to help close the racial wealth gap.
 
He was among the first candidates to release a gun control plan, and at the time it was the most ambitious in the field, as it included a gun licensing program that would have been seen as political suicide just a decade before. He also released an early criminal justice reform plan that focused heavily on addressing sentencing disparities for drug crimes.
 
But he also sought to frame himself as an uplifting, unifying figure who emphasized his bipartisan work record. That didn't land in a Democratic primary that has often rewarded candidates who promised voters they were tough-minded fighters who could take on Trump.
 
Booker's seat is up for a vote this year, and he will run for reelection to the Senate. A handful of candidates has launched campaigns for the seat, but Booker is expected to have an easy path to reelection.
   
Booker’s exit from the presidential race further narrows the once two dozen-strong field, which now stands at 12 candidates.

Now a new political firestorm will kick off in the Senate as Republicans seek to reject the House's impeachment vote. The first shots in this new round were fired Sunday as President Donald Trump and Speaker Pelosi squared off ahead over the upcoming Senate impeachment trial.
""The president is impeached for life, regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,"" Pelosi argued. ""There is nothing the Senate can do to ever erase that.""
On ABC's ""This Week"" she also declared, ""Let's be optimistic about the future, a future that will not have Donald Trump in the White House, one way or another. Ten months from now we will have an election if we will not have him removed sooner. But again, he will be impeached forever.""
Pelosi said today:
– Trump won't be president next year ""one way or another""
– Dems may ""have him removed sooner"" than the election
– Trump ""will be impeached forever""

House Republican Whip Steve Scalise blasted Pelosi's gleeful claims, tweeting, ""It's clear: Impeachment was a Democrat hit job to stain Trump's legacy and hurt him at the polls. Nothing more.""
Rep. Fred Keller also said Pelosi's comments reveal that her agenda ""has been only about one thing: impeaching a duly-elected President without facts and without evidence. Her quest to cancel 63 million votes and influence this year's election has been a total sham and a needless, divisive farce.""
Meanwhile, Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani says the Senate can clear the president's name by simply dismissing the charges. Trump agrees the case should be dismissed, but Pelosi says that would be a coverup.
Trump tweeted, ""Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!”
Pelosi is finally acquiescing to send the two articles of impeachment to the Senate after failing to get Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to go along with her demands. McConnell stood firm stating, ""There will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure.""
Democratic senators had even begun pressuring Pelosi last week to send the articles to the Senate. That came after critics pointed out that House Democrats had argued they needed to urgently pass impeachment articles before Christmas but then held onto them for several weeks, refusing to deliver them to the Senate.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and others have already rejected the House impeachment effort, predicting the Senate trial would end ”in a matter of days″ with a fast acquittal.

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is preparing his Republican caucus for the trial, telling members to prepare for six-day work weeks and to stay in Washington next weekend.
McConnell claims the Senate will not make a decision whether to call witnesses until after phase one of the trial when they hear arguments from the prosecution and defense.
""Obviously, that is the most contentious part of one of these proceedings, and that'll be addressed at that time and not before the trial begin,"" McConnell told reporters this week.
McConnell and other top Senate Republicans hope to end the trial quickly without witnesses.
""I think our job is to pass judgment on the articles that they have sent over to us. That's the role that we have constitutionally in the Senate,"" said Sen. John Thune (R-SD), a member of GOP leadership. 
But GOP senators like Mitt Romney (R-UT) may prevent moving directly to a vote on the articles without hearing from witnesses first. 
""At this stage, I'd like to hear from John Bolton and other witnesses with the direct information,"" Romney told reporters.
McConnell will need 51 votes to call witnesses or move directly to a vote. Senate Democrats have made it very clear they want witnesses.
""The four witnesses we've asked to testify should testify,"" argued Sen. Michael Bennet, (D-CO).
""I have never seen a trial without a witness,"" claimed Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ).

Hours later Congress was briefed on the situation and now some lawmakers are trying to limit the president's war powers should Iran strike again.
The House of Representatives passed a measure to do that on Thursday.
It comes as new video shows Iran's missile attack targeting US troops at two bases in Iraq Tuesday, and new satellite images reveal the extensive damage.

The chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff General Mark Milley told reporters the missiles were meant ""to kill personnel."" Fortunately though, no American or coalition forces died. Trump says it's proof that the US military's early warning system worked and that Iran may be de-escalating now.
In his Wednesday address, Trump called for new sanctions against the regime.
""We do not want to use (the military),"" said Trump. ""American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.""
On Capitol Hill Wednesday, it was a duel of words between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) over the president's decision to target Iran's General Qasem Soleimani and attempts to limit the president's ability to respond to future attacks from Iran.
""For our part, I certainly hope our own congressional delegations do not give Tehran a reason to question our national will,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor.
Schumer responded by criticizing Trump's leadership. ""I'm afraid that these impulsive and erratic actions, throughout the world, are making us less safe,"" he said.
Senators briefed by the administration's national security team came out of the meeting with mixed reaction.
""It was very well done,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) told reporters. ""I think they've done an excellent job of outlining the rationale behind both the decision to go after Soleimani and the response to the Iranian attack.""
Democrats though, and even some other Republicans, disagreed. ""It is a far cry from meeting a standard of imminent threat,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA).
Republican Sen. Mike Lee (UT) called it ""the worst briefing"" he'd seen on a military issue in his nine-year Senate tenure. He and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) both vowed to vote with Democrats to limit the president's war powers.
But Thursday morning, Vice President Mike Pence told Fox News that the intelligence was solid. ""The leadership in Congress in the House and Senate has seen this intelligence, and frankly the most compelling intelligence to support the fact that there was an imminent attack being developed by Qasem Soleimani was is freankly too sensitive to share broadly, it woud compromise what we call sources and methods.""
The Senate will vote next week.
Meanwhile, the House passed its resolution Thursday, making it clear that if the president wants to go to war, he must first get the approval of Congress.
Iran says their attack is the end of it, but analysts believe there are more on the way, including possible cyber attacks, and they've issued a warning to law enforcement agencies throughout the country."

While many Republicans are praising the president for finally taking action.
""He (Soleimani) is a nasty, nasty person and is a real threat to our national security,"" said Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS)
Sen. James Lankford  (R-OK) argued after months of Iranian aggression toward the US - it was time to act. 
""The restraint that the President has had over and over again. That they take down one of our drones and then they launch rockets at us a dozen times over two months. And the President has not responded he has waited and said if an American is injured or killed we are going to respond in a very strong way,"" Lankford said. ""He's done that now and I think that's consistent with our policies.""
But Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) believes Trump should have cleared the attack with Congress.
""In our country, it was supposed to be that we wouldn't send people into harm's way unless there was a political consensus, represented by a congressional vote that war was in the national interest and that's what I'm trying to force Congress to grapple with,"" he said. 
Kaine introduced a war powers resolution to prevent President Trump from further escalating the situation with Iran without congressional approval.
""All he's doing is escalating tensions and he seems to believe 'I can strike you, but you can't strike me,'"" Kaine said. 
While Republicans like Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY) are considering to support Kaine's resolution or similar legislation, Lankford argues it is not needed because we are not at war with Iran or trying to start a war. "

","Let's get on with it! That's the attitude from President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who say they're ready for the impeachment trial. So, what are the Democrats waiting for?
McConnell announced Tuesday night he's ready to begin the trial without an agreement with Democrats over witnesses.
Democrats have been pushing for additional witnesses, but McConnell says he wants to defer that decision until later in the trial. That's similar to the process in President Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999.  
Now, McConnell has the votes to carry out that plan. The trial can't begin, though, until House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sends the impeachment articles to the Senate.
McConnell said, ""Nearly three weeks after the rushed vote they claimed was so urgent, they are still debating whether or not they want to see the trial proceed."" He blasted Democrats for playing ""one cynical political game right on top of another.""
Pelosi reportedly told fellow Democrats Tuesday night that she's not ready to send the articles until she sees specific rules for trial procedures.
Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said Democrats aren't cooperating with Republicans to move the process forward. 
""Right now they seem to be intent on playing political games with this but if the House will send it over.  And Senator Schumer will agree to sit down with Senator McConnell, we can work out a path forward and we'll see where that leads,"" Thune said.

McConnell (R-KY) now has enough votes to stop Democrat demands to require additional witnesses to testify at the beginning of President Trump's impeachment trial, according to The Hill.
Two moderate GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are backing McConnell’s plan to defer a decision to call witnesses in the Senate trial.
This comes as Trump's former National Security Adviser John Bolton announced he will testify if called. Bolton issued a statement saying, ""If the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify.""
It takes a majority vote to call witnesses, and since the GOP has a 53 seat majority, McConnell has the upper hand in deciding whether to call Bolton and others.
""The House may have been content to scrap their own norms to hurt President Trump, but that is not the Senate,"" McConnell said.
He says the Senate should follow the precedent of the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial. That means waiting until later in the process to take up the question of calling additional witnesses.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says the Senate should agree now to call witnesses.
 
""If any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we've requested, they would make it absolutely clear they are participating in a cover-up,"" Schumer said.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still hasn't delivered the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
On Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News that the Republican-controlled Senate should change the rules to override Pelosi.
Graham said, ""Well, we're not going to let Nancy Pelosi use the rules of the Senate to her advantage. This is dangerous for the presidency as an institution.""    
     
President Trump tweeted this week, ""The impeachment hoax, just a continuation of the witch hunt which started even before I won the election, must end quickly - get this done."""

Wade,"More than 200 members of Congress have signed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the US Supreme Court to reconsider the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide.  
According to The New York Times, 39 senators and 166 House members - all Republicans except for two Democrats signed the brief to support a Louisiana law in a case called June Medical Services L.L.C. v. Gee.  In their brief, they also asked the justices to reconsider Roe and another landmark abortion ruling that followed it in 1992, Planned Parenthood v. Casey.  
The brief supports a law passed in Louisiana in 2014, but that has not taken effect due to legal challenges that have finally landed it before the high court.  The law states physicians performing abortions at clinics must have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, a requirement the law's supporters say is intended to help guarantee the competency of doctors, and to protect the health and safety of mothers seeking an abortion.
Opponents of the law say its real purpose is to limit access to abortion, which they say it severely does. The New York Times reports that only one abortion doctor in Louisiana has been able to meet the admitting privileges requirement. Democrat lawmakers in Congress have filed a brief in the case as well, opposing the Louisiana law.
The Louisiana law is the first dealing with abortion to come before the Supreme Court since Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both nominated by President Trump, were seated on the court. This amicus brief filed mostly by Republicans in Congress is the first to directly challenge the precedent of Roe v. Wade and other decisions that followed and based their conclusions on Roe. 
When Roe v. Wade was handed down by the Supreme Court in 1973 it was criticized as the epitome of judicial activism, with justices seen as ""legislating from the bench,"" and actively creating a national law that torpedoed abortion laws actually passed by legislatures across the country. The result has made abortion the most contentious social issue and political hot potato since the court ruled in the infamous Dred Scott decision that black people were never intended to be citizens of the United States, and supported laws saying they could not be counted as full persons. 
The brief, signed by 207 mostly Republican lawmakers, goes after Roe, saying that ""Forty-six years after Roe was decided, it remains a radically unsettled precedent,"" and noted the ""unworkability"" of the ""right to abortion"" found in Roe v. Wade and decisions based on it that followed.
But Katie Glenn, an attorney for Americans United For Life, the pro-life group that drafted the brief, told the Times she has no illusions that this Louisiana case will be the final blow to the much-disputed Roe.    
""No one is going into this case with an expectation that Roe v. Wade will be overturned,"" Glenn said. ""However, the court has the opportunity to reconsider the precedent that has gotten us to where we're at, and that's all that the members of Congress were seeking to point out, that it is the court's prerogative to assess the jurisprudence that got us here.""
That includes the reconsideration of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the right to abortion but said that states could restrict it as long as they didn't impose an ""undue burden"" on it.  Opponents of the Louisiana law will argue that it does hit that ""undue burden"" standard and that it should be overturned. A similar Texas law was struck down in 2016, based on that standard. 
But the amicus brief criticizes Casey's ""undue burden"" criteria as ""vague"" and ""opaque"" making it difficult for judges in Louisiana and elsewhere to know what it really means. 
The court will hear oral arguments in the Louisiana law case in March. A ruling is expected in June. 
However, the court rules, expect abortion to remain the hot button issue of our time that just won't go away. Namely, because it deals with the issue of life and death, and secondly, largely because of how the high court discovered a ""right to abortion"" in the first place. "

After a group prayer, the President was introduced to the audience by Paula White.
While the audience cheered, Trump stood behind the pulpit and warned terrorists not to challenge the United States.  
Referencing Thursday's attack against Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Trump said: “So let this be a warning to terrorists, if you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of American citizens.""
The President called the operation that killed Soleimani ""a flawless strike.""
“Qassem Soleimani has been killed and his bloody rampage is now, forever gone,"" Trump told the cheering audience. “He was plotting attacks on Americans, but we’ve now insured his atrocities have been stopped for good.""
The President also took a moment to remind Iran that the US does not want war. 
“We do not seek war,"" he said. ""We do not seek nation-building. We do not seek regime change.”
Touting the accomplishments made during his administration, Trump reminded the audience that faith and family need to be at the center of American life.
""For America to thrive in the 21st century, we must renew faith and family as the center of American life,"" he said. 
Trump also pointed to his efforts for religious liberty both in the US and around the world. “We’re defending religion itself. A society without religion cannot prosper. A nation without faith can not endure,” said Trump. “We can’t let one of our radical left friends come in here because everything we’ve done will be gone in short order.”
“The day I was sworn in, the federal government's war on religion came to an abrupt end,” Trump declared. He later added, “We can smile because we’re winning by so much.”
The President also condemned anti-Semitism, mentioning the recent attacks on Jews in New York. He also said that his administration would continue to stand up for Israel.

Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, called Trump's campaign kickoff ""politically brilliant.""
""It is not only logical but—arguably—politically brilliant that the president will kick off 2020 with the launch of his reelection's evangelical outreach at a Latino megachurch in the state of Florida,"" he said. 
According to exit polls, 29 to 30 percent of Latinos voted for President Trump in 2016. 
""The driving forces behind that Hispanic support may this time garner even greater support: faith values and economic opportunity. Latino evangelicals represent a constituency that is pro-life, supportive of religious liberty, and focused on biblical justice,"" Rodriguez said.
He believes many Latino Christians are unlikely to support politicians who promote socialism, arguing that it was ""a socialistic worldview that destroyed Venezuela and Cuba and serves as the primary conduit for economic and civil rights oppression in Latin America.""
Not all evangelicals are in Trump's camp. Last month, a Christianity Today op-ed argued President Trump ""should be removed"" from office. The magazine got backlash from the evangelical publication's founder's son – Franklin Graham.
Trump received more than 80% of the evangelical support in 2016 and hopes to build on that number as he gets closer to 2020. A number of Christian leaders are weighing in on the event, saying many evangelical voters are still firmly supporting Trump.
Pastor Jack Graham of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Dallas, TX, said, ""As evangelicals, we are enthusiastically supportive of our President and his policies. The rally is an opportunity for us to recommit to the continuation of his presidency and the promise of America's best values.""
And Rev. Johnnie Moore tells CBN News, ""Every indication is that President Trump will ride an evangelical wave right back into the Oval Office in 2020, but this time the coalition will be even larger and even more diverse. He ran in 2016 as a promise maker but in 2020 he's running as a promise keeper; having not just met but exceeded the expectations of his constituents."" 
The Miami rally comes after the Trump campaign reported it raised $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, far ahead of any Democratic candidate.
A new Associated Press poll shows big support for President Trump among white evangelicals who are also distinct on abortion.
They spoke to 1,000 American adults from various faith backgrounds and found 67% of white evangelical protestants support making abortion illegal except in cases of rape, incest or threats to a mother's life. 
That's compared to 45% of Catholics and 37% of all Americans."

Right now, the big question is when or even if the Senate will receive the articles of impeachment from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who is hanging onto the articles at the moment. 
The hold-up is she wants to see how the Senate plans to proceed with the trial's rules, but President Trump says it's because Democrats don't have a case against him.

Pelosi pushed back in a letter to House Democrats writing ""it now remains for the Senate to present the rules under which we will proceed.""
This was in response to news that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged total coordination with the White House.
A move that was even criticized by some Republican lawmakers. 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said: ""there should be distance between the white house and senate over the impeachment proceedings.""
""It is inappropriate in my judgment for senators on either side of the aisle to prejudge the evidence,"" said Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME).
This, as the president's lawyer, said he is willing to testify and would ""love to try the case.""
""I would testify. I would do demonstrations. I'd give lectures. I'd give summations or I do what I do best,"" said Rudy Giuliani.
A key question is will the trial include witnesses? Democrats have been pushing to hear from White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Advisor John Bolton. 
McConnell needs to get 51 of the 53 Senate Republicans to vote his way which would allow the GOP to control the process and call who they want. "

Mayor Pete Buttigieg also had a strong quarter, raising almost $25 million. Buttigieg now has a campaign staff of 500 people nationwide.
And Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced she had raised $21.2 million in the final quarter.
But former Vice President Joe Biden remains the Democratic Party's front-runner in the polls.

That puts him well ahead of Sanders at 19 percent, Warren at 15 percent, Buttigieg at eight, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg with just under five percent.
Meanwhile, Julian Castro has just dropped out of the race as the large Democratic field of candidates shrinks once again. Castro was Obama's Housing and Urban Development secretary and a former San Antonio mayor, but he struggled to gain enough support and donations.

NY, CA Losing Population, May Also Lose Congressional Seats","Even though the national economy is humming along nicely, the liberal states of New York and California are poised to lose congressional seats due to an ongoing exodus according to US Census Bureau population estimates released this week.
The Empire State and the Golden State are among 27 states and the District of Columbia which have lost residents due to domestic migration over the last two years.
New York was one of only 10 states to suffer a total population decline in 2018-19 — its fourth consecutive annual decrease after five years of growth, and the largest population drop of any state, the census data determined. 
""You'd think with a strong economy, New York wouldn't be losing population,"" the Empire Center's E.J. McMahon, author of the report, told The New York Post. 
New York's population has been stagnant over the past decade, with a modest 75,459 increase in residents since 2010, a growth rate of just 0.4 percent, ranking 46th-lowest out of 50 states, according to the newspaper. 
This stagnation will likely result in the loss of one or two congressional seats in the coming years. 
Staten Island Republican Councilman Joe Borelli said immigrants, as well as New York natives, are exiting or bypassing New York because it's become unaffordable.
""The cost of living in New York — the high taxes, regulations, and housing costs — are making it untenable to live the American dream here,"" Borelli told the newspaper, noting how many high school friends have moved out of New York.
All That Glitters Isn't Gold
Likewise, California's population growth has also continued to slow. So much in fact that for the first time in the state's history it may also lose a congressional seat.
The Los Angeles Times reported the state's economic woes are making it harder for people to make a living, so they're leaving.  
William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told the newspaper the Golden State's population migration could result in the loss of a seat in the US House of Representatives.  California currently has 53 seats in the House. 
""It's got a lot to do with dispersion from California to the rest of the west,"" Frey said. ""Arizona, Texas, and Colorado are all big destinations for California migrants, and they all are gaining seats.""
Texas may gain three seats after the 2020 decennial count, according to Frey's analysis of census data, while states such as Arizona, Colorado, and Oregon may gain one seat apiece.
The apportionment population count for each of the 50 states includes the state's total resident population — citizens and non-citizens — as well as a count of the overseas federal employees and their dependents who have that state listed as their home state in their employers' administrative records, according to the US Census Bureau."

The measure would have required houses of worship and other nonprofits to pay a 21 percent tax on employee benefits such as parking spaces and transit subsidies, according to the website CatholicPhilly.com.
The repeal was a part of appropriations bills for the new year, passed by both the House and Senate. The bill requiring the repeal was sponsored by Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. (D-NJ).  Since the bill is retroactive, the IRS will provide instructions on how churches can claim a refund on taxes they paid for the last two years because of the ""parking lot tax.""
Churches and evangelical leaders praised the government's action.

'Blasphemous, Vulgar, and Disrespectful': Netflix Brazil's 'Gay Jesus' Film Sparks Religious Outcry
'My Father Would Have Been Disappointed': Franklin Graham Fires Back at Christianity Today's 'Elitist Liberal' Call for Trump's Removal
The concept of a supposedly conservative or Christian institution being co-opted to promote the views of the progressive left is not new. The past century in American politics and religion has been littered with fitting examples. Great industrialists such as Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and others left “non-partisan” foundations to carry on their legacy. Though hardly liberals themselves, their fortunes now fund almost exclusively left-wing causes. Mainline protestant churches that were once known as “the Republican Party at prayer” have become some of the strongest voices pushing gay marriage and radical gender ideology.
Whenever possible, liberals exploit the leftward shift of those who run these organizations in order to weaponize the reputations those organizations have built up among conservatives. Articles purporting to present “the conservative case” or “the evangelical case” for policies that are almost universally reviled among conservatives appear to carry far more weight when they’re associated with a brand that has credibility on the right.
Christianity Today’s invocation of the great Billy Graham’s name to attack the President is merely the latest example of this well-worn strategy. It’s also one of the most transparently dishonest.
The Rev. Graham didn’t start Christianity Today as an explicitly right-wing institution. In fact, he didn’t start it to be a political rag of any variety, conservative or otherwise. His only objective was to promote the orthodox word of Christ. That was Billy Graham’s way. During the civil rights movement, he and my uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., didn’t necessarily see eye to eye on every political issue of the day, but they were able to preach together because they shared an abiding faith in the power of Christ and the indispensability of spreading the Gospel when it came to addressing the myriad injustices of the time.
Now, 53 years after the publication’s first issue and less than two years after Graham’s death, Christianity Today is being used to shill for political causes that run directly opposite to his own stated beliefs. Graham’s son, Franklin — himself a leading evangelical minister — responded immediately and forcefully to Christianity Today’s attempt to co-opt his father’s legacy on behalf of the Democratic Party’s political ends.
“My father knew Donald Trump, he believed in Donald Trump, and he voted for Donald Trump,” Franklin wrote in a scathing Facebook post. “For Christianity Today to side with the Democrat Party in a totally partisan attack on the President of the United States is unfathomable.”
Worse still, Christianity Today’s slide to the left is not just an affront to its founder, but also an abandonment of some of the key Christian doctrines it was created to uphold. In the First Epistle of Paul to Timothy, St. Paul urges the faithful to pray “For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.”
Whatever one’s politics, the usurpation of civil authority on grounds as flimsy and partisan as the articles of impeachment cooked up by Jerry Nadler and Nancy Pelosi runs counter to all principles of the Christian’s proper role in relation to politics. President Trump, far from being a “morally lost” leader in need of removal as the editorial argues, has returned Christian morality and respect for religious liberty to the very center of American political life.
In the spirit of Christian forgiveness, he has returned thousands of reformed offenders — the overwhelming majority of them African-American — to their families. In the spirit of Christian charity, he has fought to keep struggling Historically Black Colleges and Universities in operation by increasing federal assistance. And in the spirit of Christian faithfulness, he has protected the faithful everywhere from government intrusions that would force them to violate the core tenets of their religion.
There’s never been a more critical time for such a leader, given the rapid decline of civility and respect in our society. It’s a chilling indication of the times we live in that Netflix is marking the Christmas season by airing a disgusting, sacrilegious “comedy” special that depicts Jesus Christ as a homosexual.
As one who has experienced both happiness and sadness during past holiday seasons, though, I can offer my steadfast assurance that God’s love is always real. Every year, come what may, my family and I try to approach the season with love and forgiveness in our hearts. Some years are better than others, but the effort is always worth it.
Whatever your personal situation might be this Christmas, I encourage you to do your best to avoid the grinchy pitfalls and focus on what’s really important. If you can do that, I promise that it’s still possible to have a merry and blessed Christmas!

The latest face-off came one day after the historic vote in the House to impeach President Trump, a subject addressed right out of the gate.
""We've now seen the impact of corruption and that's what's clearly on the stage in 2020. Is how are we going to run against the most corrupt president in living history,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
""What conservatives, I think, understand is that we cannot have a President with that temperament who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) chimed in.
""My job is just to go out and make the case why he doesn't deserve to be president of the United States for another four years,"" explained Joe Biden.
With the timing of the PBS News Hour/Politico debate just weeks before the Iowa caucuses candidates appeared to distinguish themselves and diminish their opponents.
""The mayor just had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900 a bottle wine. Um, think about who comes to that,"" said Sen. Warren referring to Mayor Pete Buttigieg. ""Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president,"" she continued.
""According to Forbes Magazine, I'm literally the only person on this stage who's not a millionaire or a billionaire. This is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass,"" Mayor Buttigieg fired back.
Biden went after Sander's plan to put all Americans on Medicare.
""Sixteen percent of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now. Tell me you're gonna add 84 percent more and there's not gonna be higher taxes. At least before he was honest about it. It's gonna increase personal taxes,"" Biden roared.
""That's right we are gonna increase personal taxes but we're eliminating premiums, we're eliminating co-payments, we're eliminating deductibles, we're eliminating all out of pocket expenses,"" Sanders responded.
Sanders, a Jew who lived in Israel as a child, called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""racist"" and criticized US policy towards the Jewish State.
""But what US foreign policy must be about is not just pro-Israel. We must be pro-Palestinian as well,"" Sanders said waving his hands as he spoke.
Midwesterners Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) painted themselves as sensible progressives. 
""I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time,"" Klobuchar explained.
Speaking in Singapore this week President Obama said the world would be a better place if more women were in charge and suggested many of the world's problems stem from ""old people, usually old men, not getting out of the way.""
Debate moderator and chief political correspondent for Politico Tim Alberta asked Biden, ""I'm going to guess that President Obama did not clear that comment through your campaign ahead of time.""
 
""And I'm gonna guess he wasn't talking about me either,"" Biden said with a smile to applause from the audience. ""Look, I'm running because I've been around...and with experience hopefully comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom.""
Amid new reporting critical of Obama's handling of the War in Afghanistan Biden firmly diverged from his former boss.
""I'm the guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan. period. We should not have done it,"" Biden said.
The former vice president remains the front runner. If elected he would be 82 years old at the end of his first term and was asked if he's committed to seeking a second term.
 
""No, I'm not willing to commit one way or another. Here's the deal - I'm not even elected one term yet and let's see where we are. Let's see what happens,"" he said to applause.
Candidates Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer were passionate about climate change. 
""We should obviously be paying to relocate Americans away from places that are hit by climate change,"" Yang said. ""Part of my plan is literally called 'move people to higher ground,'"" he explained.
""We actually have the technology that we need. It's called wind, and solar, and batteries,"" said Steyer.
And in this season of Christmas candidates were asked to either seek forgiveness or offer a gift.
""We have to bring people with us and now shut them out that is the gift we can give America in this election,"" Klobuchar said.
Democrats will debate four more times between now and the end of February.
All of the face-offs are located in early voting states.

0,2019-12-19T16:30:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/december/democratic-led-house-gives-trump-big-win-on-trade,"After Impeachment, House Bestows Big Trade Victory on Trump","WASHINGTON (AP) — One day after its historic impeachment votes, the Democratic-led House gave President Donald Trump an overwhelming bipartisan victory Thursday on a renegotiated trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.
By a 385-41 vote, the House approved a bill that puts in place terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
The legislation passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her colleagues won key concessions from an administration anxious to pass the trade deal before next year’s election season makes that task more difficult.
The deal is projected to have only a modest impact on the economy. But it gives lawmakers from both parties the chance to support an agreement sought by farmers, ranchers and business owners anxious to move past the months of trade tensions that have complicated spending and hiring decisions.
The GOP-controlled Senate probably will take up the legislation when members return to Washington after the holidays and after dealing with impeachment.
Trump made tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement a hallmark of his presidential run in 2016 as he tried to win over working-class voters in states such as Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.
“Critics said it couldn’t be done, but he made it happen. Another promise made, another promise kept,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.
Some said the agreement did not do enough to prevent U.S. jobs from relocating to Mexico, but it won praise from Democrats who have routinely voted against prior trade agreements.
“Twenty-six years ago, I opposed NAFTA with every bone in my body,” said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. “I never thought the day would come when we would have the opportunity to right some of the wrongs in that agreement.”
Pelosi said the agreement was “light years” ahead of what the administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico. “We knew we could do better,” Pelosi said.
The original NAFTA phased out nearly all tariffs on goods produced and traded within North America. It was extraordinary because it linked two wealthy, developed countries with a poor, developing country. Since then, trade with Canada and Mexico has increased more rapidly than trade with most other countries.
Democrats for years have charged that NAFTA led to massive losses of high-paying manufacturing jobs in the U.S. as companies moved production to low-wage Mexico. Trump distinguished himself from free-trade Republicans in the presidential primary with his NAFTA-bashing rhetoric, and his administration got Canada and Mexico to negotiate a rewrite.
The International Trade Commission projected in April that the agreement would boost the economy by $68 billion and add 176,000 jobs six years after taking effect.
Some of the biggest impacts would be felt in the U.S. automotive industry. The agreement aims to see more cars produced where workers earn an average of at least $16 an hour.
The commission found that the new agreement would create 30,000 jobs in American auto parts plants. On the down side, the commission found the pact would increase the cost of pickup trucks and cars. That would hurt demand and reduce the number of jobs in factories that assemble cars by about 1,500.
Business and farm groups had been hitting the airwaves and the halls of Congress to get lawmakers to support the pact, putting pressure on Democrats to work with the administration even as labor unions remained wary that the new deal represented much of an improvement from NAFTA.
Trump, at times, seemed resigned to the assessment that the two sides would never reach a compromise. “She’s incapable of moving it,” Trump said a few weeks ago about Pelosi.
Behind the scenes, Trump’s lead negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, was working with House Democrats on changes to address their concerns. The agreement includes a process that could lead to inspections of factories and facilities in Mexico that are not living up to labor obligations.
It also secures more than $600 million for environmental problems in the NAFTA region. It scrapped giving pharmaceutical companies 10 years’ protection from cheaper competition in a category of ultra-expensive drugs called biologics, which are used to fight such illnesses as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes.
In the end, the AFL-CIO endorsed the pact, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other major business groups.
Some Republicans grumbled that Democrats took too long to get the agreement across the finish line, but many were quite happy with the result.
Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said the pact reminded him of when he would write a letter to Santa, and it would be answered with most of the presents he wanted on Christmas morning.
“This is certainly one of those times when the letter to Santa Claus actually got answered,” Kelly said.

""Clearly do you understand? When we know what their process is, we will know who and how many we will we send over,"" Pelosi said Thursday.

""A great day for the Constitution of the United States.  A sad one for America,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)
Democrats charged President Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress with both sides making the same arguments they've made for months. 
""But this isn't just about Donald Trump. They don't just hate Donald Trump Madam speaker, they hate the 63 million Americans who voted for this president, the forgotten men and women of this country who have been left behind, Madame speaker…,"" said Rep.

President Trump responded to Congress's action from his rally in Battlecreek, Michigan.

(AP) - Defiant in the face of a historic rebuke, President Donald Trump rallied supporters in Michigan on Wednesday night as the House voted to impeach him, declaring, “It doesn't really feel like we're being impeached.”
Trump took the stage just minutes before he became the third president in U.S. history to be impeached by the House of Representatives.
In a dramatic and discordant split-screen, Trump emerged from a mock fireplace at the Christmas-themed rally as the debate in Washington was underway. He took time to praise “the miracle of Christmas, the greatness of America and the glory of God,” even as he slammed Democrats, accusing the “radical left in Congress"" of being “consumed with envy and hate and rage.""
Aides had said Trump would wait to see the House vote before coming out to address the rally, but he appeared on stage early and promised “the best speech you've ever heard"" in a swing state that narrowly voted for him in 2016.
While Trump and his aides have tried to brush off the significance of the vote - noting there is little chance he will be convicted by the Republican-controlled Senate and removed from office - allies nonetheless acknowledged that Trump has been angry over the stain that impeachment will leave on his legacy.
Throughout the day, Trump stared down the impending vote as he has every obstacle in his presidency: by broadcasting his grievances via tweet.
While the White House insisted Trump would be busy working rather than focused on the proceedings in the House, he spent much of his day tweeting and retweeting, expressing fury and disbelief. 
“Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, AND I DID NOTHING WRONG!"" Trump wrote in one of 45 tweets posted before noon. He asked his followers to “Say a PRAYER!""
As members of the House debated the articles of impeachment, Trump's urgency appeared to escalate as he switched to all capital letters: “SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!"" he wrote.
The House considered two articles of impeachment. The first charges him with abuse of power for allegedly pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals while crucial U.S. security aid was being withheld. The second charges him with obstruction of Congress for stonewalling investigative efforts.
As the debate wore on, Trump aides, including White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, fanned out across Capitol Hill to bolster the president's message that impeachment is helping Republicans and damaging Democrats. Vice President Mike Pence got to Michigan ahead of Trump for a daylong bus tour before the Battle Creek rally. 
Serving as a warm-up act for Trump at the rally, Pence labeled the impeachment drive “a disgrace” and told the crowd that Democrats were “trying to impeach this president because they know they can’t defeat this president.""
He said Pelosi and the Democrats are “having their say tonight, but the Republican Senate is going to have their say in January.”
The president's middle son, Eric, told reporters during a campaign conference call that he and other Trump surrogates would be working to target Democrats in districts his father won in 2016.
“We’re going to win this thing again. They are handing it to us,"" he said. “But this is very sad that they are putting the country through this.""
Conway said recent polling and the influx of money suggest “this entire exercise has blown up in the Democrats' face."" Polls indicate the public is divided over whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, though opinions have generally remained steady.
Trump's campaign has experienced a surge in contributions and volunteers during the proceedings and was hoping to raise an additional $2 million Wednesday ahead of the votes. 
Trump, for his part, had plenty to say via tweet, declaring that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “Will go down in history as worst Speaker."" He also generously retweeted allies' comments from his favorite morning show, “Fox & Friends,"" as the hosts sought to reassure conservative voters that Trump remains in good spirits despite the looming vote.
Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, and Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said they were among a group of GOP lawmakers who met with Trump at the White House on Tuesday evening to talk strategy about Wednesday’s House session and the likely Senate trial in January.
McCarthy insisted that Trump remains focused on moving forward with his agenda, despite the implications for his legacy.
“Anybody else, this would be traumatic for them,” McCarthy said. “I've never seen a man so strong. ... He is focused on what the American people need.”
It was a message repeated by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who insisted on “Fox & Friends"" that the president has been a voice of calm for top administration officials, despite his public fury.
“He is such a focused president,"" Grisham said. ""I must tell you that while he's frustrated ... he is also so focused, and he is leading our White House and keeping us calm and telling us, 'That's OK, we're going to move forward, we're focused, this is going to take us through to 2020.'”

Democratic Lawmaker Jeff Van Drew Plans to Switch Parties Over Impeachment
Trump criticized the vote moments after the articles were approved as he addressed supporters at a rally in Battle Creek, Mich.
“They’re the ones that should be impeached,” Trump said of Democrat lawmakers. “House Democrats are trying to nullify the ballots of tens of millions of patriotic Americans,” he said.
The focus now shifts to the Senate where a trial will be held in January. The Senate needs a two-thirds majority vote for the impeachment articles to pass and two remove Trump from office. Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate, are expected to acquit the President. 
As CBN News reported, Senate leaders have already begun battling over the trial.  
Majority leader Mitch McConnell rejected Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) demand that he call witnesses, including Acting White House Chief of Staff. Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Advisor John Bolton. 
McConnell says it's not the Senate's job to prove the House's case. 
""If House Democrats' case is this deficient, this thin, the answer is not for the judge and jury to cure it here in the Senate,"" he said. 
 Just after the House voted White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham released the following statement:
""Today marks the culmination in the House of one of the most shameful political episodes in the history of our Nation.  Without receiving a single Republican vote, and without providing any proof of wrongdoing, Democrats pushed illegitimate articles of impeachment against the President through the House of Representatives.  Democrats have chosen to proceed on this partisan basis in spite of the fact that the President did absolutely nothing wrong.  Indeed, weeks of hearings have proved that he did nothing wrong.  
Throughout the House Democrats' entire sham impeachment, the President was denied fundamental fairness and due process under the law.  The House blatantly ignored precedent and conducted the inquiry in secrecy behind closed doors so that Chairman Adam Schiff and his partisan political cronies could selectively leak information to their partners in the media to push a false narrative. 
When public hearings were held before Chairman Schiff's committee, Democrats continued their games and denied the President the ability to cross-examine witnesses or present witnesses or evidence.  The proceedings in the Judiciary Committee included no fact witnesses at all and consisted solely of a biased law seminar and a staffer rehashing the slanted report that was produced by Chairman Schiff's rigged proceeding.  This unconstitutional travesty resulted in two baseless articles of impeachment that lack any support in evidence and fail even to describe any impeachable offense. 
All of these antics make clear that Democrats have lost sight of what this country needs, which is a Congress that works for the people.  Their boundless animus for President Trump fuels their desire to nullify the 2016 election results, and improperly influence the 2020 election.
The American people are not fooled by this disgraceful behavior.  They understand fairness, due process, and substantial, reliable evidence are required before any American should be charged with wrongdoing—and certainly before impeaching a duly elected President. 
The President is confident the Senate will restore regular order, fairness, and due process, all of which were ignored in the House proceedings.  He is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated.  President Trump will continue to work tirelessly to address the needs and priorities of the American people, as he has since the day he took office."""

Given we’re just days away from Christmas, the timing of such a comparison is especially sensitive. While Rep. Loudermilk may not have been specifically comparing Trump to Jesus but rather making a larger point about an unjust trial, the timing was clearly not all that well thought out.
Jesus was put to death in a gruesome fashion, having been beaten, tortured then nailed to a cross. Anytime the sacrifice of our Savior is mentioned to make a political point, it should fall somewhat flat because there simply is no comparison to what Christ accomplished on the cross versus anything happening today.
Regardless of how one feels about the merits (or lack thereof) of the impeachment hearings and vote happening today, there was no bigger injustice than Jesus’ murder.
But thankfully, Jesus conquered the grave and is sovereign over all. Rulers rise and fall under His direction, so we can rest assured that whatever the outcome of the impeachment hearing, Jesus is still in control."

'We Don't Need to Clean Up Their Sloppy Job': Senate GOP Rejects Dem Impeachment Demands
Impeachment Battle Already Moving to Senate Where Republicans Are Pushing Back
Democratic Lawmaker Jeff Van Drew Plans to Switch Parties Over Impeachment
In a six-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, the President slammed the move by Democrats calling it an ""illegal, partisan attempted coup.""
He also accused Pelosi of ""declaring open war on American democracy.""
Trump also wrote, ""More due process was afforded those accused in the Salem Witch Trials."" 
Pelosi replied that she's too busy to read the whole letter. 
""I haven't really fully read it,"" she said. ""We've been working. I've seen the essence of it though, and it's really sick.""
Meanwhile, Senate leaders are battling over the coming trial. 
Majority leader Mitch McConnell rejected Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) demand that he call witnesses, including Acting White House Chief of Staff. Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Advisor John Bolton. 
McConnell says it's not the Senate's job to prove the House's case. 
""If House Democrats' case is this deficient, this thin, the answer is not for the judge and jury to cure it here in the Senate,"" he said. 
On Tuesday night from New York City's Times Square to small towns across the country, impeachment supporters and opponents holding rallies. 
The two impeachment articles will be presented to the full House against the President on Wednesday -- Obstructing Congress and abusing the power of his office for personal gain. Democrats say he pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.
After a procedural vote, the House will spend 6 hours debating the two articles and then will hold the vote. 
The articles are likely to be approved as most Democrats, including those at risk of losing their seats say they will vote to impeach.  No Republicans support impeachment. 
Meanwhile, the latest polls by Real Clear Politics shows that Americans are split over impeachment with 46.9 percent in favor of impeaching and removing the President from office while 47.6 percent oppose it. "

A copy of the letter was posted online by the news website Politico.
""This impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers,"" the President wrote, ""unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history."" 
In the letter, Trump tells the House Speaker that he has been deprived of ""basic Constitution Due Process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present.""
""More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials,"" the President wrote.
Trump also reminded Pelosi the effect of his impeachment will not only echo throughout US history but will also be felt by Democrats in next year's election. 
Trump called the impeachment ""nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup that will, based on recent sentiment, badly fail at the voting booth.""
""Because of this colossal injustice, our party is more united than it has ever been before,"" he noted. 
Trump also called out Pelosi on her alleged knowledge that former Vice President Joe Biden used his office and $1 billion of US aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the prosecutor who was investigating Biden's son.
""You know this,"" the President wrote, ""because Biden bragged about it on video. Even Joe Biden admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it 'looked bad.'  Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely accusing me of doing what Joe Biden admitted he actually did.""
Trump also pointed to Ukraine's president's response when asked about the July 25 telephone call. 
""President Zelensky has repeatedly declared that I did nothing wrong,"" he wrote, ""and there was No Pressure.""
The President also points out that this impeachment effort was three years in the making. 
""Your chosen candidate lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide (306 - 227) and your party has never recovered from this defeat,"" he wrote. 
Trump concluded the letter to Pelosi writing ""there is far too much that needs to be done to improve the lives of our citizens. It is time for you and the highly partisan Democrats in Congress to immediately cease this impeachment fantasy and get back to work for the American People.  While I have no expectation that you will do so, I write this letter to you for the purpose of history and to put my thoughts on a permanent and indelible record.""
""One hundred years from now,"" the President wrote, ""when people look back at this affair, I want them to understand it, and learn from it, so that it can never happen to another President again.""

While Trump could be acquitted in the inevitable Senate trial next year, the battle is about how that process should play out. Senate Republicans are deliberating whether or not to call witnesses when impeachment moves to the upper chamber.
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has announced that he opposes the witness demands being made by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY).  ""It is not the Senate's job to leap into the breach and search desperately for ways to get to 'guilty',"" Politico reports McConnell saying as he's essentially blaming the House for failing to prosecute the case properly.
 
""I'm not trying to hide the fact that I have disdain for the accusations and the process. So I don't need any witnesses,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).
 
Many Republican senators argue they've already heard enough to push for a short Senate trial with no witnesses, but add they will take their cue from the White House.
 
""To me, if he would want witnesses called, I think that that delays it. There might be some pitfalls associated with it because I'm guessing we'd probably have to let their witnesses in as well, if they don't give us any new information what's the point?"" Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN) told CBN News. ""I think largely though the Senate ought to be listening to what the president wants to do through his team to finally litigate the defense.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer definitely announced the four witnesses Democrats would like to call forward earlier this week: Mick Mulvaney, Robert Blair, John Bolton, and Michael Duffey – witnesses the White House blocked from testifying in the House hearings.
 
""I don't know what they'll say, maybe they'll be exculpatory to President Trump but to not have them is to engage in a cover-up, it is to say we're afraid,"" explained Sen. Schumer on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kOPIVbyl3c
 
Sen. Schumer believes hearing from these witnesses will make the House case even stronger.
 
""We want the facts,"" continued Schumer. ""The four witnesses we've asked for, the documents we've asked for are directly dispositive on what the actual facts were. The House came up with a whole lot, but there's some of my Republican colleagues who say, 'look these charges are serious but I'm not sure there's enough evidence.' That's why these people should come.""
But Senate Republicans have rejected that idea, saying the House should have taken the time to go to court to force those witnesses to testify if they really thought their testimony was essential.
“We don't need to clean up their sloppy job,” said Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst.
“The House can't decide not to go to court, send us a half-baked case and then say now, ‘You make something out of it,’” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
 
Fifty-one votes are required to either call witnesses in a longer trial or directly move to a vote on the two articles of impeachment. If Republicans decide to call witnesses, which the president reportedly favors, that could open the door for calling Hunter Biden to testify.
 
Ahead of the House vote Wednesday - the pressure is so high New Jersey Democrat Jeff Van Drew, who already plans to vote ""no"" on impeachment, is reportedly preparing to switch to the Republican Party - news that triggered a mass resignation amongst his Capitol Hill staff.

But the fight is already moving to the Senate where leaders are working to set up a 2020 impeachment trial to put a final end to the controversial undertaking.
The top Democrat there, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY), wants to see several current and former Trump administration officials subpoenaed to testify in the Senate trial.
Schumer specifically wants to hear from White House officials who refused to participate in the House investigation - like current Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Mulvaney adviser Robert Blair, and former National Security Adviser John Bolton who may have left on bad terms with the president.

Democratic Lawmaker Jeff Van Drew Plans to Switch Parties Over Impeachment
It's not likely Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will comply with those demands since he has also reportedly pushed back on President Trump's desire to call witnesses like Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who orchestrated the Democrats' impeachment effort in the House, and former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden.
Schiff, who has been accused of rigging the impeachment proceedings and prejudging the outcome, said, ""I hope that the senators will insist on getting the documents, on hearing from the witnesses, on making up their own mind.""
McConnell and other GOP Senate leaders maintain that this impeachment effort is baseless.
And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) finds comments like Schiff's to be insincere. ""I am - clearly made up my mind. I'm not trying to hide the fact that I have disdain for the accusations and the process. So I don't need any witnesses,"" he said.
One House Democrat who opposes impeachment might switch parties in protest over the whole process. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey is rumored to be considering joining the Republican Party.
Meanwhile, two new polls show the American people are still divided. A Fox News poll shows 50 percent of Americans support impeaching and removing the president, while a USA Today poll shows 51 percent oppose a Senate vote removing him from office.
A House vote on the articles of impeachment could come as soon as Wednesday.

Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who has long opposed House Democrats’ impeachment effort, discussed switching parties in a meeting with President Donald Trump, an administration official said Saturday.
The official, who was not authorized to discuss the private conversation and spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Van Drew met with Trump in the White House on Friday.
Drew, a longtime state senator serving his first term in Congress, is one of his party's more endangered lawmakers in next November's elections. His southern New Jersey district narrowly favored Trump in 2016 and the congressional seat he won in 2018 had been under Republican control for nearly two decades.
The House is set to approve two articles of impeachment against Trump this coming week. Democrats, who hold the majority, expect support from all but a few of their members. No Republicans are expected to join them. 
The Republican-controlled Senate is then all but certain to acquit Trump after a trial in January. 
Van Drew has argued that the process is likely just to further divide the country and it would be better to let voters decide Trump's fate in next year's election. 
In the first article of impeachment, Trump is accused of abusing his presidential power by asking Ukraine to investigate his 2020 rival Joe Biden while holding military aid as leverage. In the second article, he's accused of obstructing Congress by blocking the House's efforts to investigate his actions.

The justices are poised to issue decisions in June, amid Trump's bid for a second term. Rulings against the president could result in the quick release of personal financial information that Trump has sought strenuously to keep private. The court also will decide whether the Manhattan district attorney can obtain eight years of Trump's tax returns as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.
Arguments will take place in late March. The subpoenas are separate from the ongoing impeachment proceedings against Trump, headed for a vote in the full House next week. Indeed, it's almost certain the court won't hear the cases until after a Senate trial over whether to remove Trump has ended.
Trump sued to prevent banks and accounting firms from complying with subpoenas for his records from three committees of the House of Representatives and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.
In three separate cases, he has so far lost at every step, but the records have not been turned over pending a final court ruling. Now it will be up to a court that includes two Trump appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, to decide.

In fact, he's being charged with obstruction of Congress which is a lesser charge.
WASHINGTON – Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee passed two articles of impeachment against President Trump Friday morning, accusing the president of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The impeachment case now heads to the full House of Representatives where Democrats have vowed to officially impeach Trump before Christmas.
However, after months of investigations and weeks of debate, it seems the number of people who either support or oppose the Democrats' push to impeach hasn't changed.
Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) abruptly postponed a committee vote late Thursday night that would have sent the articles to the full House of Representatives. That surprise move came after some 14 hours of often bitter partisan debate.
""We have an ongoing crime. We have a crime in progress,"" Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA) told the committee.
But staunch Trump defender Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said, ""It's not just an attack on the presidency. It's an attack on us. It's an attack on those of us who believe in this president."" 
""This is a constitutional crime spree, that's why our courage is do badly needed right here, right now. Our national security and our democracy are depending on it,"" said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA).
 
Although earlier this year Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said impeachment should be bipartisan, it appears that opposition to impeachment is what will have bipartisan support with some House Democrats abandoning their own party.
""The impeachment is going to fail and the Democrats will pay a heavy political price for it,"" predicted Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA).
A number of Democrats serving in swing districts fear a vote for impeachment could cost them their seat.
""I made a commitment to my district from the moment that this began that I'm going to focus on all the facts,"" explained Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) who serves in a swing district.
Senior Democratic aides tell the Washington Post the number of Democrats defecting could range from two to possibly six or more.
When asked about those moderate Democrats forced to take a tough vote, Speaker Pelosi said, ""People have to form to their own conclusions.""
Even with defections, the House is all but certain to impeach the president after which the Senate is expected to move quickly through its trial in the new year. And despite the president's call to subpoena high profile witnesses like Joe and Hunter Biden, Senate Republicans may not call any witnesses.
""There's zero chance obviously the president is going to be removed from office,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said during an interview on Fox News Channel.
And that appears to be the way Americans want it. According to a new Monmouth University Poll, voters still oppose impeachment by a slim majority 50 to 45 percent. Americans in swing states oppose it even more, and independent voters are strongly against impeachment from anywhere from eight to 19 points.
Despite their efforts, this hasn't been the homerun Democrats hoped for.

0,2019-12-13T03:15:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/december/senate-backs-measure-affirming-century-old-armenian-genocide,Senate Backs Measure Affirming Century-Old Armenian Genocide,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Mass killings of more than a million Armenians by Ottoman Turks a century ago were genocide, the Senate declared Thursday in a vote that prompted angry denunciations by Turkey and accusations that the U.S. was undermining its relations with a key NATO ally.
The Senate action follows a vote by a Senate committee to impose sanctions on Turkey after its offensive in Syria and purchase of a Russian S-400 missile system.
The actions were the latest by Congress to push President Donald Trump to take a harder line against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump said last month that Erdogan was “doing a fantastic job for the people of Turkey.″
The Armenian resolution and the sanction bill passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee “endanger the future of our bilateral relations,” said Fahrettin Altun, a spokesman for Erdogan.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Senate vote “is a shameful example of the politicization of history. However, those who use history for political purposes will never achieve their goals.″
The Armenian resolution had been blocked three times at the request of the White House, but won unanimous approval Thursday on its fourth try.
Co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the nonbinding resolution affirms that the genocide occurred and that Turkey is responsible.
“I say to my friends and colleagues that genocide is genocide,″ Menendez said on the Senate floor. “Senators in this body should have the simple courage to say it plainly, say it clearly and say it without reservation.″
Menendez and Cruz tried three times to bring up the resolution using a procedural maneuver that would allow approval on a voice vote, a way to avoid lengthy floor debate. Each time, a Republican senator objected, citing White House disapproval.
Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who objected to the measure last week, said he agreed to do so at the White House’s request because the vote would have occurred around the time of a NATO summit where Trump, Erdogan and other leaders gathered in London.
The House passed an identical resolution overwhelmingly in October in what was widely seen as a rebuke to Turkey after its invasion of northern Syria. Turkey has lobbied for years against U.S. recognition of the killings of Ottoman Armenians as genocide. Erdogan said during a White House visit last month that the House vote had “hurt deeply the Turkish nation” and had “a potential of casting a deep shadow over our bilateral relations.″
Activist groups cheered the Senate vote as long overdue. “The president ran out of people he could turn to to enforce Erdogan’s veto,″ said Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America.
Turkey’s decadeslong opposition to the resolution was “the longest-lasting veto over U.S. foreign policy” by a foreign power in American history, Hamparian said.
Historians estimate that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed around World War I, and many scholars see it as the 20th century’s first genocide. Turkey disputes the description, saying the toll has been inflated and those killed were victims of a civil war.
Instead of a resolution affirming the genocide, Turkey has called for a joint committee of historians to investigate the slayings.
Senate supporters got a big boost Thursday when reality TV star Kim Kardashian West took to social media to urge approval. “Please call your Senators NOW and urge them to vote YES on the #ArmenianGenocide resolution,″ she told her 153 million followers on Instagram. “Denial is the final stage of genocide,″ she added.
Kardashian West, who is of Armenian descent, also tweeted in support of the resolution.
Cruz called the vote a “moral duty,″ noting that a century ago, “the world remained silent” about the genocide, which even now is not widely known. The United States has an obligation to acknowledge the murder of “1.5 million innocent souls,″ Cruz said. “This is a moment of truth that was far too long coming.″
Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said the sanctions bill is intended to force Erdogan to “walk away from the S-400” missiles.
“As long as the S-400s are in Turkey under Turkish control, there will be no F-35s delivered to Turkey,″ Risch said, referring to a U.S.-led fighter jet program. “This is Erdogan’s choice, and he is well aware of the consequences.″
Republicans and Democrats in Congress are angry about Turkey’s S-400 purchase, which they see as a threat to NATO defenses.

Democrats Unveil 2 Articles of Impeachment Against President Trump
Republicans were fired up not only because they say the proposed articles of impeachment are baseless, but also because they say Democrats are running roughshod with this process.
""This is a travesty and a sham from day one. I could talk until I'm blue in the face but nobody on the majority cares,"" said Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) ""Facts be damned. They don't care.""
""Let us stay true to the facts and let's dispense of these process arguments and get to substance of why we're here today,"" reminded Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO)
Republicans call article one, the abuse of power assertion, weak and frivolous.
""Article one ignores the truth. It ignores the facts. It ignores what has been laid out to the American people over the last three weeks,"" noted Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio)
 ""It is not frivolous and without facts that we proceed...we proceed with facts,"" said Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee (D-Texas)
And Democrats say the fact is the President tried to withhold aid to Ukraine to muscle its president into opening an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden's son, who was on the board of directors for the Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings.
But Republicans say four facts refute that. One, there was no evidence of pressure during the infamous July 25 phone call between President Trump and Zelensky.  Two, they say there was no evidence of conditionality or quid pro quo.  Three, Ukraine never opened an investigation yet still received the aid. And four, Ukraine was not aware of aid being withheld.
""While the President claimed that there was no quid pro quo he made it clear that President Zelensky must publicly announce the two investigations that President Trump discussed on July 25 in the call in order for the security assistance to be lifted,"" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI). ""That's direct evidence."""

Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz detailed a failure in the FBI chain of command while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Horowitz carefully tried to have his testimony only reflect what is contained in the 400-page report about the Russia investigation dubbed ""Operation Crossfire Hurricane"".  
But he could not deny charges about FBI methods that some are calling sloppy at best, criminal at worst.
The IG's report, released Monday, essentially found just cause to initiate the Russia investigation, something Horowitz reiterated at the very beginning of his testimony. ""We found that Operation Crossfire Hurricane was opened for an authorized investigative purpose and with sufficient factual predication,"" Horowitz said.
But he quickly followed that statement with acknowledgement that investigators did not follow proper rules and procedures along the way. This included omitting or changing information on FISA applications that would allow surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page - information like the fact that the infamous Steele dossier, which was a big consideration in approving the applications, had been funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign.  Horowitz said the FISA court approved the surveillance applications multiple times based on incomplete information even though investigators knew better.
""The circumstances reflect a failure, as we outline in the report, not just by those who prepared the applications but also by the managers and supervisors in the Crossfire Hurricane chain of command including FBI senior officials who were briefed as the investigation progressed,"" Horowitz said.
The Inspector General went on to explain an overall lack of oversight within the FBI.
""Where time and again during our OIG interviews FBI managers, supervisors and senior officials displayed a lack of understanding or awareness of important information concerning many of the problems we identified,"" Horowitz said. ""It's pretty bad.""
Still, Horowitz underscored finding no political bias during his investigation, a claim Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) rebuffed.
""What has been described as a few irregularities becomes a massive criminal conspiracy over time to defraud the FISA court, to illegally surveil an American citizen and to keep an investigation open against a sitting president of the United States,"" Graham said.
Graham read aloud several text messages by some of those at the highest levels of Operation Crossfire Hurricane.
Graham quoted one message that said: ""I'm all riled up, Trump is an f-ing idiot who can't provide coherent answer.""
Another stated: ""Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart, I could smell the Trump support.""
Horowitz maintained those messages did not indicate the investigation was authorized improperly. Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) echoed that.
""I believe strongly that it's time to move on from the false claims of political bias,"" Feinstein said. ""And those who show great interest in politically motivated investigations against President Trump should show the same concern about politically motivated investigations requested by the President or his Attorney General.""
Attorney General Bill Barr has been very outspoken about his disagreement with Horowitz that the investigation was opened for proper reasons.  US Attorney John Durham has been as well.  Durham is still conducting a criminal investigation on the matter whereas the IG's report only recommends internal disciplinary action against several of those involved in making sure the Russia probe got off the ground."

Trump's latest executive order targets discrimination, specifically the growing problem of anti-Semitism on college campuses.
It's reported this order also changes the definition of Judaism to include nationality. That means certain anti-Israel movements would be considered a form of anti-Semitism. 
""Sadly BDS has also made disturbing headway on American college campuses,"" Trump said.

Trump also called out anti-Semitism among lawmakers in the nation's capital.
""You have to be very careful, make no mistake, radical lawmakers who support the BDS movement are advancing anti-Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda and Americans won't stand for it,"" Trump said. 
Trump's new order follows Tuesday's shooting in New Jersey that left 6 people dead in a targeted attack on a Jewish deli.

In his prayer, which lasted a little over one minute, he prayed excerpts from Psalm 23 and for lawmakers to have the ""eyes to discern and understand the intricate complexity of this turbulent season."" His prayer was shared on CSPAN and social media.  Here's what he prayed:

""Let us pray. Eternal Father, the center of our joy. Bless our lawmakers with the peace and wisdom needed to lead in our challenging world. Give them eyes to discern and understand the intricate complexity of this turbulent season. Lord, guide our senators to the right paths, lead them beside still waters, restore their souls.""
""Let them lack nothing, for You can keep them whole. Overflow their cups with gentleness, care and understanding for the people they represent. Let them fear no evil and take courage in adversity for You continue to lead them with Your all-knowing right hand. We pray in Your everlasting name, Amen.""

Some Americans are concerned there's an ongoing effort by atheists to remove prayer from the nation's halls of power, that God is no longer welcome in these halls. But Black says to take heart.  
""There are many, many lawmakers who are modeling civility,"" Black said. ""The challenge is that the legislative process by its very nature is adversarial.""
The importance of having prayer in Congress was on display in a powerful way this past summer, as well, when House Chaplain Rev. Patrick Conroy offered a powerful prayer for ""spirits of darkness"" to be removed from the chamber.
""In Your most holy name, I now cast out all spirits of darkness from this chamber, spirits not from You. I cast out the spirit of discouragement which deadens the hope of those who are of goodwill. I cast out the spirit of petty divisiveness, which clouds the sense and desires to be of fruitful productivity in addressing the issues more appropriately before this House.""
""I cast out any sadness brought on by the frustration of dealing with matters detrimental to the honorable work each member has been called to engage in,"" Conroy added.
The duties of the Senate Chaplain include opening the Senate each day in prayer, counseling and spiritual care for the senators, their families and their staffs - which is a combined constituency of 6,000 people. 
Chaplain Black's days involve meeting with senators about spiritual and moral issues and assisting the senators' staff with research on theological and biblical questions. 
 
Also, he teaches Senate Bible study groups where there is a reflection and discussion time among the attending senators and staff.
The role of the chaplain as a spiritual advisor and counselor has changed over the years. It began as a part-time position into a full-time career as one of the officers of the Senate. 
Black reminds citizens of the power in praying for wisdom for all our leaders.
""What many Americans may not realize, not only is prayer alive and well, there are hundreds of intercessors on Capitol Hill,"" Black told CBN News a few years ago.
""I get folks dropping by all the time, sometimes groups of individuals, dropping by all the time laying hands on me, praying for me. My staff knows that when a group comes in and when they leave my bow tie is crooked, they know that I was worked over by that group,"" he said. ""And they are here to demonstrate to the forces of evil you cannot win. Greater is He who is in us than he who is in the world."""

Unless something changes, it will happen starting next year through federal retirement plans. The somewhat quiet decision will affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers including our military.
""The single most important thing we can do about the emerging and burgeoning China threat, is to stop underwriting it,"" said Frank Gaffney who leads the Committee on the Present Danger: China.
He charges Wall Street is behind this underwriting effort because Morgan Stanley includes certain Chinese companies in its retirement portfolio. 
Gaffney says trillions pour into companies that not only promote human rights violations but also literally fight against us, like Aviation Industry Corporation of China.

""Building actual weapons systems designed to kill American servicemen and women and for that matter the rest of us,"" Gaffney says.
He is speaking out now because the US government sits ready to follow private industry.  
The board overseeing the Federal Retirement Thrift Savings plan has decided to include these same companies in its portfolio. This would affect service members, Congress, and the president's cabinet. Rep. Jim Banks is behind legislation that would prevent those federal funds from being invested in Chinese companies.
""Really we're talking about millions of dollars that are invested on behalf of federal employees,"" Banks said. ""It's almost hypocritical for the federal government to allow for those individuals who have worked for the federal government…to see their money being invested in companies who are very much antithetical to the interest of the United States.""
Hank Paulson served as Treasury Secretary for President George W. Bush. 
""Decoupling China from US markets by delisting Chinese firms from US exchanges is a terrible idea,"" Paulson said.
Paulson says the US survived the 2008 financial crisis by coordinating with other key economies like China's. He disagrees with the argument that American investment in Chinese companies threatens national security.
""Even as we build a high fence around a small yard to protect national security, we must not impair our individual and shared economic security and that of the rest of the world,"" Paulson said.
Gaffney insists that outlook is a mistake.
""On the one hand you've got the financial security which pretty much doesn't care about national security, it's all about the money,"" Gaffney says.  ""On the other hand you've got the national security guys who, by and large, with some exceptions, they don't know anything about finance.""
And in between, he says, lurks a dangerous place where the Chinese Communist Party has learned to thrive.
""It's simply scandalous,"" Gaffney said.
Gaffney and others like Congressman Banks hope sounding the alarm will help stop this type of foreign investment into the Thrift Savings Plan, but it's a long shot. "

“In every generation, Jewish American patriots have strengthened, sustained, uplifted, and inspired our nation,” Trump said, according to the White House.  “In a moment, the Shalva Band will conclude this event with a song that we know very well.  Before they do, I want to tell the famous story behind it.”
While the audience waited for the performance, President Trump passionately explained the details behind the famous song written by Irving Berlin.

“In 1918, a young Jewish American soldier stationed at Camp Upton, in New York, wrote a prayer in the form of a song,” Trump explained. “His name was Irving Berlin — may be the greatest of them all.  And he held that song close to his heart for more than 20 years.  He did not release the song until 1938, as the world learned of Hitler’s evil atrocities against the Jewish people. On November 10th of that year, his song broadcast through the radio and into the homes all across the country.  Millions and millions of people were inspired.  It was the first time Americans heard Irving Berlin’s timeless hymn, “God Bless America,” he said, drawing healthy applause from the crowd.

It was a time in which America was not afraid to pray. President Franklin D. Roosevelt would often lead the nation in prayer on his radio broadcasts, especially during the war. Trump fondly recalled the way the nation reacted to the song as a song of prayer.
“These words became the prayer of our nation, the prayer that traveled to the islands of the Pacific, to the beaches of Normandy, and all the way to Nazi territory, where American soldiers open the gates of concentration camps and liberated Jewish survivors,” he said.
Trump then went on to explain that the song has been something we have turned to often in times of trouble throughout our nation’s history, even to this day.
“It’s the prayer that Americans sang as we faced down communism and as we came together as one nation after 9/11.  It’s the prayer that still unites us today and the hope that burns bright in our hearts because we are proud American patriots,” Trump said.  “We love this magnificent nation with every ounce of our strength, spirit, and soul.”
With that, Trump concluded by inviting the musicians to begin playing. It was a powerful scene to see the song performed so beautifully, after such a wonderful setup.
“So tonight, together, we ask that God bless our military.  We ask that God bless our veterans.  We ask that God bless our cherished ally, the State of Israel.  And with our flag-waving high, our people standing tall, and our faith forever strong, we say our prayer once more: God bless America, our home sweet home.”

""We stand here today because the president's continuing abuse of power left us no choice. To do nothing would make us complicit in the president's abuse of his high office, the public trust, and our national security,"" claimed House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, (D-CA). 
Fired up Republicans quickly offered their rebuttal.
""It is not difficult to defend this president, but it is very difficult to defend this Congress and what they have done, and history will not be kind to them,"" noted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). 
Republicans maintain President Trump is innocent and Democrats are abusing the powers of impeachment because they dislike the president.
""They're not impeaching the president because they can list an impeachable offense, they're impeaching him because they're afraid he will get re-elected,"" said House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).
Schiff argues they can't wait until November for voters to be the judge.

This is not only a win for lawmakers but also for President Trump. The commander-in-chief calls this the ""largest trade deal ever made,"" and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sees it as ""a victory for America's workers.""

The Fate of Trump's USMCA Trade Deal: Where Did All Those Pro-Trade Democrats Go?
""Every once in a while you get to participate in a 'it will never happen' moment,"" Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) said. 
Pelosi admitted Democrats in Congress had held up the trade deal so they could get what they wanted. ""We were in range for a while but until we could cross a certain threshold of enforcement for our workers' rights, for the environment, for prescription drug issue..."" she explained.
This move comes after President Trump criticized Pelosi and her team as ""do nothing"" Democrats. 
The US, Mexico, and Canada reached the agreement last year. President Trump's just been waiting for the House to approve it ever since. He said there's a reason the Democrats made their announcement on the same day they announced impeachment articles.
""And then an hour later she announced that she's going to do USMCA. You know why? It's a huge deal and it plays down the impeachment because they are embarrassed by the impeachment. And our poll numbers have gone through the roof because of her stupid impeachment,"" Trump said.
""We came a long way from what he originally proposed,"" Pelosi said. ""There are some people who say why make it look like he has a victory? We are declaring victory for the American worker by what is in this agreement.""
Since President Trump signed the USMCA last year, the White House has been trying to win over House Democrats to get the deal through Congress. 
""There is no question that this trade agreement is much better than NAFTA,"" Pelosi admitted.
Even Republicans seemed to give the new deal the green light. House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy said, ""If we are going to be competing we need to be stronger. We would get a better commitment with China if we had USMCA done, we would be in a stronger position."" 
US Trade Representative Robert Lightizer, White House advisor Jared Kushner and the Canadian Deputy Prime Minister are expected to be in Mexico City on Tuesday for a signing ceremony.
 
In the meantime, President Trump is fighting back on impeachment via Twitter calling it a witch hunt, adding ""Nadler just said that I pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 election. Ridiculous, and he knows that is not true."" 
Trump continues to press lawmakers to read the transcript and that ""us"" is a reference to the USA, not him. "

House Judiciary Committee Moves Forward with Impeachment Hearing, Republicans Call It a 'Farce' 
The filing of the articles is a major step in Democrats’ efforts to make Trump the third US president to be impeached. It is only the fourth time in history that Congress has attempted to remove a sitting President from office.
The House Judiciary Committee could vote on the articles later this week, sending them to the House floor where lawmakers will need a majority vote to send them to the Senate.
If the articles pass in the House, the case will move to the Senate for a formal trial likely beginning in January, the Wall Street Journal reports.
Democratic lawmakers announced the charges against Trump at a press conference on Tuesday morning after more than 100 hours of deposition and 17 witnesses.
Notably absent from The Post’s report on the charges was a “bribery” count. Democrats have repeatedly accused Trump of bribing Ukraine with military aid to investigate political rival, Joe Biden. CNN reported that Democrats debated whether to also include another article of “obstruction of justice” related to allegations in the Mueller report.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi met with her team Monday evening after a 10-hour Judiciary Committee but declined to discuss the articles or the impending announcement.
When asked if she thinks she has enough votes in the House to move the case to the Senate, Pelosi said she has not counted the votes. 
“On an issue like this, we don’t count the votes. People will just make their voices known on it,” Pelosi said at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council. ""I haven’t counted votes, nor will I.”
Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters Monday while exiting Pelosi’s office that “a lot of us believe what happened with Ukraine especially is not something we can just close our eyes to.”
“I think there's a lot of agreement,” he said. ""You’ll hear about some of it tomorrow.”
The filing of the articles is a major step in Democrats’ efforts to make Trump the third US president to be impeached.
During Monday’s lengthy judiciary committee, Democrats argued that Trump’s push to have Ukraine investigate Biden while withholding military aid constitutes a violation of US policy and benefitted both himself and Russia.
“President Trump’s persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security,” said Dan Goldman, the director of investigations at the House Intelligence Committee.
Republicans dismissed the allegations against Trump. Rep Doug Collins (R-GA), who serves on the judiciary committee, said the impeachment process is like a criminal proceeding with no crime.
“We don’t have a crime; we don’t have anything we actually can defend,” he said.
Collins also accused Democrats of trying to force impeachment before the 2020 presidential election.
“They can't get over the fact that Donald Trump is the president of the United States, and they don’t have a candidate that can beat him,"" Collins said.
The White House is refusing to participate in the impeachment process. While Trump’s allies acknowledge that he will likely be impeached in the Democratic-controlled House. However, they expect acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate."

Bush, announced his candidacy Monday for a congressional seat in Texas, becoming the latest member of his famous Republican family to enter politics.
But his first run for office won’t be easy. Bush joins one of the nation’s most crowded congressional races of 2020 in his bid to replace Republican Rep. Pete Olson, who is retiring from his suburban Houston district that Democrats nearly flipped last year and are aggressively targeting again.
Pierce Bush’s announcement video, rolled out on the deadline in Texas for candidates to get on the 2020 ballot, includes an image of him speaking next to a picture of his late grandfather, who died last year.
“We face a very challenging time in our nation,” Bush says, adding that the country is “on the brink of losing a generation to an idea that socialism and free stuff are the answers to their future. But we all know that socialism has failed everywhere and everyone.”
His candidacy opens a new test for the Bush name in the Trump era. Other Republican candidates in the field have expressed unwavering support for President Donald Trump, who has clashed with the Bush family that for decades defined the GOP establishment. George H.W Bush voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and President George W. Bush didn’t vote for either one of them.
The only Bush currently in public office, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, broke with his family in 2016 and supported Trump. During a visit to Texas earlier this year, Trump introduced George P. Bush, who is the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, as “the only Bush that likes me.”
Pierce Bush, whose father is Neil Bush, has spent the past three years as chief executive of the nonprofit Big Brothers Big Sisters in Texas. He made no mention of Trump in his announcement video and launched his campaign website with only a short biography and no positions on issues or policies.
Olson is one of six of House Republicans in Texas retiring next year, and he might have faced tougher re-election battled than any of them. Once a seat of GOP power — former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay held the office before Olson — the district is rapidly shifting amid demographic changes and Democrats peeling off suburban women voters.
Olson narrowly won his seat by fewer than 5 points in 2018. The district covers Fort Bend County, one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the nation. Last week, the county’s white Republican state representative, Rick Miller, abruptly dropped his re-election bid after telling the Houston Chronicle that his primary challengers were motivated to run against him because of race, accusing one of determining “that my district might need an Asian to win.”"

The committee will convene on Monday to formally receive the Intelligence Committee's report on the impeachment inquiry.
Attorneys with the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees put together their case over the weekend on at least two or more charges against President Trump.

Democrat Breaks Ranks, Warns His Party on Impeachment
Earlier this year Pelosi said impeachment had to be bipartisan, but all Republicans are united against it.

That is to say, I think we'll see some Democrats vote no, and I think you'll see the Democrats that vote yes will have some serious questions to answer to their constituents.""
    
He's right. Already Democratic Congressman Jeff Van Drew says he plans to vote against all articles of impeachment and warns Democrats to ""be careful what you wish for.""
Van Drew represents a district in New Jersey that voted for the president in 2016. Other Democrats in similar situations may follow his lead.
Pelosi Snaps at Reporter
Meanwhile, in her weekly press conference, a typically poised Pelosi got riled when journalist James Rosen asked if she hates the president.
Pointing her finger Pelosi cited her Catholic Faith.
""I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president. And I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time. So, don't mess with me when it comes to words like that,"" she said before walking off stage.
Trump responded to Pelosi on Twitter, saying he doesn't think she's praying for him at all. ""She says she 'prays for the President.' I don't believe her, not even close.""
Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she “prays for the President.” I don’t believe her, not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?

Biden responded by cursing and calling the man a liar. Then he launched into a fiery response.
""That's not true. And no one has ever said that. No one has proved that,"" he said as he walked toward the man who stood to speak at the town hall event.
After challenging his questioner to a push-up contest and an IQ test, Biden claimed, ""No one has said my son has done anything wrong, and I did not on any occasion, and no one has ever said it.""
As the heated exchange continued, Biden said, ""You said I set up my son to work in an oil company. Isn't that what you said? Get your words straight, Jack."" 
What's Next for Impeachment

More than half of Americans believe that churches and religious organizations are good for the country, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. But in a seemingly contradictory result, 63 percent say the church and other houses of worship should stay out of politics.
In other words, Americans think the church has a positive impact on society, but they also think the church should keep quiet on cultural and political issues that set the present and future course for our society. Or more directly: Churches, you make this country better, now stay out of the important matters that define our country. 
Huh?
For evangelicals such as myself, this issue has profound personal implications. As my former pastor repeatedly said, the church is not a building, it is a movement. Accordingly, a push to keep the church out of a particular part of society is effectively a push to exclude Christians.
But should any group remove itself (or be involuntarily removed) from the workings of our constitutional republic?
We live in a representative form of government, which means that we elect individuals to represent us in matters of personal, local, and national significance. The policies adopted and laws passed by those representatives impact the present and future of every citizen. They impact our families, our children's education, our businesses, our churches, our local communities, our states, and the world.
As citizens, we have a moral obligation to participate in culture, public policy, and yes…politics. 
If you are a Christian, you have a spiritual obligation to be ""salt and light"" by seeking the good of your community. This means Christians are called to live out our faith outside the four walls of our homes. We need to be involved not just in our churches, but in our communities.
Despite this reality, and consistent with the survey results mentioned above, ""I'm not political"" has become a popular refrain from people of faith. It also serves as shorthand for voluntary abstention from any public debate pertaining to ""hot button"" issues. Christians might say, ""I'm eager to share the gospel, but I don't want to address topics including same-sex marriage, abortion, gender identity, human sexuality, euthanasia, healthcare, immigration, and the welfare system. I just want to talk about the gospel.""
Wait.
Gospel means ""good news."" As you thumb through the pages of the Bible, you'll find a message of hope on any number of topics. There is good news about our inherent value as humans, from our mother's womb all the way to natural death. There is also good news about how God has uniquely made men and women. And there is good news about God's design for marriage as a reflection of Christ and the church.
This is not to suggest that every Christian will hold identical views on certain complex matters, such as the best way to structure healthcare, or how to address the immigration crisis, or what it will take to jettison the ""crazy"" from the educational system. But the Bible has plenty to say on a host of issues, and where it lacks specificity, it offers general principles that should be carefully considered. 
Lest we forget, the Bible is unlike any other book ever written. Sixty-six ancient manuscripts completed over a span of more than 1,500 years by 40 authors on three continents. It offers timeless and proven principles for life, relationships, marriage, parenting, and so much more. Should we simply cast it aside when it comes to the laws and policies we endorse? And the candidates we support? 
In any instance, Christians should take care not to abandon our role, both as citizens and as messengers for the gospel. Jesus didn't die on the cross and redeem and transform us so that we could be quarantined from the culture. He came to save us so that we could permeate the culture, serving as ambassadors to a world in need of Him.

Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford (R) says even though the government is collecting more tax revenue than at any other time in American history, the country is still drowning in debt.
The overall national debt stands at $23 trillion right now – and Lankford warns that could sink our economy.
“We're approaching a time where it would take the income of every single American for the entire year to be collected as taxes to pay off our debt,"" he says.
""These kinds of numbers can't be sustained, and everyone quietly knows it in the back of their mind, but dealing with debt and deficit seems to be one of those things we'll deal with the future, someday, someday, someday,"" he continues. ""We should be taking on the issues of debt and deficit now.""
For example, US taxpayers paid $371 billion on interest payments alone on America's national debt just last year. And this year we'll spend $423 billion on interest payments. Lankford points out that money could have been used for health care, transportation, or national defense, but instead it was spent on nothing.
Lankford’s office has put out its latest annual “Federal Fumbles” report, documenting foolish federal spending. He argues that smaller cases of wasteful spending need to be tackled to address the bigger, looming debt crisis.
Here are a few examples:
A nearly $2 million study on sea lions in Russia;
A $600,000 documentary on Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin;
Almost half a billion dollars to rent tents, instead of buying them, along the southern border.
Overall, the report lists $383 billion in wasteful and inefficient federal spending. The senator suggested just cutting out all the government’s wasteful spending could save tens of billions of dollars a year.

Lawmakers heard from four constitutional scholars on what constitutes ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Democrats called three witnesses. Republicans had one.
""If what we're talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" said Prof. Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina Law School.

House Committee Releases Trump Impeachment Inquiry Report, Republicans Submit Response
The scholars brought in by Democrats argued that the Ukraine scandal is proof President Trump abused his power for personal political gain. All three believe he should be impeached.
""President Trump's conduct as described in the testimony and evidence, clearly constitutes impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution,"" said Prof. Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School.
Republicans were allowed to call one of their own experts, who didn't defend the president but argued Democrats are moving too fast and have not proven their case.
""It's wrong because this is not how you impeach an American president,"" said Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School. ""Why would you want to set the record for the fastest impeachment? Fast is not good for impeachment.""
Turley noted that he's not a fan of Trump and didn't vote for him, adding more credibility to his non-partisan testimony.

Prof. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School testifies in House impeachment hearing.
""I get it. You are mad. The President is mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My Republican friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog is mad.... and Luna is a golden doodle and they are never mad. We are all mad and where has it taken us? Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration? That is why this is wrong,"" Turley said in his prepared remarks.
Turley argues the Democrats' case against Trump is being rushed and the evidence is flimsy at this point.
One moment that went viral came when the Democrats' third witness invoked the president's young son's name.
 
""The Constitution says there can be no titles of nobility,"" said Prof. Pamela Karan of Stanford Law School. ""So while the president can name his son Barron, he can't make him a baron.""
Barron Trump is only 13 years old, and Republican lawmakers pushed back sharply about his name being dragged into the hearing.
""Let me also suggest that when you invoke the president's son's name here, when you try to make a little joke out of referencing Barron Trump, that does not lend credibility to your argument,"" said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL). ""It makes you look mean.""
First Lady Melania Trump also shot back on Twitter saying ""a minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics.""
Karlan later apologized. ""It was wrong of me to do that,"" she admitted on the witness stand.
Overseas at NATO, President Trump called the hearing ""boring"" and criticized its fairness.
""They get three constitutional lawyers and we get one. What's that all about?"" he told reporters. ""We had no representation. We couldn't call witnesses. We couldn't do anything. It is the most unfair thing that anybody's ever seen.""
CBN's chief political analyst David Brody said Democrats ""botched"" the hearing and didn't break any new ground.
""When it's partisan like this and you want to move public opinion, you can't be more partisan,"" he said. ""You have to somehow figure out a way to get more of the public on your side. They didn't do that.""
The White House has until the end of Thursday to decide if it will participate in any of the next hearings. A full House vote is expected before Christmas."

Bloomberg, a businessman and former mayor of New York City, is worth approximately $56 billion, ranking him among the top ten richest people in America.
He is also a passionate abortion advocate. In 2014, he led a $50 million initiative to help women in Nicaragua, Burkina Faso, Senegal and Uganda “freely and safely make decisions about when to have children,” by attaining abortions.
As mayor of New York, he championed the issued by supporting a Manhattan statute that ensured public OB-GYN residents were taught how to perform abortions.
“When I was elected mayor, one of the first things we did was make sure that all city hospitals teach OB-GYN residents reproductive care, including how to safely perform abortions – something we did amid much criticism,” he said of the program, according to ChristianHeadlines.
In a recent column at Newsmax, Catholic activist Bill Donohue called Bloomberg “one of the most radical pro-abortion politicians in American history.”
“Bloomberg’s passion for abortion allowed him to appropriate $15 million from a civic facility revenue bond transaction that benefited Planned Parenthood,” Donohue added. “In 2012, the proceeds of the bond were used to finance the renovation of 104,000 square feet of space in the building that housed the abortion giant, supplying it with equipment and furnishing.”

Those on the inside, it seems, agree.
“To say he’s one of the biggest champions for women in this country and all over the world would be an understatement,” Jill Lafer, a former national chairwoman of Planned Parenthood, told The New York Times after Bloomberg made a cash donation of $250,000 to the group.
“The stakes could not be higher,” Bloomberg said after he announced his candidacy. “We must win this election.” Unfortunately for him, the polling numbers indicate that this is almost impossible.
“Mike Bloomberg is one of the richest men in the world,” wrote Jake Novak at CNBC. “But he’s about to learn a priceless lesson: You can’t buy the American presidency.”"

Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor who was called by Republicans to testify, opened his remarks by making one thing clear.
""I'm not a supporter of President Trump. I voted against him,"" Turley declared.
Turley then, however, laid out his case for why he's against impeaching Trump.
""I believe this impeachment not only fails to satisfy the standard of past impeachments but would create a dangerous precedent for future impeachments,"" Turley explained. ""To impeach a president on this record would expose every future president to the same type of inchoate impeachment.""
And he cautioned Democrats about pursuing the charge of obstruction of justice as well.
""Obstruction is a crime with meaning. It has elements. It has case authority,"" Turley continued. ""The record does not establish obstruction in this case. What my esteemed colleague said was certainly true. If you accept all of their presumptions, it would be obstruction. But impeachments have to be based on proof, not presumptions.""
But the other witnesses cautioned about a different precedent being set. 
""If what we're talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" declared UNC law professor Michael Gerhardt.
The three Democrat witnesses also expressed concern Trump might solicit foreign interference again. 
""The evidence reveals a president who used the powers of his office to demand that a foreign government participate in undermining a competing candidate for the presidency,"" said Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan.
While it is still not certain articles of impeachment will be brought to the House floor, Democrats appear ready to move forward.

Republicans argue Democrats have planned this since they lost the 2016 election.
""You just don't like the guy,"" said Ranking Member Doug Collins (R-GA). ""You didn't like him since November of 2016.""
The House Judiciary Committee will be tasked with officially drawing up articles of impeachment if they decide to move forward. But Democrats say there is no specific timeline yet on when the articles could be brought to the House floor."

But does that mean all holy activities must be separated from government?  One group says definitely not.  It's an assembly of Christians who, every year, just feet from the US Supreme Court, bring alive the night of Jesus Christ's birth.
 
It's not just a religious gathering but a Live lesson about Americans' religious liberty rights.  
The scene those Christians present is a live Nativity, including baby Jesus and all those, both two-legged and four-legged, that might have gathered around His manger.   That means a camel, a cow, and goats parading around Capitol Hill, much to the delight of tourists and families passing by, who stopped in droves to snap photos and selfies with the beasts.
 
Peggy Nienaber as the vice president of the religious rights group Faith & Liberty helps organize the Live Nativity every year.
 
She told CBN News, ""A lot of the people forget it between the hustle and the bustle, all the stuff that goes on – the politics on Capitol Hill – there's a reason that we do this: it's the reason for the season and it's the birth of Jesus Christ.""  
 
Some might argue that the specific location of this Nativity scene violates the separation of church and state. Lawyer Mat Staver, the founder of the Liberty Counsel, says it really doesn't.
 
""There is no separation of church and state that requires the government to censor religious viewpoints and speech,"" Staver argued. ""In fact, it's actually the opposite.  The government cannot censor religious speech. And this is clearly the essential message of the Christmas season.""
 
Nienaber added, ""Our First Amendment right gives us the right to get permits and to hold different events on Capitol Hill, and our event happens to be our outreach, which is the live Nativity.""
 
Participants prayed, worshipped, read the Nativity story from the Bible – and that was all.
 
""We're not mixing politics in with this,"" Nienaber explained.  ""We're not pushing any kind of legislation.  We're just letting you know what the true time of the year is.""
 
Staver added, ""And sharing that with not only the people here in the nation's capital but people around the world, who'll be surprised as they see a live Nativity in front of the United States Supreme Court.""

Now, the Ukrainian billionaire who hired him is under investigation and is reported to be in hiding.  
Mykola (Nikolay) Zlochevsky, one of the most powerful men in Ukraine, hired Biden as a company director and head of the legal department at Burisma Holdings, Ukraine's largest private oil and gas producer, and paid him $50,000 a month, despite the fact that Biden had little to no experience in the energy sector or Ukrainian law. Biden was used as the face of Burisma in a company promotional video.
In an ABC News interview, Biden was asked why he got the job without extensive knowledge of the natural gas industry or Ukraine. He said, ""I think I had as much knowledge as anybody else on the board, if not more.""
But during the impeachment inquiry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent said Biden's involvement with Burisma, while his father, Vice President Joe Biden, was negotiating with Ukraine, was a cause of concern. 
Kent testified, ""There was the perception of a conflict of interest.""
And now Hunter Biden finds himself tied to a businessman suspected of the theft of government funds on an especially large scale, according to Ukraine's chief prosecutor who has reopened all investigations involving Zlochevsky amid allegations of embezzling state funds. 
  
While serving as Ukraine's ecology minister, Zlochevsky was suspected of providing gas production licenses and permits to his own companies. There are also allegations of tax evasion. 
But Ukrainian authorities reportedly do not know Zlochevsky's whereabouts. One report says he's hiding out in Monaco.

Legal and constitutional experts are taking the stand to discuss constitutional grounds for impeachment.
""This is the result of a president who believes that he is beyond indictment, beyond impeachment, beyond any form of accountability and indeed above the law,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) claimed in a press conference.
On Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee voted along party lines to release a 300-page report on its investigation into alleged misconduct by President Trump in regard to Ukraine.
The report accuses the president of putting his personal, political interests above national interests and obstructing justice by forbidding White House aides to testify.
""This is not about Ukraine. This is about our democracy. This is about our national security,"" Schiff said.
The president responded from the NATO Summit in London.
""I think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being. I think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious. I think he is a very sick man,"" Trump told the media.
Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Chief of Staff Milk Mulvaney are also implicated in the report, accused of being complicit in the president's push to withhold military aid from Ukraine for political purposes.
In a press conference virtually ignored by the media, Republicans released a report of their own, pointing out that the impeachment inquiry did not meet Speaker Pelosi's criteria of compelling, overwhelming and bi-partisan. 
""They have one big problem and the problem is that the president did nothing wrong,"" said Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee. ""And they can't prove it.""
Now Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee will try to make their case that Trump's conduct constitutes grounds for impeachment. Then they'll officially draft the articles of impeachment. 
The lone GOP witness in the Judiciary Committee hearings is 
George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. Politico reports Turley believes the case is flimsy and that it would be a historic mistake for Democrats to impeach Trump with such little evidence.
 
""If the House proceeds solely on the Ukrainian allegations, this impeachment would stand out among modern impeachments as the shortest proceeding, with the thinnest evidentiary record, and the narrowest grounds ever used to impeach a president,"" Turley says.
The full House is expected to vote on the articles before Christmas. If approved, there would be a Senate trial.
President Trump said he's willing to let his closest advisers testify in a Senate trial, where he says the process will be fair, unlike what he calls the 'sham' process in the House.
Trump's approval ratings have stayed pretty locked in and voter's opinions haven't changed since the start of the hearings: 47 percent support removing Trump while 43 percent are opposed."

""If you look at impeachment, the word impeachment, here there was nothing wrong, nothing was done wrong. It was a perfect conversation with a very nice gentleman, the president of Ukraine. The conversation was perfect,"" continued Trump.

Trump signed the bills, which were approved by near-unanimous consent in the House and Senate, even as he expressed some concerns about complicating the effort to work out a trade deal with China’s President Xi Jinping.
“I signed these bills out of respect for President Xi, China, and the people of Hong Kong,” Trump said in a statement. “They are being enacted in the hope that Leaders and Representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all.”
Congress approved the bills last week following months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. Before Wednesday’s signing announcement, Trump would only commit to giving the measures a “hard look.”
China had threatened to take unspecified, “strong countermeasures” if the bills were signed into law.
The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act mandates sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who carry out human rights abuses and requires an annual review of the favorable trade status that Washington grants Hong Kong.
Another bill prohibits export to Hong Kong police of certain nonlethal munitions, including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, water cannons, stun guns and tasers.
The munitions bill was passed unanimously, while Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the sole House member to oppose the human rights bill.
Trump acknowledged last week that he was weighing the ramifications of signing the bill.
“Look, we have to stand with Hong Kong,” Trump said in an interview on “Fox & Friends.” He continued: “But I’m also standing with President Xi. He’s a friend of mine. He’s an incredible guy.”
Democratic and Republican lawmakers applauded the signing of the bills. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said it “finally sends a clear and unequivocal message to the people of Hong Kong: We are with you.”
Sen. Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican, and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said the bills are “an important step forward in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy and its repression of fundamental human rights.”

The Judiciary panel scheduled its first hearing for Dec. 4 as it decides whether to write articles of impeachment against Trump. 
The committee takes over the process handled so far by the Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Trump's alleged efforts to push Ukraine to take action against his political rivals.
Trump and his lawyers have been invited to attend the hearing and make a request to question witnesses, according to Democratic rules approved by the House last month. The committee released a letter from is chairman Jerrold Nadler, (D-NY), to the Republican president, saying he hopes Trump will participate, ""consistent with the rules of decorum and with the solemn nature of the work before us.""
The White House said Wednesday no decision had been made whether to send a representative.
""But what is obvious to every American is that this letter comes at the end of an illegitimate sham partisan process,"" press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.
The Intelligence Committee is wrapping up its investigative phase of the probe and preparing its report for the next phase of the process. 
Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has said the report could be released soon after the House returns from its Thanksgiving break.
Meanwhile, media outlets are reporting that even though Republicans and Democrats rarely agree on anything these days, there is one thing on which they do agree:  the impeachment hearings are a waste of time and money. 
""Everything they say, it's so repetitive. To me, it's like they're beating their heads against the wall,"" said Harry Rose, a 78-year-old retired factory worker and Trump supporter in Racine County, a swing county in the swing state of Wisconsin.

This move by the court contradicts President Trump's order for McGahn not to testify.
But the Justice Department is telling the court not so fast. On Tuesday, they filed an appeal to the judge's order.
If you read the bulk of the appeal, it points out that it's only the second time in history a court has ruled a senior advisor to the president must testify.
A new Politico/Morning Consult poll reveals that two weeks of testimony didn't move the needle much when it comes to swaying voters.
The survey found 48% back the impeachment inquiry, which is unchanged from a previous poll. While 43% oppose, which is down by two points.
President Trump tweeted ""support for impeachment is dropping like a rock.""
White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway echoed the President Tuesday at the White House.
""I think Pelosi is stuck but she put herself thereby not doing serious things like USMCA, reducing drug prices, raising wage growth. All of this is happening without a serious democratic congress,"" Conway said.
To top that, the tide could be turning against impeachment after one Michigan Democrat lawmaker has changed sides. 
Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-MI) is now calling for a resolution to censure the President.  With the 2020 Elections so close, she sees ""no value"" in impeachment.
She does believe it's important for the House to go on record calling Trump's actions wrong.
""She is in a heavily Democratic district. I would assume she is a loyal Democratic member but she made very clear we are so close to the next election that, that gives her pause as well,"" Conway said.

A White House official says Trump has given the $100,000 he would be paid in the quarter to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health, which oversees federal public health offices and programs, including the surgeon general’s office.
The White House says the funds are being earmarked “to continue the ongoing fight against the opioid crisis.”
Trump has made tackling the misuse of opioids an administration priority. More than 70,000 Americans died in 2017 from drug overdoses, the bulk of them involving opioids.
Trump is required to be paid, but he has pledged to donate his salary while in office to worthy causes. Trump donated his second-quarter salary to the surgeon general’s office.

CBN News takes a look at how his late entry could affect the race.
Bloomberg's campaign is already shaping up to look far different than his rivals. With an estimated worth of $53 billion, Bloomberg says he won't take a penny in campaign donations. If elected, he'll work for one dollar a year, and he'll spend whatever it takes to win the nomination.
Over the next two weeks, he hopes to introduce himself to voters courtesy of a $37 million television advertising campaign. A sum that totals more than half of the $50 million spent thus far on TV ads by the current field of Democrat presidential candidates

""Mike Bloomberg for President. Jobs creator, leader, problem-solver. It's going to take all three to build back a country. Mike Bloomberg started as a middle-class kid who had to work his way through college, then built a business from a single room to a global entity, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs along the way,"" the copy for the television commercial reads. 
It's a move that's catching heat from his opponents like Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Andrew Yang. 
""We do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections,"" Sanders said. 
""You can't buy passion,"" Yang responded. ""If you have to put people against money, I will take people every day of the week. 
Over the years, Bloomberg has fought for gun control, combating tobacco use, and cutting American's carbon footprint. Ahead of his campaign announcement, the 77-year-old former Republican visited an African American megachurch in Brooklyn, New York, to apologize for his controversial stop and frisk policy.
""I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong,"" he told the congregation. 
Bloomberg argues he's the antithesis of Donald Trump, who he calls a ""failed businessman whose companies went bankrupt multiple times"" while touting himself as a ""proven leader with an unmatched track record in business and government.""
""Beating Trump and rebuilding America is the most urgent and important fight of our lives, and I'm going all in,"" the former New York City mayor said. 
On Monday, he kicked his campaign off at an event in Norfolk, VA. 
 ""If President Trump wins another term in office we may never recover from the damage that he can do,"" Bloomberg told the audience. 
CBN News spoke with several people at Monday's campaign event. Their reaction was mixed on how they feel about Bloomberg jumping in the race. Some were excited while others don't quite know who he is. 
With ten weeks to go before the Iowa caucus, it's unclear if his massive war chest will be able to buy support and name recognition in those crucial first voting states where his opponents have been campaigning for months.  "

At Esper’s request, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer submitted his resignation Sunday, said the chief spokesman for the Pentagon, Jonathan Hoffman.
  
The firing was a dramatic turn in a fast-changing and politically charged controversy involving Navy Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher. On Wednesday the Navy had notified Gallagher that he would face a Navy SEAL review board to determine if he should be allowed to remain in the elite force.
  
Gallagher was acquitted of a murder charge in the stabbing death of an Islamic State militant captive, but a military jury convicted him of posing with the corpse while in Iraq in 2017. He was demoted from chief petty officer to a 1st class petty officer. Trump this month restored Gallagher’s rank.
  
In a statement issued by Hoffman, Esper said he had lost “trust and confidence” in Spencer after learning that the Navy secretary had “privately” proposed to the White House to allow Gallagher to retire in his current rank and without losing his status as a SEAL. Esper said that in previous conversations with Spencer about the Gallagher matter, Spencer had not told Esper of his proposal to the White House.
  
Esper faulted Spencer for a “lack of candor” on the matter.
  
A spokesperson for Spencer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  
Esper on Sunday directed that Gallagher be allowed to retire at the end of this month, and that the Navy review board that was scheduled to hear his case starting Dec. 2 be cancelled, Hoffman said. At Esper’s direction, Gallagher will be allowed to retire as a SEAL at his current rank, Hoffman said. He said Esper had concluded that Gallagher could not, under the circumstances, receive a fair shake from the Navy, and thus should be allowed to retire.
  
In the written statement, Esper said of Spencer: “I am deeply troubled by this conduct shown by a senior DOD official. Unfortunately, as a result I have determined that Secretary Spencer no longer has my confidence to continue in his position. I wish Richard well.""

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, ""That is why multi-billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg are not gonna get very far in this election.""
And Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said, ""Telling billionaires that they can just come and buy elections, that doesn't make a democracy work.""
Bloomberg, whose net worth is estimated at more than $50 billion, has committed at least $150 million of his fortune on the 2020 campaign.

His top campaign issues will be gun control and climate change.

On Friday, President Trump said bring it on, telling Fox News that ""he wants a trial,"" and that he knows the identity of the whistleblower. 
""Should the whistleblower be fired, Mr. President?"" a reporter asked. 
""What whistleblower? I don't think there is...,"" Trump replied. 
Democrats disagree crediting the whistleblower for the tip on the infamous July 25 call with Ukraine's president which sparked an impeachment inquiry. 
At the center of the allegations, the President froze aid to Ukraine to force an investigation into Joe Biden's son. 
Calling it a ""false report"", Trump told Fox News he wants the whistleblower to testify. 
""I know exactly who it is, everybody does,"" Trump said. 
""Is he still there?,"" the Fox News host asked.

""There is only one person I want more than Hunter Biden and that is Adam Schiff,"" Trump said. 
Schiff has brought in a wide range of witnesses including former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. 
""This ambassador that everybody says is so wonderful. She wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy. She wouldn't hang it. It took like a year and a half, or two years for her to get the picture up.

Will US-China trade talks – something the president has worked hard to negotiate with the leaders of the world's second largest economy – be jeopardized? China has threatened to take tough counter measures if Trump signs the Hong Kong measure.
Members of Congress sent a powerful signal to China Thursday by standing with the pro-democracy protestors of Hong Kong.

""If America does not speak up for human rights in China because of commercial issues, we lose all moral authority to speak about human rights anywhere in the world,"" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi insisted. 
At least 23 more protestors left Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Thursday after days of the worst anti-government violence since Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests began.  
""The protests have continued because the people of Hong Kong see what's coming. They see the steady effort to erode the autonomy and their freedoms,"" said US Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL).
 
Delaware Sen. Chris Coons (D) explained why he also supported the measure saying, ""The United States has long stood as a beacon of freedom and a country that supports and calls out to those who are demonstrating to their rights. We need to be a more forceful and effective voice in Hong Kong.""
The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is more than just symbolic – government officials responsible for violating human rights in Hong Kong could be subjected to tough sanctions including visa bans and the freezing of their assets in US banks.  Another bill approved by Congress suspends the sale of munitions to Hong Kong police.
China responded angrily. Meeting with former US Defense Secretary William Cohen in Beijing Thursday, China's foreign minister said the US move is ""a stark interference in China's internal affairs.""
But protestors say police have killed some of them, like the demonstrator who was shot point blank in the chest last week. Hong Kong police have also reportedly sprayed chemical-laced water on pro-democracy protestors.  
Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy says China President Xi Jinping is quickly becoming a pariah on the world stage. ""He is destroying one of the economic jewels of the world, but certainly one of the economic jewels of China."" 
Andrew Duncan, is co-producer of a Netflix documentary on Hong Kong's ""umbrella movement"". On this week's episode of the CBN News Channel program The Global Lane, he said President Trump needs to sign the bill despite the potential threat it may pose to a US-China trade deal.  
""We have yet to hear from the President of the United States and he needs to firmly speak out in defense of democracy, in my opinion, and firmly speak out in support of Hong Kong's rights under the joint resolution,"" he said.
It remains unclear if President Trump will sign the bill.

The former New York City mayor, who became a Democrat just last year, filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday to formally create a presidential campaign committee. The move legally allows him to begin raising and spending money on a 2020 campaign, although his team says he’s yet to make a final decision.
A formal announcement is expected in the coming days.
The 77-year-old Bloomberg is one of the richest people in the world. His estimated net worth exceeds $50 billion, and he’s already committed to spending more than $100 million to help defeat President Donald Trump in 2020 whether he runs or not.
Bloomberg’s enormous wealth, his ties to Wall Street, and his status as a former Republican could make it difficult for him to win support among traditional Democratic primary voters. Should he run, his advisers have charted an unconventional strategy that calls for him to bypass the first four states on the primary calendar and make an aggressive play for the so-called Super Tuesday states that vote in early March.
Before Thursday’s federal filing, he had already filed paperwork to qualify for presidential primary ballots in three states.
Bloomberg’s team says he’s stepping toward a run because of the perceived weakness at the top of the current Democratic field, particularly in establishment-favorite former Vice President Joe Biden’s candidacy.

Among a crowded stage of 10 Democrat candidates, it was President Trump who united them.

Sanders and Warren want Medicare for all, a plan criticized by Republicans and even some Democrats as too expensive and unrealistic. Biden argues the plan wouldn't make it out of Congress.
""The fact is the vast majority of Democrats do not support medical for all. It wouldn't pass the Senate right now,"" Biden said. 
The former vice president raised eyebrows and drew some laughter with his answer to a question about domestic violence.

Impeachment Take Two: Bribery, Not Quid Pro Quo
""I think today's testimony is among the most significant evidence to date,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters. 
Schiff claimed this as a very important moment for the impeachment inquiry.
""It was the conditioning of official acts for something of great value to the president, these political investigations,"" Schiff said. ""It goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery as well as other potential high crimes and misdemeanors. But we also have heard for the first time that knowledge of this scheme was pervasive.
While Republicans flag this point made repeatedly by Sondland.
When asked if the President ever told him about any preconditions for the aid to be released, Sondland replied, ""No.""
Sondland claimed he thought a quid pro quo existed, but not in regards to holding up aid.
""As I testified previously, Mr. Giuliani's requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelenskiy.  Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election, DNC server and Burisma. 
Sondland then eventually presumed the hold on security assistance played a part as well.
""That was my presumption yes,"" he told the committee, while still making it clear he never got a presidential directive.
""My testimony is I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on announcement on elections,"" Sondland said. 
And he also recounted a phone call with President Trump – he asked point-blank what Trump wanted from Ukraine.
""He said nothing. 'I want no quid pro quo. I just want Zelensky to do what he ran on,'"" the ambassador testified. 
Much like Tuesday's witnesses Sondland also testified, at the time, he did not equate investigating Burisma with the Bidens.
""It was always Burisma to me and I didn't know about the connection to Burisma and Biden,"" he told the committee. 
Republicans also questioned if it was really that unusual to hold up foreign aid.
Rep. Devin Nunes, (R-CA) said, ""President Trump doesn't like foreign aid to start with."" 
""I've heard that, yes,"" Sondland replied.
""Before a president can send foreign aid, there has to be certification that there was no corruption,"" Nune said.  
""I'm aware of that now,"" the ambassador answered. 
While leaving the White House Wednesday afternoon, President Trump read directly from a transcript of the day's testimony. 
""He asks me screaming, 'What do you want from Ukraine?'"" Trump read. 
Sondland: ""It was a very short abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood.""
""I'm always in a good mood. I don't know what that is,"" the President said as he continued reading. 
Sondland: ""I keep hearing all these different ideas, theories and this and that – what do you want?""
""And now here is my response that he gave, just gave… ready, you have the cameras rolling. I want nothing, that's what I want from Ukraine. I want nothing, I said it twice,"" Trump said. 
As the President insisted again he did nothing wrong, he pushed back on Sondland's testimony.
""I don't know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. Seems like a nice guy though,"" Trump said. 
But Wednesday that nice guy threatened to crack the impeachment inquiry wide open. Trump disagreed, calling for people to ""read the transcript"" and insisting the phone call was ""perfect.""
Then he says the final word from the President of the United States. I want nothing. Thank you. folks. Have a good time,"" the President told the assembled members of the media. 
The White House also released a statement saying ""Democrats are chasing ghosts"" and that Sondland's testimony only reiterated that Trump ""wanted nothing"" from Ukraine. "

“The passage of this bill is an important step in holding accountable those Chinese and Hong Kong government officials responsible for Hong Kong’s eroding autonomy and human rights violations,” said Rubio.
Earlier, he also tweeted his opposition to a full-blown China takeover of Hong Kong saying, ""If govt of #HongKong passes new national security laws that allow #Beijing to prosecute critics, it would be the de facto end of ""One Country, Two Systems"", a violation of every promise made during the handover & warrants U.S. immediately treating city same as mainland #China.""
The Senate bill now goes to the House of Representatives which has already passed similar legislation.
The Senate vote came after months of protest, and it angered Beijing which has threatened to take what it calls ""strong countermeasures"" if Congress passes the bill. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang blasted the US bill saying it was designed to “bolster anti-China, extremist and violent radicals who attempt to disrupt Hong Kong (and) damage Hong Kong's prosperity and stability” as part of a plot to contain China’s development.

That places Buttigieg solidly in the front-running group with Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. He's tried to position himself as a moderate on some issues, in contrast to the far-left policies of Warren and Sanders.

Now, as Warren did, Buttigieg is likely to face tougher scrutiny from the other candidates, along with voters and the political media.
CBN News chief political analyst, David Brody, says there’s no doubt the attacks in tonight’s debate will be aimed at Buttigieg.
“He reminds me of Barack Obama back in 2007…from a cadence perspective, from a generational perspective, from an uplifting perspective and boy, he’s able to kind of weave a narrative…and he’s brought in faith, Barack Obama brought in faith as well, and he’s able to do it in this kind of progressive, compassionate Matthew 25 type of gospel that we’ve heard before,” Brody said on the CBN News Podcast ""The Daily Rundown"".

Day three of the public testimony might have been the most interesting yet with the public finally hearing from witnesses who were directly involved with the phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenksy.
One of the more notable revelations came when Republicans hinted multiple times during questioning of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, that they believe he might be a whistleblower source.

""I spoke to two individuals with regards to providing some sort of readout of the call,"" Vindman said.
Vindman testified one of them was George Kent, but when asked a question about the second person by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) about what agency the individual was from, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff (D-CA) intervened.
""If I could interject here. We don't want to use these proceedings. We need to protect the whistleblower,"" the California Democrat said. 
Democrat objections leading Republicans to this question.
""You have said you don't know who the whistleblower is, so how is this outing the whistleblower if you don't know who it is?,"" asked Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio)
Both Vindman and Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Pence, acknowledged concerns while listening to the July 25 telephone call. 
""What was your real-time reaction to hearing that call?"" Schiff asked.
""Chairman, Without hesitation, I knew I had to report this to the White House counsel,"" Vindman responded. ""It was my duty to report my concerns. It was inappropriate. It was improper for the President to demand an investigation into a political opponent.""
""I found the July 25 call unusual,"" Williams testified. 
Vindman testified, however, he didn't view moving the call to a secure server as ""anything nefarious."" 
""This is definitely not unprecedented,"" Vindman told the committee.
Both of the witnesses denied Trump's accusations they are ""never Trumpers.""
....that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt. She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!

""It certainly surprised me,"" Williams said. ""I was not expected to be called out by name.""
""I'd call myself ""never partisan,"" Vindman said. 
Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) questioned Speaker Nancy Pelosi's claims that the House's investigation is about bribery.  
""The word bribery appears in these 3,500 pages one time. It appears in the description of Vice President Biden's conduct,"" the congressman said. 
""The reason we don't ask fact witnesses to make a judgment about whether a crime of bribery has been committed is, you're fact witnesses,"" Schiff responded. ""It will be our job to decide whether the impeachable act of bribery has occurred. That's why we don't ask you those questions.""
In the afternoon, Republicans finally got the chance to bring forth two witnesses of their own – Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison, both former administration officials. 
""In hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating..""Burisma,"" as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different –the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable,"" Volker testified. 
Morrison and Volker both say they were never asked to bribe or extort anyone.
""I was never involved in anything I considered to be bribery at all or extortion,"" Morrison said. 
 
""Did anything concern you on the call?,"" GOP Counsel Steve Castor asked Morrison. 
Morrison simply replied, ""No.""
Meanwhile, President Trump said look the impeachment started even before he became commander-in-chief. On Tuesday, he pushed back on testimony that he did anything wrong.
Trump said he doesn't know Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a man who listened in on the infamous July 25 call.
""All these people are talking about they heard a conversation about a conversation of another conversation that was had by the president. What's going on is a disgrace and it's an embarrassment to our nation,"" Trump said. 
Trump has repeatedly called for people to ""read the transcript"" insisting the call was ""perfect.""
""If anybody reads the transcripts, I had two calls with the President of Ukraine, by the way, said that there was no pressure whatsoever,"" the President said.  
During the House's second week of public testimony, the President pushed policy form the Cabinet Room at the White House
""In the meantime, we can't get USMCA approved because Nancy Pelosi is grossly incompetent,"" he said.  
....that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt. She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!

Trump has indicated he may be willing to testify at the impeachment hearing. On Monday, he tweeted he might offer written testimony: ""She also said I could do it in writing.

Meanwhile, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) told Fox News the upcoming report from Inspector General Michael Horowitz on how the Russia collusion investigation got started could be bad news for many in Washington.
""The Democrats are racing to get through this impeachment as quickly as possible,"" Ratcliffe said. ""That's why we had eight witnesses in five hearings this week and we're not doing any of the work is because they know that that inspector general's report is likely to be damning about the origins of the 2016 investigation into the Trump campaign, and the role that the Obama-Biden officials played in that.""
Critics of the Russia investigation have argued it originated with a ""deep state"" attempt to undermine Trump that they believe was initiated under the Obama administration.
That report is expected to be released to the public soon.
Horowitz told Congress in a letter last month that he did not expect a lengthy review period and that he intended to make as much of the report public as possible, with minimal redactions.
""A number of people who were mentioned in the report are having an opportunity right now to comment on how they're quoted in the report,"" Attorney General William Barr said at a news conference in Memphis, Tennessee last week. ""And after that process is over, which should be very short, the report will be issued.""
Horowitz's team has reviewed over one million records and conducted more than 100 interviews, including several who were interviewed in the last few months, the inspector general has told Congress."

For months, former Vice President Joe Biden held the lead in Iowa, which is the first contest for Democrat candidates seeking their party's nomination. Now South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in first place in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll for the state.
Buttigieg has 25 percent and Elizabeth Warren is close behind at 22 percent. Biden has steadily slipped in the polls in recent weeks, even though he was once thought to be the most likely pick for the party, falling to 15 percent where he's now tied with socialist candidate Bernie Sanders.

Buttigieg's Anti-Christian Controversy
Buttigieg has been controversial for his extreme attacks on the Christian faith of Vice President Mike Pence. Earlier this year, Buttigieg, who is married to another man, compared Christians to Islamic extremists because of their biblical beliefs about sexuality.
But recently, he tried to appeal to Christian voters by claiming he'd do a better job of showing what real Christianity is like if he's sent to the White House.
Biden Aims for the Middle, Opposes Marijuana
Buttigieg may be surging in Iowa, but a new poll shows Biden holds a commanding lead in the South Carolina primary contest.
Biden has tried to position himself as the more moderate candidate. He just made headlines for explaining that he wouldn't support legalizing marijuana if he is elected president. 
""The truth of the matter is, there's not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,"" the Business Insider reports Biden saying.
""It's a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it,"" he added.
New Democrat Joins Presidential Race
Meanwhile, another Democrat just recently joined the 2020 presidential race. 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is a late-comer to the primary race but said, ""You can't know if you can break through unless you get out and try,"" CBS News reports.
Patrick, who is a close friend of former President Barack Obama, said in his announcement video, ""This won't be easy and it shouldn't be. But I'm placing my faith in the people who feel left out and left-back, who just want a fair shot at a better future. Not built by somebody better than you, not built for you, but built with you."" 
Despite saying that he ""respects the Democratic candidate,"" he appeared to condemn Biden and Warren when he said, ""We seem to be migrating on the one camp toward nostalgia...and on the other camp it's 'our big idea or no way.'""
No Breakaway Candidate - Field Open for Bloomberg?
With no breakaway candidate emerging after almost an entire year, some pundits say it's clear Democrats are unhappy with their field of candidates. That's why New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg is also rumored to be considering joining the race. 
The former New York City mayor has not formally announced his run for the presidency, but Jason Schechter, a spokesman for Bloomberg said, ""The only candidate Mike is trying to stop is Donald Trump.""
Bloomberg is already taking on Trump, pouring $100 million into an online advertising campaign attacking the president. The campaign will run in four battleground states: Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. One example of a new ad shows a picture of the president's Twitter page, with the caption ""a tweet shouldn't threaten our national security.""
Jumping into the political fray, Bloomberg apologized recently for defending NYPD's controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy. The policy allowed police to stop people on the street and frisk them if there was cause to believe a crime had been committed or was about to occur. 
Bloomberg acknowledged that the policy led to ""far too many innocent people"" being stopped - many were black and Latino. ""The erosion of that trust bothered me,"" Bloomberg said. ""And I want to earn it back. Today, I want you to know that I realize that I was wrong. And I'm sorry.
Then, There's Hillary - Will She Run?
Then there's Hillary Clinton who has said she's been strongly urged to join the race too.

According to the BBC, Clinton said that she would ""never say never,"" and that she is ""under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it.""
""I think all the time about what kind of president I would have been. Whoever wins next time is going to have a big task trying to fix everything that's been broken,"" she added.

0,2019-11-17T07:00:00-05:00,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/november/democrat-edwards-wins-reelection-in-conservative-louisiana,Democrat Edwards Wins Reelection in Conservative Louisiana,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Deep in the heart of the conservative South, Louisiana’s voters reelected Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards to a second term, shocking Republicans who had hoped to reclaim the seat on the strength of President Donald Trump’s popularity.
With his focus on bipartisan, state-specific issues, the moderate Edwards cobbled together enough cross-party support Saturday to defeat Republican businessman Eddie Rispone, getting about 51% of the vote.
Trump fought to return the seat to the GOP, but his intense interest in the race not only motivated conservative Republicans, but also powered a surge in anti-Trump and black voter turnout that helped boost Edwards over the finish line.
Coming after a defeat in the Kentucky governor’s race and sizable losses in Virginia’s legislative races, the Louisiana result seems certain to rattle Republicans heading into the 2020 presidential election. Trump made three trips to Louisiana to rally against Edwards, and fashioned the runoff election between Edwards and Rispone into a test of his own popularity and political prowess.
In a victory rally of his own late Saturday, Edwards thanked supporters who danced, sang and cheered in celebration, while he declared, “How sweet it is!”
He added, “And as for the president, God bless his heart” — a phrase often used by genteel Southerners to politely deprecate someone.
“Tonight the people of Louisiana have chosen to chart their own path,” Edwards said.
As he conceded the race, Rispone called on supporters to give a round of applause for Trump, saying: “That man loves America and he loves Louisiana.”
Democrats who argue that nominating a moderate presidential candidate is the best approach to beat Trump are certain to say Louisiana’s race bolsters their case.
Still, while Rispone’s loss raises questions about the strength of Trump’s coattails, its relevance to his reelection chances are less clear. Louisiana is expected to easily back Trump next year, and Edwards’ views are, in many ways, out of step with his own party.
A West Point graduate and former Army Ranger, Edwards opposes most gun restrictions, signed one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans and dismissed the impeachment effort as a distraction.
Meanwhile, Rispone, 70, wasn’t among the top-tier candidates Republican leaders hoped would challenge Edwards. He had ties to the unpopular former Gov. Bobby Jindal, started with little name recognition and offered few details about his agenda.
Edwards, 53, also proved to be a formidable candidate, with a record of achievements.
Working with the majority-Republican Legislature, Edwards stabilized state finances with a package of tax increases, ending the deficit-riddled years of Jindal. New money paid for investments in public colleges and the first statewide teacher raise in a decade.
Edwards expanded Louisiana’s Medicaid program, lowering the state’s uninsured rate below the national average. A bipartisan criminal sentencing law rewrite he championed ended Louisiana’s tenure as the nation’s top jailer.
Rispone, the owner of a Baton Rouge industrial contracting company, hitched his entire candidacy to Trump, introducing himself to voters in ads that focused on support for the president in a state Trump won by 20 percentage points. Rispone said he was like Trump, describing himself as a “conservative outsider” whose business acumen would help solve the state’s problems.
The president’s repeated visits appeared to drive turnout for both candidates.
Tour guide Andrea Hartman, 40, cast her ballot for Edwards in New Orleans.
“I do not agree with what Rispone advocates,” she said. “I also don’t want Trump coming here and telling me who to vote for.”
Rispone poured more than $12 million of his own money into the race. But he had trouble drawing some of the primary vote that went to Republican U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, after harshly attacking Abraham in ads as he sought to reach the runoff. He also avoided many traditional public events attended by Louisiana gubernatorial candidates and sidestepped questions about his plans. He promised tax cuts without saying where he’d shrink spending, and pledged a constitutional convention without detailing what he wanted to rewrite.
“We have nothing to be ashamed of. We had over 700,000 people in Louisiana who really want something better, something different,” Rispone said.

Case in point, Thursday night's rally in Louisiana.   
He told those attending, ""These crazed lunatics, the Democrats, the radical Left, and their media partners are pushing the deranged impeachment witch hunt…for (me) doing nothing wrong.  Doing nothing wrong.  You know, we did nothing wrong, and they're doing nothing.""
Trump predicted the process won't end well for the Democrats, saying, ""But once again, their lies will be exposed, just like the last times.""
 
The President let the crowd know all these attacks on him are hurting his family.
""Impeachment to me is a dirty word,"" he said. ""But it's been very unfair, very hard on my family.  Me…it's my whole life, it's crazy…what a life I lead!  You think this is fun, don't you?  But it's been very hard on my family.  Very, very hard.""
 
Adding to that pain, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi notched it up to a higher level, accusing the president of a crime the US Constitution calls impeachable.  
Pelosi said to reporters, ""We haven't even made a decision to impeach.  That's what the inquiry is about.   And when the committees decide that, they will decide what the articles (of impeachment) are.   But I am saying that what the president has admitted to and says it's perfect…I said it's perfectly wrong – it's bribery.""
Trump shot back at the speaker, tweeting ""Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who should be home cleaning up the dangerous & disgusting Slum she is making of her District in San Francisco, where even the filth pouring into the Pacific Ocean is rapidly becoming an environmental hazard, is getting NOTHING DONE.""  
Trump didn't let up Friday afternoon, when he expressed fury with Democrat-created rules that have limited what Republicans can do in the hearings.      
""I think it's considered a joke all over Washington and all over the world,"" he said. ""The Republicans are given no due process whatsoever.   We're not allowed to do anything. It's a disgrace what's happening.  But you know what?  The American public understands it. And that's why the poll numbers are so good.""
The President then blasted the news media's coverage of the impeachment process and his presidency, calling the press ""unbelievably dishonest.""
And he said that's why the mainstream media are seeing their lowest approval ratings in the history of the country.

At a Keep America Great rally in Louisiana Thursday night, President Trump criticized the testimony of the first two witnesses to appear at the impeachment hearings. The president blasted the Democrats for leading what he calls a “deranged inpeachment witchhunt.”

While day one of public testimony was long and drawn out with little new information, there was revelation of another phone call.
US diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor and senior State Department official George Kent both testified that Trump ordered nearly $400 million in military aid withheld from Ukraine for political purposes.

Then came that revelation from Taylor. He said one of his staffers overheard EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland on the phone with Trump.
 
""The member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine,"" Taylor said in his opening statement. ""Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of the Bidens.""
Trump said he didn't remember the conversation.
""I know nothing about that. First time I've heard of it,"" he said in a news conference. ""The one thing I've seen that Sondland said is that he did speak to me for a brief moment and I said no quid pro quo under any circumstances. And that's true.""
On the Biden corruption front, Kent said he was concerned about the role of Hunter Biden, son of then Vice President Joe Biden, at a Ukrainian gas company.
""There was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,"" said Kent in an answer to a lawmaker.
In the hearing, Republicans focused on the end result, namely that the White House did release military aid to Ukraine and there was no investigation of the Bidens. They also noted that Taylor and Kent relied on secondhand information.
CBN's chief political analyst David Brody said one theme stuck out to him on Wednesday.
""One word – hearsay,"" he told CBN's Faith Nation. ""We heard it all the time. If we're going to play this game of telephone, I heard it from that person who heard it from that person, now we're into fourth hand. What in the world does that mean exactly?""
Taylor's staffer who says he heard that call will now testify privately on Friday. Marie Yavanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, will also take the stand – though publicly – that same day.

Mutiny in the West Wing: Nikki Haley Says She Was Asked to Join a Revolt Against President Trump
Cameras crowded the top US diplomats to Ukraine, who under oath revealed their previously disclosed testimony in public for the first time. 
Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said that ""what we will witness today is a televised theatrical performance.""
Thanking witnesses William Taylor, the US ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, Nunes said, ""I'd like to congratulate you for passing the Democrats' star chamber auditions held for the last weeks in the basement of the Capitol.""
During the hearing, Ambassador Taylor added a new revelation to his previous testimony, adding that ""at the time I gave my first deposition on October 22 I was not aware of this information."" 
Taylor said a staffer at a restaurant with Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, heard President Trump speaking over the phone with Sondland. 
""A member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about the investigations. Ambassador Sondland told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward,"" said Taylor. 
Taylor said ""investigations"" was a term ""used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to investigations of Burisma and the Bidens.""
""I had come to understand well before then that investigations was a term ambassadors Kurt Volker and Sondland used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to investigations of Burisma and the Bidens,"" Taylor said.
Taylor described a visit to the frontline of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that came after President Trump's now-infamous July phone call with Zelensky.
""Russian-led forces continue to kill Ukrainians in the war one or two a week,"" said Taylor. 
An hour into the hearing the President retweeted a video from the official White House Twitter account that declared ""New hoax. Same swamp.""
""It's a witch hunt, it's a hoax,"" said President Trump in the Oval Office during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  
Dismissing the ongoing hearings, the President said, ""I'm too busy to watch it. I have not been briefed.""
On the Biden corruption front, Deputy Assistant Secretary George P. Kent said he was concerned over former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter's role at a Ukrainian gas company. 
""There was the possibility of a perception of a conflict of interest,"" Kent said.  
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Taylor's own testimony made no linkage between US aid to Ukraine and any investigation. 
""There was discussion of the security assistance but no linkage,"" said Taylor.
For their part, Republicans pressed home their point that the testimony of the career service officers was not firsthand. 
""They could be wrong, or they could be mistaken, or they could have heard it incorrectly, right Ambassador Taylor?"" asked Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio).
""People make mistakes,"" said Taylor."

Newswatch is seen weekdays on the CBN News Channel.  For a programming schedule, click here. 
Despite the impeachment inquiry hearings going public on Wednesday, few political analysts believe the Democrats will be able to remove President Trump from office. 
Conservative radio host Todd Starnes says the effort will die in the Senate.

America Hears Impeachment Testimony for First Time
During an interview airing on CBN's Newswatch on Wednesday, Starnes reminded viewers the Democrats have been trying to impeach the President since the day after he got elected. 
""We document this,"" he said. ""It's all out there for public consumption. The Washington Post on the day of the inauguration actually had a column talking about how the impeachment of the President started right then and there. So this is not a big surprise here.""
""Look, it's going to get nasty between now and Election Day next November,"" Starnes noted. ""And I think the average American voter needs to understand this is all about politics. The President has done nothing wrong. If you actually read the transcripts, you understand that this guy is not a whistleblower, he is a leaker. And beyond that, this is a guy who has very close ties for the Obama administration.""
""So again, we're talking about deep state collusion to take down a duly elected President of these great United States,"" he continued. 
CBN News asked Starnes if he thought Republicans would stand with the President. 
""I have no doubt Sen. Lindsey Graham will hold the line in the Senate. No doubt about that,"" the radio host replied. ""I have no doubt the House Freedom Caucus will hold ground in the House of Representatives.""
""Do I think this President will be convicted?"" Starnes asked. ""I don't believe so. I don't see any kind of a game plan or movement where a majority of Republicans in the Senate would join the Democrats to convict the President. So this is all about embarrassing the President. This is about besmirching his good name. Every American is going to see what the Democrats are trying to do here.""
When asked about another Democrats' strategy, possible going after Trump's fitness to serve, Starnes laughed about the Democrats' new scheme.
""Here's the new scheme,"" he said chuckling. ""They want the American people to think he's looney. He's crazy. He's off his rocker. As we say back home in Tennessee, 'The front porch lights on, but nobody's home'.""  
""Look, come on. This is outrageous,"" Starnes added. ""The average American voter understands this President has all of his mental faculties about him.  Here's something for all of the viewers to consider.  Over the weekend, President Trump was at the LSU-Alabama football game. The massive applause and cheers that this president received. Now had there been boos, there would have been wall-to-wall national news coverage. But because you had more than 100,000 people cheering this president, the mainstream media ignored it, because it goes against their narrative that the American people are wary or maybe they don't like this president or his agenda or his tweets."" 
""I don't believe that's the case,"" the radio host continued. ""And I believe what we saw happen in Alabama at that football game is representative of the general feeling of the American people at large."""

CBN News recently spoke to religious freedom advocate Virginia Prodan, author of Saving My Assassin, who narrowly escaped death after Romania's dictator Nicolae Ceausescu sent an assassin to kill her when she took his regime to court for persecuting Christians. 
With a gun pointed at her head, five-foot-tall Virginia led her would-be assassin to Christ and is now sharing her story, and warning Americans about the dangers of socialism.

Prodan explains that the Romanian government at that time wanted her dead because she defended Christian and human rights cases.
""The socialist government will establish a system where the government is your God, not Christ. It will have everything appointed to Christians to persecute them,"" she explains. ""What I did is defend Christians who had a Bible in their home or shared the Bible with others.""
Prodan says she's been shocked to hear liberal American politicians promoting socialism in recent years.
""I wonder, 'Am I dreaming, am I back in Romania?' It's impossible. It's not America. It's the same type of lies that I heard my parents were told in order to give them the vote for the socialists to be in power,"" she recalls.

The televised testimonies of two witnesses are taking place while Republicans attempt to have their own witnesses come forward. 
The ""he said, she said"" elements central to this impeachment inquiry can be hard to follow and both sides are adding more fuel to the fire. Democrats released new transcripts from closed-door proceedings only hours before the new hearings. The president's allies' main contention remains that the evidence does not add up to impeachment. 
The new transcripts are from October 23, the day Republicans dramatically stormed into a closed-door hearing when the Pentagon official in charge of Ukraine testified the president directed aid to Ukraine be frozen while he asked the country to investigate its internal corruption.
""There was no investigation and the aid flowed as it was supposed to,"" former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley says, maintaining that even if the president tried to pursue a quid pro quo – it didn't happen. 
MY FAITH VOTES Calls for Prayer: Impeachment Process and Christians Call to Prayer Guide
Meanwhile, the impeachment hearings are now on full public display, broadcast live on networks, cable channels and the internet. 
First up – acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor who texted Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, that it would be ""crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""
Then comes diplomat George Kent who said behind closed doors that the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani ran a ""campaign of slander"" and ""lies"" to oust former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.  
Later in the week, the House hears from Fiona Hill, the former national security council official who said in her testimony that former National Security Advisor John Bolton was so distraught over a July 10th White House meeting with Ukrainian officials that he abruptly ended a meeting in his office. 
The public proceedings come after acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney admitted and then denied a ""quid pro quo,"" saying it wasn't anything unusual. ""We do that all the time with foreign policy,"" he said. 
Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) defends Trump saying, ""The president asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival."" Kennedy said Sunday President Trump's desire to withhold aid could be lawful. 
Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) agrees, saying, ""Foreign aid by law can only go out to countries that are not corrupt."" 
Paul echoed that assessment, adding that Republicans should be allowed to bring witnesses of their own to the circus. 
""If you can't call Hunter Biden and if you can't call the whistleblower, that's not, that's sort of a sham, that's not even really a trial,"" Paul continued. 
A big fish for Democrats in the impeachment inquiry is Mick Mulvaney. But Tuesday he said he would not comply with a subpoena. "

When CBN News first met 24-year-old Devinn Smart outside the White House, one thing became perfectly clear. ""I believe that President Donald Trump is going to win 2020 by a landslide,"" he told us. 
His view wasn't always this way. Hardly. He grew up in a family of die-hard Democrats and attended a historically black university in Hampton, Virginia.

'Great Discussion and Celebration': Faith Leaders Pray for Trump at White House
While at college, Devinn started researching Trump for himself and a specific line resonated with him when the candidate was making his appeal to black voters. ""What the h*** do you have to lose?"" Trump exclaimed back then. Devinn was listening intently. ""I was just looking at his policies and the things that he said he was going to do and I said, 'Ok, I'm starting to like this guy'… but I was scared to say it out loud because I know I was going to get judged."" 
While he didn't vote in 2016, soon after Trump became president, Devinn ""outed"" himself on Twitter as a full-fledged Trump supporter, complete with a ""Make America Great Again"" hat. 
""The Democratic Party has been manipulating the black community for over fifty years and I was simply tired of it,"" Devinn tells CBN News. 
The insults came quickly. ""I've been called a coon, a bootlicker, an 'Uncle Tom'… all of these derogatory terms all because I support the president.""
More fallout was on the way. Twice he's been asked to preach at spiritual revival conferences in Virginia. And twice he's been disinvited. 
""The pastor called me and said, unless you go on your Twitter and say that you do not support the president, I can not invite you here,"" Smart told CBN News. ""I said, 'Tell me where in the Bible does it say that I can not preach at your church because I support the president?' He said, 'Well, there are a lot of people at my church who don't support the president and they would be very upset with me if you come so I have to take away your invitation'."" 
Devinn says that made no sense from a spiritual perspective. ""My job, when I'm standing behind that sacred desk is to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  And for you to tell me I can't come and preach at, not your church but the Lord's church, because I support the president? Now, are you living by the principles of the Bible? That was my question.""
The pastor abruptly hung up the phone, but Devinn still remains dialed in for Trump. He says he's not been disappointed: A historically low unemployment rate for African-Americans, a groundbreaking prison reform law, and allocating a record amount of federal money to historically black colleges. 
Those achievements may be paying political dividends. In 2016, Trump won eight percent of the black vote. A new poll shows him with almost double that now at 15 percent. 
Devinn came to the White House in October as part of the Black Leadership Summit. As a Christian, he experienced something pretty cool. It started when talking to a friend before the event. ""She said, 'I would love to pray at the White House.' So at the end (of the event), me and her both said, 'Hey President Trump, can we pray?' And he pointed at me and said come up and pray but she had just told me that she had a dream about praying at the White House. I looked at her and said, 'Go ahead'."" She went up on stage and prayed – a prayer that has since gone viral. 
As for Devinn's journey, he's been through a lot for publicly supporting the president. He tells me many more like him are still out there but they operate in stealth mode.  
""I had over 100 messages on my Twitter of people saying, 'Devinn, I support the president but I'm not as strong as you to come out and say it in public.' …I have a lot of people who support President Donald Trump but they won't say it. It's secret. They're going to vote for him in 2020. I'm telling you they are."" The Trump Campaign is sure hoping Devinn Smart is, ""brilliant"" in his prediction.  "

Peter King Retiring, Giving Dems New 2020 Target","WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Peter King, a moderate Republican who has represented a Long Island congressional district for nearly 30 years, announced Monday he won't seek reelection, presenting Democrats with a fresh suburban target as they defend their majority in 2020.
The decision comes days after voters flocked to Democratic candidates in state elections in Kentucky and Virginia, underscoring Republican vulnerability in a suburban revolt against President Donald Trump.
But in the latest indication that congressional Republicans are rallying behind Trump for now, King said he will oppose Democratic efforts to impeach Trump. King also opposed Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998.
""In the coming weeks and during the next year I intend to vote against President Trump's impeachment and will support the President's bid for re-election,"" King said.
The 14-term congressman, 75, said in a Facebook post that he's retiring because he wants ""flexibility to spend more time"" with his children and grandchildren ""after 28 years of spending 4 days a week in Washington, D.C.""
King, a former chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, has cultivated a reputation for bipartisanship while maintaining a hard line on immigration and crime. He is the longest-serving Republican member of New York's congressional delegation. Still, he won reelection in 2018 by just 6 percentage points.
King's keen political instincts and deserved reputation as a fighter for New York's interests gave him remarkable political resiliency; at one point, after the 2008 election that sent Barack Obama to the White House, he was the state's lone GOP member of Congress.
He teamed up with powerful Democrats such as Chuck Schumer to win a huge Superstorm Sandy aid package after the 2012 storm, despite foot-dragging by GOP leaders. On Monday, the Senate Democratic leader took to Twitter to lavish praise on King.
""Peter King stood head & shoulders above everyone else,"" Schumer wrote. ""He's fiercely loved America, Long Island, and his Irish heritage and left a lasting mark on all 3.""
His district includes once-reliably GOP territory in southwestern Suffolk County and a portion of Nassau County, about an hour's drive east of Manhattan. It went narrowly for Trump in 2016.
Democrats seem certain to target the district in 2020. Many suburban districts around the country have been moving steadily toward Democrats as moderate, well-educated voters swing away from the polarizing president.
Twenty House Republicans have announced they will not seek reelection. Three other GOP lawmakers have resigned and already left Congress.
House Democrats retook the majority in 2018, and are looking to defend their majority and grab new seats in suburban districts in what they see as a backlash against Trump.
Only a handful of the Republican-held districts being vacated by retirements are expected to be seriously competitive next year. But King's district will be one of them, underscoring GOP vulnerability in suburban areas, spotlighted last week as suburban voters in Virginia and Kentucky flocked to Democratic candidates in elections for state offices.

Haley alleges in her new memoir that two former Trump administration officials, who were ultimately pushed out by President Trump, tried to get her to join their revolt against his policies.
In her book, she writes that the two told her they weren't being insubordinate, but they claimed ""it was their decisions, not the president's that were in the best interests of the country."" Haley says then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly were following a ""dangerous path.""
She told CBS, ""Instead of saying that to me, they should have been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan. It should have been, go tell the president what your differences are and quit if you don't like what he's doing.""
Kelly responded to the book, saying that what Haley terms resistance, he saw as developing a process to give the president enough information to make an informed decision.
And, as the Democrats are taking their impeachment hearings public this week, Haley also says she doesn't believe they'll succeed.
""No, on what? You're going to impeach the president for asking for a favor that didn't happen and giving money and it wasn't withheld? I don't know what you would impeach him on,"" Haley told CBS. ""Impeachment is like the death penalty for a public official. When you look at that transcript, there's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president.""
The televised hearings begin Wednesday. Expected to appear first: William Taylor, a former diplomat to Ukraine, who testified earlier that millions in military aid would be withheld unless there was an investigation into the president's political rival.
Democrats have shut down Republican requests to hear from former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden who was hired and paid millions by a Ukrainian energy company in what some suspect was a quid pro quo with the Obama White House.

One year ago, the 47-year-old abruptly announced her resignation as US ambassador to the United Nations. She offered no reason for leaving but called her time at the UN a ""blessing.""
Haley has dismissed actions by House Democrats to impeach Trump after they claime he pressured Ukraine's president to investigate his political opponent, Joe Biden.

""The Ukrainians never did the investigation and the president released the funds. I mean, when you look at those, there's just nothing impeachable there,"" she said. ""And more than that, I think the — the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why do we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?""
""You're going to impeach a president for asking for a favor that didn't happen and — and giving money and it wasn't withheld?"" Haley said. ""I don't know what you would impeach him on. Impeachment is, like, the death penalty for a public official.""
The White House released the transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president in an effort to provide transparency as House Democrats accused Trump of committing a crime worthy of impeachment.
""When you look at the transcript, there's nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president,"" Haley adds.

Also, Haley writes in a new her book, With All Due Respect, that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly tried to sabotage Trump in order to ""save the country,"" according to CNBC.
""Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country.""
""It was their decisions, not the president's, that were in the best interests of America, they said. The president didn't know what he was doing,"" Haley wrote about the two advisers.
In her book, Haley mentioned that advisors have an obligation to carry out the president's agenda —  and if they strongly disagree then they should leave.
""To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing. And it goes against the Constitution, and it goes against what the American people want. And it was offensive,"" she added."

The surprise call came three months before the infamous July 25 conversation that sparked the impeachment inquiry.
""Now they want my first call with the president of Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""If they want it I will probably give it to them but I don't like doing it because it sets a bad precedent.""
This announcement came as Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney ignored subpoenas to appear on Capitol Hill Friday.
""I don't want to give credibility to a corrupt witch hunt,"" Trump said. ""I'd love to have Mick go up. Frankly, I think he would do great.""
As he left for a trip to Georgia, the President dismissed any significance of testimony that has been released thus far.
Regardless, Democrats are preparing for their first publicly-televised impeachment hearing.
""We are very much looking forward to these witnesses next week raising the right hands going under oath and telling the American people about this shakedown scheme,"" said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA).
Three diplomats who've already testified behind closed doors were invited to go public.
Bill Taylor, George Kent, and Marie Yovanovitch will likely be asked to discuss their understanding of events before and after that July 25 call.
Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, testified before the panel on Wednesday.  Williams was one of the people listening to the call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.  Her testimony stretched out over four hours. 
Meanwhile, Pence spoke in New Jersey and said it's clear Trump did nothing wrong. 
""You know the American people have the transcript of the President's call and they can see there was no quid pro quo and the president did nothing wrong,"" the vice president said.  ""The President's focus has been, as my focus was with my meetings with President Zelensky to support President Zelensky's efforts to deal with a historic pattern of corruption in Ukraine."""

That's the big question many prominent Democrats are asking. Former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg isn't convinced they can and he's opening the door for his own shot.
The left-leaning billionaire has had quite a political journey over the years. ""I've been a Democrat. I've been a Republican and I eventually became an independent,"" Bloomberg said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention where he spoke in support of Hillary Clinton.
For weeks, the 77-year-old has been talking with influential Democrats expressing concerns about the steadiness of Joe Biden's campaign and the rise of left-wing Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
A long-time critic of President Trump, now Bloomberg is taking steps to get his name on the Alabama primary ballot which has a deadline of today.
Howard Wolfson, a top adviser for Bloomberg says the former mayor considers the president an ""unprecedented threat to our nation"" and says, ""Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well-positioned"" to defeat Trump.
""Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice and we can't afford to make that choice,"" Bloomberg said during his 2016 DNC speech.
He has experience running the largest city in America and has dedicated his influence and some of his fortune to promoting gun control laws and climate change initiatives.

As a moderate he would pose a threat to Biden, but his deep ties to Wall Street could motivate loyal supporters of Warren and Sanders who likely wouldn't take well to a billionaire blocking their agenda. 
He would also face an uphill battle winning over the party's powerful black constituency after defending the New York City Police Department's controversial ""stop and frisk"" policy which has been criticized as unfairly targeting African Americans and Hispanics.
Still, as Biden falls in the polls, some Democratic leaders and independent analysts think Warren and Sanders are too liberal to beat the president.
Bloomberg's step towards entering the race comes as polling shows the president remains very strong in key swing states needed to win the electoral college. "

Trump and Duck Dynasty's Phil and Willie Robertson Campaign in Louisiana,"President Donald Trump hit the campaign trail again Wednesday night, traveling to Monroe, Louisiana to support Republican businessman Eddie Rispone's effort to unseat the Democratic incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards.
This Louisiana runoff election for the governorship is being seen as a chance for Republicans to score a victory against Democrats in the Deep South after this week's GOP losses in Virginia.
""You're going out to replace a radical, liberal Democrat as your governor,"" Trump said.
He also took on other subjects including Joe Biden and trade with China. And referring to constant attacks against him, like the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives, he continued, ""The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, smears, slanders and scams.""
""The Democrats' shameful conduct has created an angry majority, and that's what we are, we're a majority - and we're angry - that will vote the 'do nothing Democrats' out of office in 2020, especially, we're going to take back the House. And we're going to focus on those 36 Democrats in Trump areas, areas that I won by a lot. I didn't run in 2018, you know they keep forgetting,"" Trump said.
The president also introduced two of the state's famous reality TV stars: Phil and Willie Robertson of Duck Dynasty.
Phil Robertson told the crowd, ""I got it down to this. If you're pro-God and pro-America and pro-gun and pro-duck hunting, that's all I want.""
Willie Robertson chimed in, """"Well, I don't know what else to say after following Phil and the president and Eddie, but thank you guys so much. You have been such a great community to share life with... to worship with. And I'm so tickled to be here with the president that he actually came down to our community. And let's go, Eddie!""
The president will return to Louisiana next Thursday to again campaign for the Republican governor candidate two days before the election takes place.

The hearings kick off Wednesday, and while all three witnesses have already talked to investigators, this will be the first time the American public hears from them firsthand.
Bill Taylor, the Acting US Ambassador to Ukraine, will be the first to take the stand. He told investigators that Trump withheld millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. Taylor's transcript also reveals he sent a cable to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo but got no response.
""The most important facts are largely not contested,"" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters Wednesday.
President Trump shot back later that night at a campaign rally in Monroe, Louisiana. ""Democrats must be accountable for their hoaxes and for their crimes,"" he said. ""Really, do you believe what is going on in Washington with these do-nothing, somewhat evil, in some cases very evil, people?""
Also testifying next week are Marie Yovanovitch, the former Ukrainian ambassador, and George Kent, a top State Department official.
Trump's defenders say none of this rises to the level of impeachment. ""There are perfectly appropriate quid pro quos and there are inappropriate quid pro quos,"" explained Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA)
Along those lines, supporters say Trump withheld aid from Ukraine while he was working to ensure that the government receiving the aid wasn't marred by corruption. CBN Founder Pat Robertson said on Thursday's 700 Club there's clearly nothing wrong with trying to make sure US aid isn't being given to a corrupt government.
This all comes as a new book written by an ""anonymous"" White House aide is set to come out. The Huffington Post reports the book claims White House officials made a list of Cabinet secretaries who would support using the 25th Amendment to remove the President in the days after he fired former FBI Director James Comey. These officials also believed Vice President Pence would back it up, a claim Pence's office refuted, calling it ""fake news.""
The White House is dismissing the hearings. At the same time though, it's beefing up its defense by hiring two longtime Trump allies to help with strategy.
Meanwhile, a majority of Americans think President Trump will win back the White House come 2020. That's according to a new Politico-Morning Consult survey.
It finds 56 percent of voters expect the president will be re-elected next year. If you break it down by political affiliation, 85 percent of Republicans think Trump will remain in office. A slight majority of independents - 51 percent - feel the same. Even a third of Democrats - 35 percent - think the president will be re-elected.

These lifetime appointments will impact the federal judiciary for decades to come on big issues like abortion to religious rights.
""A truly momentous achievement,"" Trump said. ""They will uphold our Constitution as written. These distinguished men and women are some of the most gifted scholars, respected jurists, and finest legal minds ever placed on the federal bench.""

Of the 179 positions on the circuit court, 43 are occupied by President Trump's nominees. Four seats are currently open with five more expected to become vacant soon. 
In comparison, President Obama nominated 55 circuit judges during his entire 8 years in office.
""Percentage wise you'll never beat one man and you know who that is, George Washington, 100%,"" said Trump. ""But in terms of, I would like to say quality and quantity, we are going to be just about number one by the time we finish.""
But confirming these nominees hasn't always been easy. 
Democrats and liberal groups have ramped up their opposition against conservatives, like Amy Coney Barrett who was criticized for her Catholic faith.
And most recently, Lawrence VanDyke was accused by the ABA of bias against LGBTQ people.
""He's done work for groups like Alliance for Defending Freedom and that flags him as oh you must be someone who will be unfair for example to LGBT litigants before him which he said they unfairly said that he wouldn't say he would be fair to all litigants and that's not true,"" Judicial Crisis Network Carrie Severino said. ""(VanDyke said), 'I believe everyone is made in the image and likeness of God and they need to be treated equally'.""
Severino was in the East Room during what she calls an ""exciting milestone for the president,"" pointing out that it's not just the Supreme Court that makes historic rulings.
""People don't realize more than 99% of cases end at the appellate courts, they don't get to the Supreme Court,"" said Severino.

Trump has also placed two of the nine seats on the US Supreme Court. A move Republican lawmakers say will define his time in office.
""The defining moment of your presidency for me was the Kavanaugh hearing,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). ""This room would be empty if we had failed Brett Kavanaugh.""
The Senate is close to confirming Trump's 44th Appeals Court Judge. 
President Trump said within two months he expects 182 federal judges to have been approved.

He'll return to the political stage a year to the day after resigning as Trump's first attorney general at the president's request.
The 72-year-old Sessions had been one of the president's earliest supporters back when he was a senator from Alabama, which led the president to give him a top post in his administration. But their relationship soured because Sessions recused himself from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
Sessions was a longtime Republican senator from Alabama, but his departure had left the seat open for a Democrat challenger who managed to win the seat.
Now that Sessions is returning to fight for the senator post, his entry upends the primary race. It has a crowded field of challengers hoping to take on Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. The primary will take place on March 3.
One source told The Hill that Sessions plans to forcefully support Trump's agenda and denounce Democrats' impeachment efforts.
Even though Trump had publicly attacked Sessions in the past, Sessions has stayed loyal to Trump. In a speech last month at a Republican fundraiser in Huntsville, Sessions confirmed his support for Trump.
“That’s why I supported him and why I still do support him,” Sessions told the crowd of about 500. “He is relentlessly and actually honoring the promises he made to the American people.”
If Sessions does indeed jump into the race, he will face off against former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville; Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill; former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore; and others.
“When President Trump took on Washington, only one Senator out of a hundred had the courage to stand with him: me. I was the first to support President Trump. I was his strongest advocate. I still am. We must make America great again,"" Sessions said in a statement posted to his website. "

President Trump is touting his achievements in confirming judicial nominees.
In a short ceremony held in the East Room of the White House Wednesday, Trump announced his administration and Republicans in Congress have reached the milestone of confirming more than 150 federal judges.
""We should have within a short period of time, like two months, we should have about 182 federal judges,"" the President said as the audience applauded its appreciation.  
President Trump is closing in on filling up a quarter of the benches on federal appellate courts in just under three years in office. 
Of the 179 positions on the circuit courts, 43 are currently occupied by President Trump's nominees. Four seats are currently open and an additional five are expected to become vacant due to retirements.

President Barack Obama nominated 55 circuit judges who were confirmed over eight years.
""And as I say often, percentage-wise, you'll never beat one man and we all know who that is -- George Washington, 100 percent,"" Trump joked. 
""But in terms of I'd like to say quality and quality, I think we are going to be just about number 1 by the time we finish.  Number one of any president or any administration, so I want to thank all of you for the incredible job you've,"" the President said referring to all of his Republican colleagues in the room. 
""And they (the judges) will uphold our Constitution as written,"" Trump said. ""These distinguished men and women are some of the most gifted scholars, respected jurists, and the finest legal minds ever placed on the federal bench. Together we're restoring American freedom, defending American justice, and preserving the extraordinary vision of our founding fathers."" 
While a number of Trump's nominees are filling seats previously held by judges that were appointed by Republican presidents, a number are taking the place of liberal judges appointed by Democrats.
Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network attended Wednesday's ceremony. 
""This is a historic milestone for President Trump and the country both in terms of the number of circuit court judges appointed and their exceptional qualifications and independence,"" she said in a statement. ""President Trump has kept his promise to the American people.""

It's a big deal in many ways, but partly because Virginia's Democrats pushed this year for an extreme pro-abortion bill that would allow abortion up to the moment of birth. The only thing that stopped them was the slim majority held by Republican lawmakers. More about their expected liberal agenda in a moment.
But first, national Democrats are celebrating the win after liberal billionaires pumped millions of dollars into the state in hopes of turning the vote into some sort of referendum on President Trump.

While Democrats claim Virginia's election results are bad news for President Trump, CBN News Chief Political Analyst David Brody points out Trump lost Virginia in 2016, but still won the presidency.
""Hillary Clinton won Virginia in 2016 and how did it work out for her,"" Brody said during an interview with the CBN News show Faith Nation.  ""Donald Trump is not on the ballot so as much as Democrats are making a big deal, but when he's on the ticket - it makes a big difference.""
Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway is also brushing off the blue wave talk, saying, ""It's been trending blue for quite a while now.""
Suburban voters turned out in high numbers, particularly in the Washington, DC area. 
Polling showed that gun control was a major issue after a shooter killed 12 people in Virginia Beach in May.
""We ran on a very definite message, and that was we believe in conservative values,"" said incumbent House Speaker Kirk Cox (R).  Cox defeated his Democrat challenger Sheila Bynum-Coleman.
Democrat special interest groups poured money into the state in the final days. One week before election day more than $82 million had been spent making this the most expensive election in Virginia history. 
After the election, House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R), who won his race, issued a warning.
""Make no mistake: radical liberals from out of our Commonwealth will soon demand a return on tens of millions they invested to elect a far-left Democratic majority,"" he said. ""Virginians should expect public policies that look a lot more like the train-wreck that is California than the Virginia of good fiscal management and common-sense conservative governance.""
The agenda of Virginia Democrats includes stricter gun control laws, raising the minimum wage and more liberal abortion laws.
It also includes ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the US Constitution. Virginia is the final state needed for possible passage of the gender equality measure. As CBN News reported this year, many view the ERA as a Trojan horse for enshrining taxpayer-funded abortion in the Constitution.
While Gilbert promises the GOP will fight the agenda, the Democrats have the upper hand for the first time in decades.
""The voters like the process that we as Democrats have made over the past few years and they want us to continue that progress over the next few years and beyond,"" said Virginia's Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam. But the results weren't necessarily due to any popularity from Northam who had roiled the state in a blackface controversy and had publicly endorsed what many consider to be infanticide earlier in the year.

Meanwhile, in Kentucky Democratic challenger Andy Beshear declared victory in the governor's race over Republican incumbent Matt Bevin. The GOP governor is reportedly trailing by roughly 5,000 votes and is not conceding the race. President Trump campaigned for Bevin a day before the election, in a state that he won big in 2016. But Bevin came into the race with plenty of baggage after clashing with Kentucky teachers in a controversial way, and other Republicans in the state fared better than he did in this election. It's not clear if Bevin and Beshear will face a recount.
""There have been more than a few irregularities,"" Bevin says. Left with few options, Bevin could now carry Kentucky into a drawn-out legal battle contesting the results. 
The Trump administration is positioning Beshear's slim margin as a win – not a warning sign. ""The president made that governor's race competitive,"" Conway says.
Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff told CBN News the Democrats' strategy is set to backfire. ""Democrats will focus on the governor's race and if they use that to pursue additional endless investigations and justification that what they're doing in Washington, DC is working, I think that's going to hurt them a lot in 2020,"" he says."

But it's the outcome in the Commonwealth of Virginia that may prove a bellwether for the big general election in 2020.
Voters in Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, New Jersey and Virginia are making their choices for state and local offices. Virginia has been a reliable Republican state for fifty years, but is now leaning blue.
Donald Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton by five percent in 2016. The state assembly is almost evenly split. Republicans only hold a one seat majority in both the House and the Senate.

BELOW: Big Stakes in Election Day on Tuesday, What Will It Tell Us About 2020?
One week before Election Day more than $82 million had been spent making this the most expensive election in Virginia history.
And perhaps more than a bellwether, this vote could test Democrat voter enthusiasm following a black-face scandal for Gov. Ralph Northam, and sexual assault allegations against Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax.
""I think it's a sign of enthusiasm and how much voters are fired up and ready to get out there and I think Democrats are trying to go down ballot. We saw efforts in Wisconsin in the mid-terms and they're really hoping to make some gains in the state legislatures,"" said Caitlin Conant, political director for CBS News.
Gun control and healthcare are the top issues for Virginia Democrats.
""Republicans just don't do healthcare. This has never been one of their strong suits and it's a real and decades-long problem. It's one of the reasons we got the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is because Republicans have paid insufficient attention to this issue,"" explained the Cato Institute's Michael Cannon. 
A large turnout of pro-life voters may make a difference to keep red or purple states from turning blue. 
Many Virginians were outraged when Democrat Gov. Northam appeared on the radio advocating infanticide. 
Vice President Mike Pence raised the abortion issue at get-out-the-vote rallies in Virginia and Kentucky.  
""At a time when leading Democrats advocate late-term abortion and defend infanticide, I promise you this president, this vice president and your governor will always stand for the right to life,"" Pence insisted in Kentucky where Gov. Matt Bevin describes himself as America's ""most pro-life governor"".
The vice president and president will be watching the Virginia race closely. It's a key southern state. What happens there could make a big difference not only for Virginians, but for Donald Trump's re-election chances in 2020. "

'Our Country Should Be More Fearful of White Men': Ilhan Omar’s Past Comments Fuel 'Political Food Fight' with Trump
Warren has come under fire from fellow Democrats along with Republicans and many economists over her high-priced government health care plan. 
Meanwhile, it has been said, ""politics makes strange bedfellows."" That all-too-common saying during election season was at play again Sunday night as socialist candidate Sanders received Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-Minn) endorsement.
Omar appeared with Sanders at a rally at the University of Minnesota and spoke on his behalf. 
She claimed there must be a ""movement of working-class"" that must be built for Sanders to win the White House next year.
""Here's the cold truth: We can't achieve any of these goals if we don't build a movement that is representative of all of our aspirations, all of our pain, and all of our shared trauma,"" Omar said. ""That is why we must build a mass movement of the working class that transcends faith, age, gender, and background.""
Omar also said President Sanders will ""fight against western imperialism and fight for a just world.""  
""I am proud to stand with the son of a Jewish refugee who survived genocide,"" Omar said, referring to Sanders. ""The acknowledgment of pain and suffering is personal for both of us. The fight for human rights is undeniable. And when we recognize injustices of the past and present, whether it is genocide against Jewish people, Armenians or Rwandans or Bosnians or Native Americans or more,"" she continued.
Sanders didn't appear bothered by Omar's past anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements, unlike many of his colleagues in Congress. She supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel and has repeatedly criticized the government of America's top democratic-ally in the Middle East. 
Sanders has also criticized the Jewish state during his campaign. Just last week, he said he would cut US aid to Israel and give the money to Palestinians in Gaza. 
When it was his turn at the microphone, Sanders thanked Omar by name.
""Thank you, Ilhan Omar,"" he said.
""People say that Ilhan and I make an odd political couple. But in fact, there is really nothing odd about it at all,"" he continued. ""Ilhan and I share a common link as the descendants of families who fled violence and poverty, and who came to this country as immigrants. But that is not just my story or Ilhan's story -- that is the story of America.""
Sanders also said he and Omar both were working to eliminate ""all student debt in America,"" and make all public colleges ""tuition-free.""
Omar's fellow Democrat progressives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Talib have also endorsed Sanders.
The poll also found concerns among Democrat voters about Sanders' health.  More than 4 in 10 Democrats believe he's not in good enough health to serve as president, according to The Post. "

Republicans are crying foul.
The president tweeted: ""Read the transcript"" and ""The greatest witch hunt in American history.""
""I was in an impeachment deposition but then had to leave that to come to the floor for a vote on the rules for impeachment,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) pointing out the way he and other Republicans feel the process has been mismanaged.
The House vote comes days after the president met with a group of evangelical Christian leaders at the White House.
""We basically told him, Mister President, you fight well alone, but you're not gonna have to fight well alone because we're going to be standing right there with you every step of the way because we don't actually believe this is about President Trump at all.

A senior White House Official confirmed to us that Health and Human Services would be introducing new federal rules detailing that faith-based groups only need to adhere to nondiscrimination provisions passed by Congress, not any previous agency regulations. Back in 2016, the Obama Administration added sexual orientation language to an HHS rule, forcing faith-based groups to choose between their biblical beliefs on marriage or receiving federal money to serve their communities. 
""This Administration is committed to doing rule-making right, and to removing regulatory barriers that prevent non-profits from doing what they do best—serving the needy and vulnerable in their communities,"" according to this Senior White House Official. ""The Administration is also fully committed to preserving the religious freedom rights of faith-based organizations, and we are proud to announce this proposed rule today doing just that.""
 
Since the new rule would apply to only laws passed by Congress, that means faith-based groups would have to comply with the three main federal laws on equality: the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. All of them protect citizens against religious discrimination but none of them mention sexual orientation. 
In the days before President Obama left office, HHS added the controversial regulation with language covering sexual orientation. The Trump Administration rule would make that regulation null and void. Currently, if faith-based groups want to apply for federal funds, they must request a waiver from the Obama rule. The proposal, that will be announced Friday, is the first step in the regulatory process. There will be a time for public comment before it goes into effect. It is expected to be challenged in court.
 
This move should not come as a shock to those who have followed President Trump's directives closely. The White House has moved to protect medical workers who, due to their religious beliefs, want to opt-out of procedures such as abortion and assisted suicide. They also took action to make sure religious businesses can choose to not enroll in health insurance plans that cover contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs.  
As for protecting the rights of faith-based adoption and foster care providers, Trump has been very clear. At the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this year in Washington, Trump gave a hint of things to come. ""My administration is working to ensure that faith-based adoption agencies are able to help vulnerable children find their forever families while following their deeply held beliefs,"" the president remarked. It's a controversial issue as lawmakers, think tanks, and advocacy groups grapple over whether faith-based groups should be funded by the federal government if they choose not to place children in the homes of same-sex couples. 
 
What isn't controversial is that there is a foster care crisis in America – 443,000 children are in foster care and about 100,000 are waiting to be adopted. For the last five years, the foster care crisis has continued to get worse. The Trump administration believes the new rule will make it easier for faith-based agencies to stay in business and with this crisis boiling over, that's vital to the well being of hundreds of thousands of children. In the past, the administration has pointed to certain cities that saw foster care problems increase substantially after prohibiting faith-based agencies from taking part in their efforts.

In a tweet, President Trump declared the impeachment probe, ""The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!""
Two Democrats joined every Republican in voting ""No"" on the official rules for the House impeachment inquiry, which will entail public hearings.  
Even the Speaker of the House took part in the vote, bringing the tally to 232-196 to pass the resolution formalizing ground rules for impeachment.
""The Republicans are afraid of the truth,"" said Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
Ahead of the vote, the split-screen between the parties was on full display. Next to a graphic cutout of an American flag, Pelosi said democracy is at stake, adding that ""this is something that is very solemn, but also prayerful.""
With a hammer and sickle prop of their own, Republicans are accused Democrats of unprecedented veto power over witnesses. 
""This is Soviet-style rules,"" said Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip. 
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) echoed that sentiment. ""You're trying to put a ribbon on a sham process,"" he said.
The process guides rules for the President's lawyers to cross-examine witnesses and defend President Trump in hearings and outlines Republican and Democrat participation in the inquiry on three committees. 
""We recognize the seriousness of this undertaking,"" said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, adding that the proceedings will allow for public hearings in the Intelligence and Judiciary committees.
The California Democrat said impeachment is a remedy to a president who sacrifices the national interest. 
""I make no prejudgment as to whether that remedy will be warranted when we finish these hearings, I will wait until all the facts are put forward,"" said Schiff.
Committee chairs are now preparing to release transcripts of witness depositions. 
 
To call out Democrats for piling on, Jordan said, ""I was in an impeachment deposition but then had to leave that to come to the floor for a vote on the rules for impeachment.""
The resolution comes as witness interviews continue behind closed doors with Tim Morrison, the top Russia expert on the National Security Council, testifying Thursday ahead of a reported resignation. 
Morrison's testimony comes after Bill Taylor, the top diplomat to Ukraine, said Morrison had a ""sinking feeling"" over President Trump's conversation with Ukraine's president.
That feeling sets the stage for a televised impeachment battle now set to begin."

It includes plans for public hearings after House Republicans demanded transparency for weeks.
The resolution to launch an official inquiry passed along party lines. Only two Democrats voted against it and no Republicans supported it.
 
Both House and Senate Republicans argue the rules outlined in the resolution from House Democrats rob President Trump of the basic right of due process – even as they prepare to hold public hearings and release prior witness testimonies.
 
""Legitimizing an unfair process by voting doesn't make it fair,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told CBN News.
 
The resolution gives top lawmakers on both sides more time to question witnesses. While it also allows Republicans to request witnesses, the fine print gives Democrats the power to veto those requests.
 
""Republicans can't subpoena witnesses unless Schiff agrees – so it is a joke of due process,"" continued Graham.
 
Sen. Graham has introduced his own resolution in the Senate labeling the whole process a sham.
 
""They're creating a process that will be damaging to the presidency. Forget about Trump for a moment, if the House in the future can have closed-door hearings where the President's lawyers can't participate, you selectively leak information out to the public to drive the numbers of the president down, you can literally destroy the presidency,"" warned Graham. ""The reason they're not doing it like they did before is because they don't have a case. This is all politically driven.""
 
Democrats maintain they're following tradition.
 
""They are going forward with one which is something the President and others have insisted on. Secondly, the process is going to be open,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL).
 
They're calling on their Republican counterparts to focus concerns on Colonel Vindman's testimony that the transcript of the infamous Ukraine phone call was incomplete.
 
""It certainly concerns me if the White House has released an incomplete transcript,"" commented Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT).
 
Graham tells CBN News the changes Vindman suggests don't make a difference to him.
 
""I've made my mind up, there's nothing wrong with this phone call and the changes he suggests make no difference to me,"" concluded Graham.
 
Congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH), who has heard each witness testify, stands by the ""no quid pro quo"" defense and says he's not concerned with Vindman's testimony.
 
""The fundamental facts have never changed – read the call, we know what President Trump and President Zelenksy have said and the facts I just went through so no it doesn't trouble me,"" said Jordan.
 
He adds that his biggest concern is only one member of Congress knows the whistleblower's identity – House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.
 
""That's what troubles me more than anything else, particularly now that we're less than 13 months before an election,"" added Jordan.

The Rev. Robert Morey said in a statement, ""Sadly, this past Sunday, I had to refuse holy communion to former Vice President Joe Biden. Any public figure who advocates for abortion places himself or herself outside of church teaching."" 
Biden told MSNBC on Tuesday that he wouldn't discuss the reports.

This is not the first incident where Communion has been withheld from a politician who advocates abortion. 
In 2007, Providence, Rhode Island Bishop Thomas Tobin told former congressman Patrick J. Kennedy to stop taking Communion over his support for abortion rights.
Bishop Tobin said, ""He said he was a practicing Catholic, that he embraced the faith and the fact that he didn't accept all the teachings of the church didn't make him, in his words, less of a Catholic. In fact, in a way, it does.""
Tobin had said though that the move was meant to be confidential before Kennedy made it public.  
Ten years ago, Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput said politicians who won't oppose abortion should neither call themselves Catholic nor take Communion. He said the Catholic church's pro-life beliefs are more important than ""the vanity or hurt feelings of an individual Catholic governor or senator or even vice president.""
In 2004, then Roman Catholic Archbishop Raymond Burke refused Communion to former senator and presidential candidate John Kerry for his pro-choice stances. 
Lifesite News reported the response from the Kerry Campaign team was unapologetic. Kim Molstre, a Kerry campaign spokeswoman, said, ""The archbishop has the right to deny Communion to whoever he wants, but Senator Kerry respectfully disagrees with him on the issue of choice.""
""I would have to admonish him not to present himself for Communion,"" said Burke. ""I might give him a blessing or something.""
Burke didn't just single out Democrats. He also denied Communion to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2007, a Republican, for supporting abortion rights, according to Catholic News Agency.
""I'm not running for religious office,"" Giuliani said. ""I'm not going to debate the opinion of an archbishop of the Catholic Church or an official of the Protestant Church or a rabbi. That's an interpretation of religion. They're entitled to their interpretation of religion.""
Also in 2008, Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann advised former Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to refrain from receiving for her pro-abortion position.
Naumann directed Sebelius to take ""the necessary steps for amendment of her life which would include a public repudiation of her previous efforts and actions in support of laws and policies sanctioning abortion.""
Instead, Sebelius decided to work against religious rights as secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services in the Obama administration, attempting to force a group of nuns to provide healthcare coverage for abortion-causing drugs.  
The belief of the Catholic Church has historically been that ""abortion willed, either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law.""   "

White House Says Second Whistleblower Doesn't Matter: Here's Why
Pelosi's resolution establishing guidelines and procedures for a House impeachment investigation puts one of President Trump's biggest critics in the driver's seat.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff will have the power to call public hearings and oversee the witness list.
The resolution says Republicans can ""suggest"" subpoenas and witnesses, but Democrats have the final say.
In a statement issued Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham criticized the House resolution, arguing that it ""confirmed that House Democrats' impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start.""
""The White House is barred from participating at all,"" Grisham added. ""This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the administration.""
Speaking on Fox News Hannity program, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) had harsh words for the resolution.
""In the history of the country, we've never had the Intelligence Committee participate in an impeachment inquiry. Under the resolution they're going to pass tomorrow, the president's counsel cannot participate in the intel committee inquiry so the president is denied right to counsel and the Republicans can't call witnesses without Schiff agreeing - so this whole thing is a sham.""
One House Democrat says he's not likely to vote for the resolution.
New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew said he's skeptical there's enough evidence to impeach the president and not enough votes in the Senate to convict him.
He told The Washington Post, ""I would imagine that I'm going to vote no unless I see something really unusual. It's not that I'm friends with the president. It's not that I believe he should be protected. I don't mind if he's investigated - but what's going to happen in my mind, it's going to happen here in the House; it will go over to the Senate and then he will believe that he has been exonerated. He will still be the president, and he will still be the candidate - a candidate who has been exonerated by the Senate.""
""Everybody says, 'Be on the right side of history' - I think the right side of history is not to impeach,"" Van Drew added.
He says he's simply not sure the evidence proves Trump did anything that's deserving of impeachment. 
""It's not to protect me politically, because there's no win on this. You're gonna get hurt either way - I just think it's the right thing to do,"" he added. ""I've seen things that are distasteful and things that make you uncomfortable, and I don't like the way they're termed. I don't see it as impeachable."" 
Also, Van Drew emphasized that proof of a crime being committed ""would have been in the transcript"" and that the impeachment process is preventing Congress from tackling more important issues. 
Meanwhile, the first current White House staffer faced impeachment investigators on Tuesday.
In a closed-door deposition, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an Iraq war veteran and a top official with the National Security Council, was asked about being in the situation room listening in on the July 25 call to Ukraine.
In his opening statement, Vindman expressed concern over the call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky. 
Vindman wrote, ""I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen.""
He even feared the call would ""undermine US national security"", reporting those concerns to his superior. 
""I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,"" Vindman added.
President Trump pushed back on Vindman's comments calling him a ""Never Trumper witness"" tweeting ""Was he on the same call that I was? Can't be possible! Please ask him to read the transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!""
Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call “concerned” today’s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can’t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019
Vindman did make clear he's not the whistleblower.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) said legislators should consider the sources of the impeachment inquiry and how the partisan process got started.
""The one thing that is clear is this is all based on one anonymous whistleblower, and there are 435 members of Congress, and only one member, only one member knows who that whistleblower is and that individual is Adam Schiff,"" Jordan said.
""How is that fair that only Adam Schiff knows how this whole thing started?"" he added. ""This is something that we need to get to the bottom of and know how this whole thing started.""
House Democrats are considering a timeline that would include public impeachment hearings before Thanksgiving and votes on whether to impeach Trump by Christmas."

""There's nothing wrong with asking that the US government acknowledge human rights abuses here before we acknowledge them overseas,"" Jilani said on Twitter.

The historic non-binding resolution is a resounding rebuke to Turkey, which denies the genocide ever happened. 
On Wednesday, Ankara summoned ambassador to Turkey David Satterfield over the vote. 
Turkey quickly rejected the measure as a ""meaningless political step"" and said it risks hurting Ankara's relationship with Washington ""at an extremely fragile time"" for international and regional security.
Congress came close to passing similar resolutions in the past but backed out after facing pressure from Turkey. Tuesday's vote is the first time the US Congress has passed a measure directly blaming Turkey for the genocide against Armenians. 
Armenian National Committee of America Executive Director Aram Hamparian told the Wall Street Journal that the resolution puts America on the right side of history. 
""This vote places America on the side of justice, which has, for far too long, been denied to the victims and surviving generations of the Armenian genocide,"" Hamparian said.
The House also passed a bipartisan bill Tuesday to sanction senior Turkish officials and Turkish forces for the country's invasion into northeastern Syria. That bill passed 403-16.
  
Both bills are a symbol of America's deteriorating relations with Turkey.

As far as our research shows, Hillary herself has not said that she thinks God wants her to be president. She demurred from that idea in a forum at Messiah College in 2008 when she was running for the Democratic nomination the first time, saying with a smile, ""I guess we'll see.""
But whether God wants her to or not, some Democrats are quietly, and not-so-quietly, floating the idea of Hillary carrying their party's mantle once again.
Hillary sure hasn't avoided the spotlight. She stirred the 2020 pot recently when she claimed the Russians had planted Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) to undermine the election as a possible third party candidate.
She also fueled speculation about a Hillary run when she put forth the idea to PBS reporter Judy Woodruff, that perhaps there should be a ""rematch"" between her and Trump, saying, ""Obviously, I can beat him again.""  
Delusional, or just making a joke, it's no joke that anxiety is rising among Democrats about their current field of candidates.
""With Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on maybe pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,"" David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama told The New York Times.
He's referring to Joe Biden. Though still the front runner, there's concern about him. He's struggling with fundraising, he's not shone brightly in debates, and he's being bombarded by family ethical issues that just won't go away. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren is surging in polls, but there's fear someone who wants to eliminate private health insurance is just too far to the left to win a general election against a formidable President Trump.  
A ""who else is there?"" desperation is taking hold. Michael Bloomberg is said to be a favorite among Wall Street Democrats, and he supposedly is toying with the idea, but he reportedly won't take the plunge unless he's sure he can win.
Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown's recent opinion piece in The San Francisco Chronicle is making the rounds among some party insiders, touting Hillary as the great hope of the Democrats – and obviously NOT touting his former lover, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.
""It's time for Hillary Clinton to come out of retirement, lace up the gloves and get back in the ring with President Trump for what would be the biggest political rematch ever,"" he writes.
""Call me crazy, but from what I've seen so far, Clinton is the only candidate short of Barack Obama who has the brains, the battle-tested brawn, and the national presence to take out Trump. And Obama can't run.""
The Washington Post reports people close to Hillary say she's unlikely to do it all again. But... maybe...
""Ultimately, it's unlikely she would do it,"" said one person who has spoken with her. ""But put it this way: It ain't zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely.""
No one's expecting a Biden pull-out from the race, if it happens at all, before the first of the year. But Democrat dissatisfaction with the current line-up and qualms about any of them being able to beat Donald Trump make the speculation hot and heavy about somebody different.
""If Biden were surging, I doubt you would be hearing this,"" Harold Ickes, a longtime Democratic consultant, and Clinton confidant told the New York Times. ""This shows a restlessness among a lot of people."""

In a statement, Graham said there's no doubt in his mind that his resolution forced the Democrats to respond.
On CBN's Faith Nation program, ABC News Political Director Rick Klein said, ""I think it's them acknowledging at least tacitly that so far doing private, closed-door hearings has not worked out on a political level. There's been a lot of pressure from Republicans to say 'put it all out there,' so now we'll begin to see what that process is.""    
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) commented on the closed-door testimony regarding the impeachment inquiry of Trump. 
""This is all a ridiculous unfair partisan process and the American people see through it, so I think the speaker is going to try to dress it up a little bit, put a little lipstick on the pig, as they say, have this vote on Thursday. But it's not going to change anything and I think you're going to see every Republican vote against it,"" Jordan said.
Dr. James Dobson, president and founder of the James Dobson Family Institute, reacted to the impeachment inquiry, insisting that politicians are abusing the process in their quest for more power.
""Over the last several weeks, we have witnessed the dark side of our political process in action. It is abundantly clear that certain politicians are more concerned with using the impeachment inquiry to score political points rather than to honor our constitutional system and seek the good of this nation,"" Dobson said.

House committees are trying to determine if President Donald Trump violated his oath of office by asking a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.
The House will take a vote this week to formalize Democrats' impeachment inquiry amid President Donald Trump's criticism that the probe is ""illegitimate."" 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the step is being taken ""to eliminate any doubt"" about the process. 
In a letter to her colleagues on Monday, Pelosi said the resolution will ""affirm the ongoing, existing investigation"" and layout procedures for open hearings and the next steps going forward. It involves holding public hearings, releasing transcripts from closed-door interviews and transferring evidence to the Judiciary Committee, which will be tasked with drawing up potential articles of impeachment.
She dismissed the White House's argument that impeachment isn't happening without a formal vote, saying that ""of course, this argument has no merit.""
The Constitution doesn't require a vote to begin impeachment. But Trump and his Republican colleagues have cited the lack of one to say that the probe is not real. Trump used that argument in a lengthy letter to the House earlier this month saying that he wouldn't cooperate.
Many government officials have cooperated with the inquiry despite Trump's orders. But Pelosi's letter comes as a national security official defied a House subpoena Monday, escalating the standoff between Congress and the White House over who will testify."

Recent Pew research shows both Republicans and Democrats view each other negatively and more so since the 2016 election.
So does that mean we should avoid the issue of politics altogether in social settings and at upcoming holiday gatherings? 
The women behind the popular podcast, Pantsuit Politics, say absolutely not. In their book, I Think You're Wrong (But I'm Listening), they give advice on how to approach some of those difficult conversations.
 
Sarah Stewart Holland, a Democrat, and Beth Silvers, a Republican, make the purpose of their book clear in its tagline: ""a guide to grace-filled political conversations.""
 
""We talked a lot about whether we wanted to use the word 'grace' because it's a word that we use among ourselves all the time at Pantsuit Politics and a lot of people say, 'Why don't you just talk about civility?' And we realized, we're talking about something deeper than civility,"" explained Silvers in an interview with CBN's Faith Nation.
 
""This is not, let's just be nice and kind in these conversations. Sometimes grace requires a really firm stance. What we wanted to convey with 'grace-filled political conversations' are conversations that connect you to your values.""     
 
Stewart Holland stresses the importance of representing your values in your policy positions as well as how you engage in them. Equally important she says is how you treat the other person and speak about them.
 
""Those reflect your values as well,"" she said.   
 
When it comes to those especially sticky issues like gun control and abortion, the women's advice is to approach the conversation like a reporter.
 
""Sometimes it's best to approach the conversation like a reporter, like somebody who's just curious to learn,"" explained Stewart Holland. ""To think, where did you get that information? Is there anything I could say that would help you see this issue differently? Or sometimes what I like to do is go really, really far out. How does this play historically? Is this different than how somebody 100 years ago would have talked about it? Just giving some bigger, wider perspective to the issues and not just see it as a debate where we have to convince one another.""
 
Both women say you don't have to leave the conversation agreeing on everything. Rather, it's important to seek an understanding of why the other person sees things the way they do.
 
""The goal is not to emerge from the Thanksgiving table with draft legislation,"" said Silvers. ""We come together and connect over politics because they do offer us spaces to explore how we live in community with each other and that's relevant to our families. So we want people to have these conversations but we just want them to understand, the goal isn't to convince anyone. You don't need to walk away all agreeing on who you're going to vote for. It should be a curious exploration.""
 
So why is it not a good idea to, as the saying goes, ""agree to disagree and move on?""  
 
""I hate that statement,"" Stewart said with a slightly exasperated laugh. ""The reason I think we both have such strong reactions is because it sounds like, 'We're done here. We're not going to talk about this.' And that's the opposite of what we want."" 
""What we want people to do is say, 'Okay, I think maybe it's become too heated right now but I care about what you think and I want to continue this conversation later. I want to continue to talk about the issues in our country that matter, the values that are important to us and maybe even become better versed in why we disagree or maybe even find some agreement.'""
 
So, while America may be more divided today than it was a few years ago, it doesn't mean your holiday gatherings have to reflect that. One word to remember in all of your conversations, political or not, is ""grace."" 
 
""Even if I disagree, you're still a person I value and respect in my life. Even if I think this policy position is wrong, I want to hear it out and see what I can learn from it. Grace has that element of 'we belong',"" said Silvers."

But, heightened tensions are expected to rise again as Washington's attention shifts from the raid back to Trump's impeachment inquiry.
The president and many Republicans charge that the House impeachment process is improper. They believe the full House of Representatives should vote to approve the inquiry and the hearings should be held in public, not behind closed doors.
An attorney for Charles Kupperman, former White House national security official, said Kupperman was scheduled to testify on Monday, CNN reports.
If he refuses to take the stand, he could face ""contempt of Congress"" charges for the Ukraine scandal.
Additional witnesses summoned this week are current National Security Council staff members Tim Morrison and Alexander Vindman. 
William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, told lawmakers in his deposition last week that Morrison is essential in the inquiry due to phone calls he had with Morrison that described the Ukraine effort.
Also, committees are scheduled to hear from three other State Department and Defense Department witnesses. Legislators want to determine whether military aid to Ukraine was delayed as a condition of the investigations.
Friday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) introduced a resolution condemning the inquiry, which all but three Senate Republicans are co-sponsoring.
""The purpose of the resolution is to let the House know that the process you're engaging in regarding the impeachment of President Trump is out of bounds, is inconsistent with due process as we know it. It's a Star Chamber-type inquiry and it's a substantial deviation from what the House has done in the past regarding impeachment of other presidents,"" Graham said.
It takes 67 votes in the Senate to remove a president from office.
Democrats hold 45 Senate seats, plus two independents who caucus with them. That means they would need 20 Republicans to join them in voting to convict.
With at least 50 Senate Republicans supporting Sen. Graham's condemnation of the House impeachment inquiry, the numbers just don't add up for the Democrats to remove Trump from office. 
Amidst mounting pressure, Democrats are reportedly considering making the hearings public as soon as mid-November. "

John Conyers, one of the longest-serving members of Congress whose resolutely liberal stance on civil rights made him a political institution in Washington and back home in Detroit despite several scandals, has died. He was 90.
Conyers, among the high-profile politicians toppled by sex harassment allegations in 2017, died at his home on Sunday, said Detroit police spokesman Cpl. Dan Donakowski. The death “looks like natural causes,” Donakowski added.
Known as the dean of the Congressional Black Caucus, which he helped found, Conyers became one of only six black House members when he won his first election by just 108 votes in 1964. The race was the beginning of more than 50 years of election dominance: Conyers regularly won elections with more than 80% of the vote, even after his wife went to prison for taking a bribe.

That voter loyalty helped Conyers freely speak his mind. He took aim at both Republicans and fellow Democrats: He said then-President George W. Bush “has been an absolute disaster for the African-American community” in 2004, and in 1979 called then-President Jimmy Carter “a hopeless, demented, honest, well-intentioned nerd who will never get past his first administration.”
Throughout his career, Conyers used his influence to push civil rights. After a 15-year fight, he won passage of legislation declaring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.‘s birthday a national holiday, first celebrated in 1986. He regularly introduced a bill starting in 1989 to study the harm caused by slavery and the possibility of reparations for slaves’ descendants. That bill never got past a House subcommittee.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Sunday that without Conyers there would be no King holiday — “no doubt about that.”
“He was one of the most consequential congressmen,” Jackson said.
His district office in Detroit employed civil rights legend Rosa Parks from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. In 2005, Conyers was among 11 people inducted to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame.
But after a nearly 53-year career, he became the first Capitol Hill politician to lose his job in the torrent of sexual misconduct allegations sweeping through the nation’s workplaces. A former staffer alleged she was fired because she rejected his sexual advances, and others said they’d witnessed Conyers inappropriately touching female staffers or requesting sexual favors.
He denied the allegations but eventually stepped down, citing health reasons.
“My legacy can’t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we’re going through now,” Conyers told a Detroit radio station from a hospital where he’d been taken after complaining of lightheadedness in December 2017. “This, too, shall pass. My legacy will continue through my children.”
Conyers was born and grew up in Detroit, where his father, John Conyers Sr., was a union organizer in the automotive industry and an international representative with the United Auto Workers union. He insisted that his son, a jazz aficionado from an early age, not become a musician.
The younger Conyers heeded the advice, but jazz remained, he said, one of his “great pleasures.” He sponsored legislation to forgive the $1.6 million tax debt of band leader Woody Herman’s estate and once kept a standup bass in his Washington office.
Before heading to Washington, Conyers served in the National Guard and with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Korean War supervising repairs of military aircraft. He earned his bachelor’s and law degrees from Wayne State University in the late 1950s.
His political aspirations were honed while working as a legislative assistant from 1958 to 1961 to U.S. Rep. John Dingell, a fellow Michigan Democrat who, when he retired in 2014 at age 88, was Congress’ longest-serving member. That mantle then was passed onto Conyers.
Dingell died in February.
Soon after being elected to Congress, Conyers’ leadership at home — in the segregated streets of Detroit — would be tested. Parts of the city were burned during riots in July 1967 that were sparked by hostilities between black residents and Detroit’s mostly white police force, and by the cramped living conditions in black neighborhoods.
Conyers climbed onto a flatbed truck and appealed to black residents to return to their homes, but he was shouted down. His district office was gutted by fire the next day. But the plight of the nation’s inner cities would remain his cause.
“In Detroit you’ve got high unemployment, a poverty rate of at least 30%, schools not in great shape, high illiteracy, poor families not safe from crime, without health insurance, problems with housing,” he told The Associated Press in 2004. “You can’t fix one problem by itself — they’re all connected.”
He was fiercely opposed to Detroit’s finances being taken over by a state-appointed emergency manager as the city declared bankruptcy in 2013. Conyers, whose district included much of Detroit, sought a federal investigation and congressional hearings, arguing it was “difficult to identify a single instance” where such an arrangement, where local officials are stripped of most of their power, succeeds.
Conyers was the only House Judiciary Committee member to have sat in on two impeachment hearings: He supported a 1972 resolution recommending President Richard Nixon’s impeachment for his conduct of the Vietnam War, but when the House clashed in 1998 over articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton, Conyers said: “Impeachment was designed to rid this nation of traitors and tyrants, not attempts to cover up an extramarital affair.”
Conyers also had scandals of his own.
In 2009, his wife Monica Conyers, a Detroit city councilwoman largely elected on the strength of her husband’s last name, pleaded guilty to bribery. The case was related to a sludge hauling contract voted on by the City Council, and she spent nearly two years in prison.
Three years earlier, the House ethics committee closed a three-year investigation of allegations that Conyers’ staff worked on political campaigns and was ordered to baby-sit for his two children and run his personal errands. He admitted to a “lack of clarity” with staffers and promised changes.
But he couldn’t survive the last scandal. An ethics committee launched a review after a former longtime staffer said Conyers’ office paid her more than $27,000 under a confidentiality agreement to settle a complaint in 2015. She alleged she was fired because she rejected his sexual advances, and other said they’d witnesses inappropriate behavior.
Conyers initially said he looked forward to vindicating himself and his family, but he announced his immediate retirement in December 2017 after fellow Democrats called for his resignation. The chorus included Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the House’s top Democrat.
Conyers became chairman of the House Judiciary Committee when Democrats regained the House majority in 2006. He oversaw 2007 hearings into the White House’s role in the firings of eight federal prosecutors and 2009 hearings on how the NFL dealt with head injuries to players.
Conyers frequently swam against the prevailing political currents during his time in Congress. He backed, for example, anti-terrorism legislation that was far less sweeping than a plan pushed by then-Attorney General John Ashcroft in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
He was also an early supporter in 2007 of then-Sen. Barack Obama, who was expected by some in the Congressional Black Caucus to push public health insurance, sharp funding increases for urban development and other initiatives long blocked by Republicans.
“We want him to stand strong,” Conyers said in 2009.
Conyers enjoyed his greatest support back home in Detroit — except when he tried to venture into local politics. Conyers took on 16-year incumbent Mayor Coleman A. Young in 1989, launching his bid with the statement: “Look out, Big Daddy, I’m home.” But a poorly organized campaign helped him finish a mere third in the primary. He ran again for mayor when Young retired in 1993, and lost again.
Along with his wife, Conyers is survived by two sons, John III and Carl.

Hours later, they called for the whistleblower to come forward and give public testimony. 
Republicans say House Democrats are being selectively secretive in the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. 
""We demand open hearings. The American people deserve nothing less,"" said Rep. Mo Brooks, (R-AL) ""By golly, if they're going to do it, do it in public.""

This interruption led House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff to postpone Laura Cooper's deposition, which was already underway when Democrats say Republicans ""crashed the party"".
""We're going to go in there and demand we get our rights as members of Congress,"" said Rep. Andy Biggs, (R-AZ).
GOP lawmakers lambasted House Democrats for making up the rules as they go.

Republicans also still demand Democrats hold an official House impeachment vote to authorize the inquiry.

Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), who sits on one of the investigating committees, says nothing going on behind closed doors is classified. 
""This is the Democrats strategy,"" he said. ""They like to cherry-pick leaks.""
Hours after the storm in, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) kept up the pressure by calling for the whistleblower who filed the complaint about the phone call to come out of hiding and publicly testify. 
Democrats argue their secretive investigation is the way things are normally done. 
""Investigations are not public,"" said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA). ""When the investigation is done, there'll be public hearings. That's how it's always been done.""
After Tuesday's hearing with acting US Ukraine Ambassador Bill Taylor, Democrats say his testimony proves there was an implicit quid pro quo between President Trump and Ukrainian officials. 
""This is my most disturbing day in Congress so far,"" said Rep. Andy Levin, (D-MI)
House Democrats also argue that more than 100 House members across three committees qualify to be in the standing-room-only hearing room. And they believe Republicans are trying to be disruptive because they don't want to hear the truth. "

""We have done them a great service and now we're getting out. Let someone else fight over this long blood-stained sand,"" Trump said Wednesday.
The president pulled American troops out of northern Syria earlier this month, clearing the way for Turkey to invade the area and driving the Kurds to flee territories they had spent years securing.

Trump insisted that he was fulfilling a campaign promise to bring American troops home from foreign wars.
""By the moves that we've made, we're achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey and Syria - including a 20-mile wide safe zone.""
Trump explained that the region's safe-zone is where some of the deadliest fightings have occurred.
""We've secured the oil and therefore a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil and we're going to be protecting it and we'll be deciding what we're going to do with it in the future,"" Trump added.
Russian President Putin met with Turkish President Erdogan in Sochi on Tuesday. They reached an agreement that transforms the map of northeast Syria in the wake of the withdrawal of US troops.
   
Russian military police have begun patrolling part of the Syrian border and Kurdish fighters must pull back from the border by next Tuesday.
The Hill reports that legislators were concerned that the chaos caused by Turkey's invasion would lead to an ISIS resurgence, including the escape of ISIS prisoners while their Kurdish guards focused on fighting Turkish forces.
""Should Turkey fail to honor its obligations, including the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, which I truly believe they will do, we reserve the right to re-impose crippling sanctions, including substantially increased tariffs on steel and all other products coming out of Turkey,"" Trump concluded."

Democrats say that term is offensive, but critics are saying those claims are hypocritical, pointing out that Joe Biden, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, and other Democrats used similar ""lynching"" terms in the 90's when they were opposing the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. 
Some Republican lawmakers are defending the president's comment, saying the closed-door sessions deprive the president of the opportunity to defend himself.

Trump's Impeachment 'Lynching' Comment Goes Viral
'This Process Is Rotten to the Core': GOP Blasts Secretive Dem Impeachment Agenda
House Won't Vote to Formalize Impeachment Probe
'Witch Hunt': New Book Claims Trump Victim of 'Dirtiest Trick in American Political History'
In fact, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) plans to introduce a resolution condemning the closed-door impeachment inquiry, which he calls ""illegitimate.""         
""We cannot allow future presidents and this president to be impeached based on an inquiry in the House that's never been voted upon, that does not allow the president to confront the witnesses against him, call witnesses on his behalf and cross-examine people who are accusing him of misdeeds,"" Graham said on Fox News' Hannity.
One of those witnesses, acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, testified Tuesday that he was told that if the president of Ukraine did not announce he was launching investigations into Joe Biden and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, Trump would not release aid to Ukraine or agree to a White House meeting.
The testimony also said Trump repeatedly told officials he wasn't after a ""quid pro quo,"" but established a trade between the US aid and the investigations.
A White House statement calls Taylor's testimony a ""triple hearsay"" and said the career diplomat is a ""radical unelected bureaucrat"".
Vice President Mike Pence insisted there was no ""quid pro quo.""
""The American people can read the transcript of the phone call the president had with President Zelensky, and they will see there was no quid pro quo,"" Pence told Fox News' The Ingraham Angle.
But Democratic Rep. Andy Levin of Michigan found Taylor's testimony troubling. ""In my ten short months in Congress – it's not even noon, right? – and this is my most disturbing day in Congress so far,"" Levin said.
Meanwhile, the president is under fire for describing the impeachment inquiry as a ""lynching"".
""How dare he compare our constitutional obligation for oversight to a hate crime,"" said Democrat Rep. Karen Bass who is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.
But on CBN News' Faith Nation, a member of the Trump Leadership Council, Dr. Bill Bennett, said it was not a problem to use that word.
""The president is visceral in his reactions – I don't know if you've noticed that – but he tends to say the first thing that comes into his head,"" Bennett said. ""Yeah, I think it's okay, as I think you pointed out, 'high-tech lynching' is what Clarence Thomas said.""
""The Clinton protestors talked about lynching; lynching has become a term much more broadly in use,"" he continued. 
Still, Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden blasted Trump for using the term, and he was then exposed in viral videos showing him using the same word in the Clinton impeachment era.
Impeachment is not ""lynching,"" it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable. https://t.co/QcC25vhNeb

Voters in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia cast their votes November 5th. 
While President Obama was in the White House, Democrats lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats. Now Democrats are laser focused on getting them back and they're punching Republicans on health care.
In campaign attack ads, Democrats are accusing Republicans of not supporting protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Even though President Trump and Congressional Republicans have said repeatedly that they support protections, there's been no action, and Democrats smell blood.
 
""Republicans just don't do healthcare. This has never been one of their strong suits and it's a real and decades long problem. It's one of the reasons we got the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare is because Republicans have paid insufficient attention to this issue,"" Michael Cannon tells CBN News. He's director of health policy studies at Cato Institute.
Tuesday a group of House Republicans working closely with the White House released a proposal they say gives Americans freedom of choice, a clear alternative to socialist policies popular on the left.
  
""Parts of that proposal are really strong. They would take the $828 billion of workers' earnings that employers get to control because of a weird quirk of the tax code - they would give that $828 billion to the workers who earned it - that's a huge change and then the workers could buy their own health insurance. It stays with them as they move from job to job rather than having their employer choose a plan for them that disappears when they move to another job,"" Cannon explains.
Also in the plan, at the president's urging, protections for pre-existing conditions.
        
""We want to protect pre-existing conditions by treating those who are self-employed the same way we treat those with insurance who get it through their job,"" says Rep. Roger Marshall (R-KS) one of the architects of the plan.
How the healthcare debate turns out could have a lot to do with those state legislative races because after the 2020 census those lawmakers will draw congressional lines that will stand through 2030. That could change the number of Democrat- or Republican-leaning districts for a decade, directly affecting who's in control of Congress."

""So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!,""  Trump wrote.

""The fact it has been relentless. The fact is he has been relentlessly attacked by the mainstream media since before he took office that is what the President is talking about here,"" said Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley. 
2020 presidential campaign rivals aren't buying it and pushed back on social media with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) writing ""lynching is a reprehensible stain on this nation's history, as is this President.""
Julian Castro added, ""It is beyond shameful to use the word ""lynching"" to describe being held accountable for your actions.""
But Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) agreed with Trump's tweet calling the impeachment inquiry a ""sham.""
""This is a joke,"" Graham said. ""I'm going to let the whole world know that if we were doing this as a Democratic president, you would be all over me right now. This is a lynching in every sense. This is un-American.""
But even some key Republican lawmakers didn't agree with the choice of words. 
""That's not the language I would use. It's very clear what Democrats are doing here,"" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). 
The catalyst for the infamous tweet could have been due to the testimony of the President's acting ambassador to Ukraine.
It was Bill Taylor's turn in a revolving door of key witnesses.
He first sounded the Ukrainian aid alarm in a text message to the US ambassador to the EU. 
Taylor wrote. ""I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""
The recipient, Gordon Sondland replied, ""the President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quos of any kind."" 
Democrats say during closed-door testimony, Sondland said this message was dictated by the President himself. 
""Every single report starts with behind closed doors, he is not receiving due process – we all are aware of the situation in which Democrats are taking him behind closed doors releasing selective things not in context trying to attack and destroy this President,"" said Gidley.
The White House has asked for a full impeachment vote from the House
Republican lawmakers have echoed that request which would then give them the chance to be involved in the inquiry. 
“President Trump has done nothing wrong — this is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution. There was no quid pro quo,"" White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement released Tuesday.  ""Today was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats’ politically-motivated, closed-door, secretive hearings. Every day this nonsense continues more taxpayer time and money is wasted. President Trump is leading the way for the American people by delivering a safer, stronger, and more secure country - the do-nothing Democrats should consider doing the same.” "

Also, Scalise tweeted that Democrats are shielding House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) for shamefully conducting impeachment hearings in private. House Democrats blocked Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) resolution, condemning Schiff.
Schiff is also accused of fabricating evidence during a congressional hearing -- dialogue that he claimed were words from Trump when they were words Schiff made up.

Meanwhile, the president is calling on Republicans to be stronger in his defense. 
""They have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election. They're lousy politicians, but two things they have - They're vicious, and they stick together. They don't have Mitt Romney in their midst,"" Trump said.
GOP Sen. Mitt Romney has said he's open to impeachment if there's evidence the president held up military aid to Ukraine to fulfill a political purpose.
Democrats continue to defend their decision to hold closed-door sessions with impeachment witnesses and refused to hold a vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry.
Trump and the GOP have argued that it's a requirement since a vote to authorize an ""inquiry"" happened in both the Clinton and Nixon impeachment proceedings."

He has 18 percent of support there while Sen. Elizabeth Warren has climbed to 17 percent and Mayor Pete Buttigieg has 13 percent.
Warren has been gaining momentum in recent weeks, moving up to the top of the Democratic presidential field with her aggressive grassroots campaign and progressive platform that includes Medicare-for-All, bold initiatives to address climate change, and breaking up big banks and big tech.
CBN News recently heard from Warren about her plans, and we also asked what she thinks of revoking the tax-exempt status of churches who don't support same-sex marriage. More about that in a moment. But first, some critics are asking Warren tough questions about how she would pay for her expensive new programs.
 
""Let me tell you where big structural change starts, it starts by tackling corruption head on,"" said Sen. Warren at a recent rally in Norfolk, VA.
 
Speaking to a crowd of about 4,000, Warren laid out plans for canceling student debt and getting rid of college tuition.
 
""We can provide tuition-free technical school, two-year college, four-year college for anyone who wants to get an education,"" continued Warren.  
 
She's promising all this and more through implementing a wealth tax on anyone with more than $50 million in assets. Warren says they would pay an additional two cents for each dollar over 50 million.
 
""Two cents and we can make an investment in an entire generation,"" added Warren.
 
But other candidates challenge her plans and the math – particularly covering Medicare-for-All.
 
""At least Bernie is being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up and I'm sorry Elizabeth but you have not said that,"" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) at last week's debate. ""And I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.""
 
Many attendees at the town hall tell CBN News they're on board with universal health care.
 
""I think that the arguments against giving people a fair shot at health care are ridiculous,"" said Melissa Bowman of Norfolk, VA.
 
""I do think that health care should be something that we consider as a right and not a privilege,"" added Christopher Matthews.
 
And many trust she'll find a way to pay for it.
 
""I think she has a plan and there are much smarter people than me thinking about it,"" said Cody Jefco of Oklahoma.  
 
Even it means higher taxes for the middle class. ""We're already paying it,"" continued Bowman.
 
Other Virginia Democrats still haven't chosen a candidate to support.
 
""I think we need somebody who's able to appeal to those who are more liberal but also more middle of the road, so I don't know who that person is,"" said Monica Agudelo of Norfolk.
 
Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke (D) recently made headlines for his answer on whether or not churches and religious institutions should lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage.
 
""Yes,"" responded O'Rourke. ""There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us. So as president, we're going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.""
 
Warren told CBN News she disagrees.
 
""We have a long tradition in our country of permitting churches to make their own decisions about how they worship. I respect that tradition and I would not change it,"" said Warren.
 
With the first caucuses still a few months away, the question remains if Senator Warren can maintain her steady rise in the polls when it matters most.

The change in plans came two days after Acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney announced during a meeting on Thursday that Doral would host the summit next June.
Mulvaney said the decision to have the summit at Doral came after visiting 10 other sites across the country. He insisted that there would be no profit and that the resort was ""far and away the best physical facility.""

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2019
Trump mentioned that his property could host the summit in August, praising the facilities and its proximity to Miami's international Airport.
Before Trump's announcement, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden criticized Doral as the site for the summit.
""Hosting the G7 at Trump's hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain,"" the former vice president said.
Mulvaney said that unspecified sites in Hawaii and Utah were on the short list - but it was unclear if they were still under consideration"

Taking the podium in the White House briefing room for the first time in his current role, Mick Mulvaney fiercely defended the president. 
""I have news for everybody, get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy,"" he said suggesting the president's July conversation with the president of Ukraine was standard operating procedure.

As a matter of policy, Mulvaney says the president isn't a fan of foreign aid, especially to countries known for corruption. He says while the US was withholding military aid to Ukraine as Trump grew frustrated European countries weren't paying their fair share.
""Did he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that. But that's it and that's why we held up the money,"" Mulvaney told reporters.
Democrats on Capitol Hill quickly pounced, calling Mulvaney's words an admission of the president's guilt.
""Things have just gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) who serves as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
Later Mulvaney accused White House reporters of misconstruing his words to advance a political witch hunt writing, ""Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election."" 
As Mulvaney's words reverberated in Washington, in Dallas, some 20,000 Trump supporters chanted, ""Four more years,"" during a Make America Great Again rally.
The president told supporters House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) hands out subpoenas like they're cookies.
""I have people getting subpoenas I've never heard of. I said who are those people?"" the president asked.
One of those people who has received a subpoena is stepping down. Energy Secretary Rick Perry handed in his resignation Thursday onboard Air Force One with the president as he traveled to Perry's home state of Texas.
President Trump called him a ""terrific guy"" and said he's known for six months that Perry planned to step down at the end of the year.
However, Perry has come under scrutiny over the role he played in Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
Once a skeptic about the need for a federal Department of Energy, in an exclusive interview with CBN News this month, Perry said he's changed his mind and is proud to have played a role in America's break from dependence on foreign oil.
""We've become the number one oil and gas producing country in the world,"" he said.
Perry is one of Trump's longest-serving cabinet members.
Each week he joins Cabinet counterparts for a Bible study led by Capitol Ministries.
""To be with people who share your values. I happen to think it's one of the most consequential things that I do in this administration is to meet with then, to study the Bible, to reflect for this administration, reflect for President Trump that he is surrounded by men and women who are grounded in Judeo-Christian values,"" he tells CBN News.
Perry has been given a deadline of today to hand over documents subpoenaed from House Democrats related to his work in Ukraine."

Pence said there will be a 5-day ceasefire to allow Kurdish troops, who are US allies, to evacuate from the area. He said there's also an agreement to protect religious minorities in northern Syria. After that initial ceasefire, a more enduring ceasefire is going to kick in, based on the negotiations.
“President Erdogan and I spoke at great length about the importance of protecting religious minorities in the region...part of our agreement is to continue to work very closely to ensure that religious minorities can thrive,” Pence said.

Pence said the US and Turkey have ""mutually committed to peaceful resolution."" The agreement was reached after Erdogan was notified that massive sanctions would be implemented against Turkey, but Pence said the US and Turkey will maintain a strong relationship.
""The United States did not support Turkey's military action,"" Pence stated. ""President Trump made that clear.""
He said the United States is committed to implementing a safe zone in northern Syria.
Turkey began invading northern Syria after President Trump began withdrawing US troops from Syria. The president had doubled down to defend his move, downplaying Turkey's military invasion of the region even as his top aides were sent on an emergency mission to try and defuse that growing conflagration inflicted by Turkey's authoritarian leader. 
Now Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo have worked with Turkish leaders to convince them to back down from the bloodshed. 
The meeting in Turkey comes one week after President Trump announced the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria. The move opened the door for Turkey to invade and attack Kurdish forces who are former US allies in the fight against ISIS.
Trump has stood by his decision to withdraw US troops saying it comes down to a land dispute that doesn't involve the United States. He also says he's fulfilling a campaign promise to bring American troops home. ""Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria is not happy about it,"" he said Wednesday. ""Let them work it out.""
Meanwhile, Trump has been facing another type of battle on the home front, tweeting pictures from a heated White House meeting with Democrat leaders Wednesday.

Pelosi said Trump was ""shaken"" by a vote earlier on the House floor to condemn his Syria decision.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) also announced bipartisan sanctions against Turkey. Graham, one of President Trump's closest allies, had tough words for the president on Wednesday's 700 Club.
""I am looking for President Trump to change this. I will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump's worst nightmare,"" Graham had said. ""I will not sit along the sidelines and watch a good ally, the Kurds, be slaughtered by Turkey and watch Iran move in to Syria and become another nightmare for Israel. This is a defining moment for President Trump. He needs to up his game.""
Trump fired back after he heard Graham's comments. ""Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years,"" said Trump.  
On the ground in Syria, the Kurds claim Turkish forces are using banned chemical weapons, like napalm and white phosphorous.
Meanwhile, more than 100,000 refugees need help. CBN's Operation Blessing is working with the Barzani Charity Foundation to provide relief, including thousands of boxes of food, cases of water, blankets, baby formula and hygiene kits.
Late Wednesday, Trump released a letter he sent to Erdogan last week.

The US congressman from Maryland died at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges, his congressional office said. He was 68.
As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, he was central in the Democrats' efforts to impeach President Trump.
He publicly sparred with the president and led numerous investigations into the president, his family, and his financial records.    
His widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings said in a statement, ""Congressman Cummings was an honorable man who proudly served his district and the nation with dignity, integrity, compassion and humility. He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our problem.""
One of his political rivals in Congress, Trey Gowdy, honored Cummings with a powerful tribute on Twitter:
His legacy is making sure there were fewer obstacles for the next Elijah Cummings. His legacy to me, above all else, was his faith. A faith in God that is being rewarded today with no more fights, no more battles, and no more pain.
— Trey Gowdy (@TGowdySC) October 17, 2019
Cummings was a sharecropper's son who rose to become one of the most powerful members of the US Congress.
The Associated Press reports that when Cummings was in grade school, a counselor told him he was too slow to learn and spoke too poorly to become a lawyer which was his dream. That compelled Cummings to fight hard to achieve his goal. ""I was devastated,"" Cummings told the AP in 1996, shortly before he won his seat in Congress. ""My whole life changed. I became very determined.""
He was a fiery voice in Congress, supporters praising him for highlighting the struggles and needs of inner-city residents.
Cummings had been temporarily away from Congress after an unspecified medical procedure. In recent years he had undergone treatment for heart and knee issues.

His comments come as Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo head out to the region to try to negotiate a cease-fire with Turkey's authoritarian leader, President Erdogan.

But there has been some back-and-forth today on whether Erdogan will actually take a meeting with the Trump administration team. 
Meanwhile here in Washington, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are weighing the next steps when it comes to the situation in Syria.
 
Many, from both sides of aisles, disagree with the president and want to see more actions against Turkey as a result of the attacks. The House of Representatives has even passed a resolution condemning Trump's troop withdrawal.
Since the president's surprise announcement to remove those troops serving in Syria, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has been a vocal opponent on the issue, challenging President Trump to find a solution to the new problem that's unfolding in Syria right now.
Sen. Graham said, ""I'm going to introduce sanctions tomorrow with Democrats that are going to be sanctions from Hell. They're going to be like Iranian sanctions against Turkey, I'm going to break this thug's back, we're going to stand by the military, and to President Trump, if you're listening to this interview, if you remove all of our forces from Syria, you're throwing the Kurds over, ISIS will come back on your watch, and Iran will take over and you my friend, will be in great jeopardy of losing the election. We can't afford you to lose.""
Graham continued, ""The President's put sanctions on but I'm going to go further. My sanctions would sanction Erdogan and his family and find out how much money he's stolen from the Turkish people. My sanctions would go after their energy sector where they get most of their money. It would take the two top Turkish banks in the world and say you can't do business with those banks as long as Erdogan's in Syria.""
""They're a NATO ally, I'd like to have a good relationship, but we're not going to let Erdogan slaughter the allies that helped us defeat ISIS, the Kurds. We're not going to give Iran part of Syria to make a nightmare for Israel, and at the end of the day my friend, this is a defining moment for President Trump,"" Graham said."

At the Capitol, Pelosi is holding firm in her position that the House will not hold an official vote on the impeachment inquiry. ""They can't defend the president, so they're going to process. We're not going there,"" she said.
Republicans say Democrats are not following a fair impeachment investigation. ""House Democrats have wasted no time throwing fairness and precedent to the wind,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). 
""Already, they've denied their Republican counterparts certain minority rights like equal subpoena power that Republicans provided Democrats during the Clinton impeachment,"" he continued.
The office of Vice President Mike Pence says he won't hand over documents involving Ukraine, and Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani says he doesn't plan to submit documents in compliance with a congressional subpoena.
The White House Budget Office says, it, too, will not comply with a subpoena.
Meanwhile, a New York Times report says former top Russia advisor Fiona Hill testified that former National Security Advisor John Bolton was extremely concerned about Giuliani's activities in Ukraine.
Giuliani is accused of engaging in a rogue operation to get Ukraine to investigate whether Joe Biden and his son Hunter were involved in corruption regarding Hunter's ability to gain a key position with a Ukrainian energy company.
Hunter Biden says he did not do anything unethical in taking a position with that Ukrainian company, but he told ABC News that he might not have gotten the job if his last name wasn't Biden.
""I thought he really made a big gaffe when he basically said that, 'Yeah, my last name does mean something, and Burisma did hire me because my name is Biden',"" commented CBN News chief political analyst David Brody on CBN News' Faith Nation. 
""Well, if that's the case, then what Trump and Giuliani have been saying all along, which is, 'Exactly, you were hired because your last name is Biden, so therefore, what did they expect when they hired you? What did Burisma expect?'"" Brody continued.
""And I think that's where Trump wants to go with the corruption angle here, and that is something that they want to see investigated,"" he added.
More administration officials are expected to testify in coming days, including US ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, over text messages sent between him and administration officials in Ukraine."

It became pretty clear from the start of this Democrat debate that the newly crowned front-runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was in for some friendly fire.
 
""We heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer,"" said Mayor Pete Buttigieg after Warren seemed to dodge a question on whether her Medicare for All plan would increase taxes on the middle class. 
 
""Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families,"" Warren declared.  
 
Warren's declaration wouldn't get her off the hook, instead prompting a sharp retort from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). ""At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,"" said Klobuchar. 
 
But there was plenty of heat to go around. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and fellow servicemember Mayor Pete Buttigieg sparred over the president's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria. 
 
""Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war,"" said Gabbard.  
 
However, South Bend, Indiana mayor Buttigieg redirected the blame to President Trump. 
 
""Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong.  The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence.  It's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,"" said Buttigieg. 
 
Buttigieg also took on former Congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) over gun control and his proposal for mandatory buybacks.
 
""We don't go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law.  I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, non-gun-owners alike to respect and follow the law,"" O'Rourke explained. 
 
""Look, Congressman, you just made it clear that you don't know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets,"" accused Buttigieg.  
 
On a night where the Ukraine controversy dominated the headlines, Vice President Joe Biden addressed the issue early on. 
 
""Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine.  And that's what we should be focusing on,"" said Biden. 
 
In a break from the charged discussion, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) thanked his counterparts and the American people for their concern over his recent heart attack. 
""Let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening,"" said Sanders. 
 
With the fourth debate on the books, the candidates can breathe easier for a moment. However, it only gets harder from here. The next debate will require 3 percent in four DNC-approved polls and donations from 165,000 unique donors. So far, key candidates such as O'Rourke, Klobuchar, and Gabbard haven't made the cut.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Tuesday that she's not going to call for a formal House vote on impeachment.
Trump calls the impeachment inquiry ""illegitimate"" and says the House needs to go on the record with a vote. Republicans want to put politically vulnerable Democrats in a tight position in areas where the president remains popular.
Pelosi counters that Congress is well within its authority to investigate as part of its oversight role. The Constitution gives the House impeachment powers but provides little guidance on the process.

Hunter Biden is denying claims by President Trump and his Republican allies who question how he gained access to foreign positions in Ukraine and China. He now says he probably overlooked the potential impact it could have on his father's political career.
During a new interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden admits that he might have made a mistake for failing to consider the effects of his foreign involvement. 
""Did I make a mistake based on some ethical lapse? Absolutely not. I don't think there's a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn't Biden,"" he said.
Joe Biden discussed the issue over the weekend, promising to ban family members from holding any office within the White House if he is elected. 
But Biden has yet to respond to Trump's allegations while facing a national debate audience.
Bernie Sanders will likely be asked about his health after his recent heart attack.
Also, Elizabeth Warren may face questions over whether or not her health care plan would mean higher taxes for the middle class - a question critics say she has dodged.

""Unless we bow down and accept their agenda as it relates to the LGBTQ agenda, then they'll take our tax exempt status, and everybody in the room cheered and clapped when he said that. And of course the other candidates clapped and cheered as well. And that just shows you where their heart is and where they're going to go.""
Graham says this is not about being against a group of people. Instead, it's about sharing the true freedom and hope that come from following God's ways that are made clear in the Bible.

""I'm not anti-gay, I'm not going out speaking against gay people, fighting gay people or anything like that, but I certainly don't want them to force their agenda on me to where I have to accept what they say is truth. It's not. It's a sin. And I care for gay people, love them enough to warn them that if they don't repent and turn from their sin, God will judge them. And God will judge sin, whether we are liars or thieves, all of us are sinners and we have to repent and turn from our sin,"" he explained.
""And so I want the gay and lesbian people to know that if they repent and turn from those sins, God will forgive them and heal their hearts. But I'm not going to accept it and say what they're doing is fine. It's not fine. It's not fine with God and they'll stand before him one day,"" he continued.

First, at-bat Monday is President Trump's former Russia Ambassador Fiona Hill who testified in front of lawmakers behind closed doors. 
Hill resigned as President Trump's top Russia analyst days before the now-infamous phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.
House Democrats want to know if Trump withheld $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to get them to investigate the Bidens.
""Impeachment. I never thought I'd see or hear that word with regard to me,"" Trump said.
Trump addressed an audience of enthusiastic Evangelical Christians at the Values Voter Summit Saturday night in Washington. 
It's there he denied pressuring Ukraine to investigate a 2020 political rival.
""The text message that I saw from Ambassador Sondland – who is highly respected – was, there's ""no quid pro quo,"" said Trump. ""He said that.""
Gordon Sondland is under subpoena and will be asked about those texts with the President.
The US Ambassador to the EU is expected to testify later this week over the objections of the State Department. 
""Let me say I'm delighted he is coming in,"" said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY) ""I'm anticipating hearing what he has to say because he's certainly key.""
This, as Hunter Biden announced he will step down from the board of a Chinese company.
He also pledged not to work on behalf of any foreign company if his father is elected to the presidency. 
""No one, no one has indicated of any consequence that anything was done wrong or illegally by me or my son,"" Joe Biden said. 
The President renewed his call to unmask the whistleblower and have them testify publicly on Capitol Hill.
But House Intel Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) says the whistleblower's testimony may no longer be necessary given that the White House released the call record, a phone conversation the whistleblower did not hear firsthand. "

Trump said McAleenan wanted to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.
“We have worked well together with Border Crossings being Way down,” Trump tweeted.
His departure creates yet another top-level vacancy in Trump’s Cabinet — at the department responsible not only for immigration enforcement but also for helping states secure elections.
McAleenan said in a subsequent tweet that he wanted to thank the president for his support and that he’d work with the Department of Homeland Security on a smooth transition.
He took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen quit, and he was the fourth person to lead the department in two years. Trump hasn’t named anyone to the job yet — the acting deputy is David Pekoske, the head of the Transportation Security Administration.
McAleenan, a longtime U.S. Customs, and Border Protection official, was seen as a level head who could effectively manage the border crisis, but like many other former administration officials who came before, Trump eventually soured on him.
His tenure was marked by internal squabbling and jockeying by others in the department vying for top jobs, all playing out against a backdrop of outrage and horror amid reports of children being held in squalid conditions and images of those who perished trying to make the trek.
The 240,000-person department is tasked with election security and cybersecurity, disaster response and even the Secret Service. But for Trump, the Department of Homeland Security means one thing: immigration. The president’s signature issue makes the department his focus and his ire. Balancing a White House eager to push major changes with the reality on the ground is a constant challenge.
McAleenan, who has years of experience with border issues, was seen initially in Trump’s circle as someone who could get control over the crisis, despite his stance as a moderate who pushed for aid to be restored to Central American nations.

His speech comes as there's a growing concern in his evangelical base over his decision to pull troops out of Syria because it leaves US allies like the Kurds and Syrian Christians without protection. 
As the president shows no signs of changing his mind when it comes to pulling US troops out of Syria, his evangelical base, which played a key role in sending him to the White House in 2016, is speaking out and letting him know they do not support him in the pullout.
""It's going to probably go down as the worst decision of his presidency,"" conference attendee Noah Brandt from Missouri told CBN News.
Many at the summit fear that the US pulling support out of Syria will put religious minorities and our Kurdish allies in imminent danger. 
""I was talking with a lot of people last night and people were saying this is the first time that President Trump has done something that they really disagree with,"" said Anna Kepes from Illinois
Brandt told CBN News he also has concerns about the president's phone call with the president of Ukraine.
""I don't think that the president of the United States should be using his political power to try to hurt his political opponents. And I think that even a charitable reading of the transcript shows that's probably what President Trump was trying to do.""
And while he thinks an inquiry is alright, he doesn't think House Democrats should lead it.
""There might be some smoke for this one, but I don't know if they can be trusted based on what they've done in the past,"" he remarked. 
Other attendees condemned the inquiry.
""There's really nothing that President Trump has done that's glaringly wrong,"" one attendee told CBN News. 
""I think it's less an impeachment inquiry as it is a political movement to try and obfuscate the facts that are true,"" said Mike Oakley from Alabama
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) agrees. 
""They're not seeking the truth,"" Meadows told the summit's audience Friday. ""They're seeking a narrative. A narrative they've already written the conclusion to.""
Meadows criticized House Democrats for their lack of transparency in the process.
""Even before this president was sworn in, they were bound and determined to do it and we need to send a clear message if they do it we will send them home,"" he said.
One thing all attendees at the summit cheered for - a call to pray.
""I'm here to tell you that our nation will be healed with committed believers and people on their knees before the Heavenly Father praying for our land each and every day,"" Meadows said. 
In addition to growing concern amongst his evangelical base on his decision on Syria, Trump is also facing mounting pressure from lawmakers in his own party to change his mind. "

Her appearance could signal a breakthrough as lawmakers look into whether Trump committed impeachable offenses by asking a foreign country to investigate a potential 2020 political rival. 
""They know they can't win the 2020 election so they are pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt,"" Trump said.

Also on Friday, two associates of Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani were taken into custody.
""They were about to board an international flight with one-way tickets,"" US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Jeffrey Berman said. 
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were allegedly involved in Giuliani's efforts to investigate the dealings of Joe Biden's son, Hunter.
""The defendants broke the law to gain political influence while avoiding disclosure of who was actually making the donations and where the money was coming from,"" Berman said. 
Prosecutors say the men were not only scheming to use foreign money to influence US elections, but they were also trying to get Yovanovich fired from her post. 
This news comes as House Democrats subpoenaed Energy Secretary Rick Perry's documents pertaining to his Ukraine visit.
Perry spoke exclusively to CBN News about the matter.
""I never heard, and I talked to the president about this,"" Perry said. I had a conversation with - a phone call - with Rudy Guiliani about it. I've talked to the previous ambassador. I've talked to the current ambassador. I've talked to Kurt Volker, Gordan Sondland, the EU ambassador- every name that you've seen out in the media and not once, not once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son ever mentioned.""
Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, is now set to testify next Thursday after receiving a subpoena. 
Earlier this week, the White House demanded that Sondland not talk to lawmakers. 
Meanwhile, President Trump's finances could face a lot more scrutiny soon. A federal appeals court has ruled that his financial records must be turned over to the House of Representatives."

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke shocked even some fellow liberal politicians like Pete Buttigieg last week when he said churches should lose their tax-exempt status if they don't support gay marriage. Now he's trying to backpedal those comments.
At a CNN Democratic town hall debate Thursday night,  O'Rourke was asked, ""Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, and charities should lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage?""

Sen. Sasse Slaps O'Rourke's 'Extreme Intolerance'
O'Rourke's comments immediately drew backlash from conservatives. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) released a statement Friday condemning O'Rourke for ""extreme intolerance.""
""This bigoted nonsense would target a lot of sincere Christians, Jews, and Muslims,"" wrote Sasse. ""Leaders from both parties have a duty to flatly condemn this attack on very basic American freedoms.""
""This extreme intolerance is un-American,"" Sasse went on. ""The whole point of the First Amendment is that…everyone is created with dignity and we don't use government power to decide which religious beliefs are legitimate and which aren't.""
Dr. Dobson and Others Call Out Democrat War on Religious Liberty
Dr. James Dobson, president of the James Dobson Family Institute, responded to the Democrats calls for a cultural war on religious liberty.
""Last night, presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke pledged that, if elected, he would seek to strip 501(c)(3) tax exemptions from religious groups that hold to biblical views on human sexuality and marriage. Unfortunately, he's not the only one,"" Dobson said in a statement released Friday.  
""Where it was once reasonably expected for all government officials to embrace the First Amendment and defend the freedoms of expression and belief, we are now witnessing the steady deterioration of such bipartisan unity in regard to our most sacredly held freedoms. Certain House Democrats are also boldly pledging their own cultural war on our religious liberties, in direct conflict to the Constitution they claim to serve,"" Dobson continued.
""This outright attack on religious freedom is disgraceful and should prompt an outcry from all advocates of true tolerance and diversity,"" he said. ""The vast majority of Americans recognize and cherish the freedoms that fortify the foundation of this nation. We should expect and demand our elected officials do the same.""
Luke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel for Becket Law, chimed in during the town hall, tweeting, ""Stripping tax-exempt status from religious groups, solely because of their religious belief in traditional marriage, would be a major attack on #ReligiousFreedom.""
""If one of these candidates has the burden of governing this whole diverse, complex country, I would hope they wouldn't be as flippant as they're being during this campaign so far when it comes to that real stake that religious freedom has in these conversations,"" Michael Wear, chief strategist for the And Campaign told Deseret.com. 
Beto Backtracks After Backlash, Even from Buttigieg
O'Rourke's reply also drew negative reactions from liberals like fellow 2020 presidential contender Pete Buttigieg who is gay himself.
""I agree that anti-discrimination law should be applied to all institutions, but the idea that you are going to strip churches of their tax-exempt status if they haven't found their way to blessing same sex marriage, I am not sure he understood the implications of what he was saying. That means going to war, not only with churches, but with mosques and a lot of organizations that may not have the same view of various religious principles I do,"" Buttigieg told CNN.
The O'Rourke campaign e-mailed the online magazine Slate with a response to all the backlash saying, ""(Beto) would support revoking the tax exempt status for a religious institution that fired an employee or refused to hire someone b/c they were in a same-sex marriage. He would not, however, revoke tax-exempt status for a religious organization he simply disagree (sic) with.""
Social Media Snark
Social media users also fired away at O'Rourke for his comments intended to sway the LGBTQ vote. Some reminded him about the US Constitution that if elected as president, he would have to vow to defend, protect and uphold. 
A user identified as James Bolfik replied, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""
Another user wrote, ""@BetoORourke say hello to Fascism, what color boots will the stormtroopers wear when they kick the church doors in?""
Another user brought up the Constitution writing, ""May not play well with the constitution.  All that annoying stuff about the government telling citizens what religious beliefs they should have.  And stuff.""
The outrage was widespread with a seemingly endless amount of condemnation for Beto's attack on religious freedom.
One user also brought up basic American freedoms, writing, ""I think it would be quicker for  @BetoORourke to name the freedoms he actually believes in than to name the freedoms he wants to take away.""
A user with the name of Bringbackcommonsense wrote, ""This man needs prayer. He has no understanding of the word of God. May God have mercy on his soul and open his eyes to his sin and ignorance."" 
Still another user replied, ""I hope he's better at selling furniture."""

These 3 Democrats Lead the Field as Trump Battles Impeachment,"It's being seen as a game-changer for the Democratic Party: now three of the remaining 19 candidates have pulled away from the rest, clawing their way to the top of the 2020 presidential campaign.
The big gainer? Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. 
Joe Biden, who's been caught up in the web of President Trump's impeachment inquiry, is right there with Warren at the top. 
And even after a heart attack, self-described socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders is hot on their trail.
Biden has held a steady lead in polling but has seen a drop in third-quarter fundraising. Now Warren is topping the former vice president in some polls, and at just over $25 million, Warren pulled in the biggest pile of cash last quarter out of the nearly 20 candidates. 
Close behind, Sanders pulled in just under $25 million and is leading the 16 other candidates in most polls.
Biden's $15 million draw puts him in fourth place behind candidate Pete Buttigieg in the money game for the 2020 White House run.
Energizing her campaign, chants of ""two cents"" have become a frequent rallying cry at Warren campaign events. Warren's wealth tax of two cents on the dollar amounts to an annual two-per-cent tax on wealth over $50 million, and would require ultra-wealthy Americans to ""pitch in two cents so everybody has a chance to make it in America,"" said Warren. 
Sanders has an even more aggressive tax plan on extreme wealth, and both are favorites among liberal voters. 
But with Warren winning three out of four recent polls, moderate voters are taking Warren's two cents seriously.
""She's trying to be the tortoise in the race,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor, and publisher of ""Inside Elections.""
On CBN News' ""Faith Nation,"" Gonzalez attributed Warren's rise to a slow and steady campaign strategy.  
""It's still complicated,"" he added. ""As long as Bernie Sanders is in the race, it's complicated for her to overtake Vice President Biden, but we have a long way to go."" 
If slow and steady wins the race, Sanders could be in luck. 
Days after suffering a heart attack, the 78-year-old was planning to slow his campaign, but that didn't stop the Vermont senator's campaign from releasing a plan to ban corporate money from politics. 
""Let's break them up,"" said Warren at a recent union event in Los Angeles.
The 70-year-old Massachusetts senator wants to break up big tech giants that she says are violating anti-trust laws. 
At the same event, Warren's 76-year-old rival and former vice president took on Wall Street. 
 
""Wall Street did not build America, the middle class built America and unions built the middle class, period,"" said Biden. 
Wall Street is a familiar punching bag for all the Democrats and Biden's perch at the top of the field relies in part on his appeal to blue-collar Democrats.
The former VP may be against some far-left plans like Medicare-for-All, but has pledged to eliminate President Trump's tax cuts. 
For that and for his top-dog status, Biden has become Trump's favorite target.
""I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden,"" said President Trump recently on the White House South Lawn.
Biden's name is now mentioned almost daily because of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump for pressuring Ukraine's president to investigate the Biden family.
""This guy, like all bullies, is a coward. He does not want to run against me,"" said Biden of the 73-year-old President Trump. 
Biden calls the pay-to-play allegations in Ukraine unfounded, and said recently that ""this is not about me, this is not about my son.""
Democrats in the bottom tier of the race are taking advantage of Biden's Ukraine problem by keeping their fire trained on Trump. 
""This president has basically put his own business interests, his own political interests, his own partisan interests, in front of this country,"" said presidential candidate and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Sen. Kamala Harris, the presidential candidate from California, said, ""Let's be clear, essentially what we've got here, is a walking indictment walking in a red tie."""

The news website The Hill reports a ""large-scale grassroots"" effort that includes all forms of media.
It also includes a massive canvassing of 5 million voters and will target key swing states including, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. These states are must-win states for Trump. 
Kelley Robinson of Planned Parenthood Vote told The Hill the stakes are higher than ever.
""We're coming out more powerfully than ever with the largest investment we've ever made,"" Robinson said. 
She also says the campaign will focus on telling people there is a ""coordinated attack"" by Republicans to overturn the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.
The announcement comes after a turbulent year for the abortion provider. 
As CBN News reported in August, Planned Parenthood left the federal family planning program rather than abide by a new Trump administration rule prohibiting participants from referring patients for abortions. This move cost Planned Parenthood $60 million a year in funding. It's clear the abortion provider rejected the Title X funding for one reason: So that it can continue to refer pregnant women for abortions.
Pro-life advocates called the funding cut a win, but they say the decision by the abortion provider exposes their true colors.
Former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson said, ""They don't really care if they don't receive Title 10 money because their primary focus is not women's health care. Their primary focus is abortion.""
In July, the abortion provider removed Dr. Leana Wen as its president, less than a year after she was chosen to lead the organization.
When she was fired Wen said it was because she wanted to shift Planned Parenthood to put women's health first, rather than abortion. 
Wen wrote at the time, ""The new board leadership has determined that the priority of Planned Parenthood moving forward is to double down on abortion rights advocacy.""
Several states also passed bans or restrictions on abortion this year. 
The abortion provider's announcement also comes right after the Supreme Court said it would hear its first abortion case in three years. Court watchers say with the two new conservative justices appointed by President Trump joining the high court, the court's final decision expected next summer could affect abortion access in the US for many years.

The July phone call embarrassed Zelenskiy because it showed him as eager to please Trump and critical of European partners whose support he needs to strengthen Ukraine's economy and to end the conflict with Russia.
Zelenskiy said it was ""wrong"" of the White House to publish a rough transcript of the call and he will not publish the Ukrainian transcript. He said he ""didn't even check"" whether the Ukrainian transcript is the same, but ""I think they match.""
Trump has said the United States has an ""absolute right"" to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases.
Ukraine's top prosecutor last week said his office would review several cases related to the owner of the gas company where former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden sat on the board. And Zelenskiy on Thursday invited US and Ukrainian prosecutors to cooperate but insisted he would not interfere.

If you watch President Trump's rally there on Thursday, look for Minneapolis police officers standing behind him. They'll be very easy to spot. They'll all be wearing red t-shirts instead of their uniforms due to a brand new department policy. 
So why are the police officers not wearing their uniforms? It all started after Trump announced he would hold the Minneapolis rally, his first campaign event since House Democrats announced an impeachment inquiry against him. The North Star state is expected to be a big battleground in the 2020 presidential campaign. A day after Trump announced the event, a new policy was handed down which bars off-duty police officers from wearing their uniforms to political events.

2nd Trump Whistleblower Comes Forward After Speaking to Inspector General
The head of the local police union immediately cried foul, saying it was a political move by Democrat city officials. 
Police spokesman John Elder told USA Today the new rule was put in place to prevent the department's officers from showing political bias and for the public from becoming ""confused."" 
""The uniform gets translated back to the average person as someone being from the police department,"" he said. ""It's very confusing for people when they see someone in uniform to understand the difference between the city and the federation."" 
But Lt. Bob Kroll, president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis told USA Today it's clear to him that politics are behind the rule change. 
After Trump's rally was announced, Mayor Jacob Frey released a statement in which he called the President's actions ""reprehensible.""
""Under ordinary circumstances, it would be an honor to welcome a sitting President of the United States to Minneapolis and to showcase all our city has to offer on the national stage,"" Frey said in the statement. ""But these aren't ordinary circumstances. Since taking office President Trump's actions have been reprehensible and his rhetoric has made it clear that he does not value the perspectives or rights of Minneapolis' diverse communities.""
Both Frey and Elder said police officials have been working on the rule change for months before Trump announced the Minneapolis rally.
Kroll said the timing of the rule change announcement was ""very conspicuous.""
So police officers who support the president will now wear t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan ""Cops for Trump."" The shirt features an American flag in the shape of Minnesota. All proceeds from the sale of the shirts will go toward the police union's charity. 
President Trump, a big supporter of law enforcement professionals, likes to feature local officers behind him at events. 
Trump tweeted about the shirts and wrote he wants to bring some back to Washington with him.
""Thank you to Lt. Bob Kroll of the great Minneapolis Police Department for your kind words on @foxandfriends. The Police are fighting the Radical Left Mayor and his ridiculous Uniform Ban. Actually, I LOVE the Cops for Trump shirts. Want to bring some home. I am with you 100%!!!!,"" the president tweeted.

Minneapolis city officials also had a few words with the Trump campaign on who was going to cover the costs of the President's rally at the Target Center. 
According to The Washington Post, city officials told the Target Center that it would be responsible for a whopping $530,000 security bill the city says it needs in order to provide security for Trump's visit. 
The arena then threatened to cancel the rally unless the Trump campaign paid the bill. This angered Trump's team which accused Mayor Frey of trying to stop the rally. It was only after the campaign threatened to sue the arena's owners that the bill was rescinded. 
According to The Post, campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote in an email to supporters. ""The Target Center has backed off canceling the contract, which means President Trump's Keep America Great rally will go on as scheduled. Consistent with our original agreement with the venue, the Trump campaign has not agreed to pay any additional funds.""
Trump tweeted, ""Someone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can't price out Free Speech. Probably illegal! I stand strongly & proudly with the great Police Officers and Law Enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota! See you Thursday Night!

Thousands of evangelicals will be on hand to hear from the Commander-in-Chief at the event run by the conservative Family Research Council. Trump spoke at the event back in 2017 and Vice President Mike Pence addressed the crowd last year.
Typically, when President Trump speaks to evangelical audiences, he receives multiple standing ovations. This Saturday will probably be more of the same because, even with the swirl of impeachment surrounding him, evangelicals have stood solidly behind the president so far. His remarks also come at a time where evangelical leaders have expressed concern about U.S. troop withdrawal from Northeastern Syria. They believe the move by Trump leaves religious minorities in the region, including many Christians, as easy targets for slaughter by the Turkish Government.  
President Trump will have an opportunity to explain his reasoning in front of this all-important voting block.

""Our interest was always and still is trying to help Ukraine become as independent as it can be from an energy standpoint. They've been held hostage by Russians, by Russian gas,"" he explains.
Now comes word from President Trump that the infamous phone call with the Ukrainian president came at Perry's urging.
In a statement to CBN News, Perry's spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes says, ""Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the president to speak to the new president of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development.""
In our interview, Perry told CBN News he's personally discussed Ukrainian corruption with President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and several ambassadors.
We asked if former Vice President Joe Biden ever factored into his conversations.
""Not once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son - ever mentioned. Corruption was talked about in the country, but it was always a relatively vague term of, you know, the oligarchs and this and that and what have you. But I'm quite comfortable. Matter of fact, I'm extremely comfortable that not once did the president of the United States, or any of his administration or his team ever talk about with the intent there was some quid pro quo,"" he explains.
Instead, he says, the administration is intensely focused on getting Ukraine to clean up its own business culture.
""The message was clear, you clean up the corruption and the United States will be certainly willing to come in and help you. I can't go in good faith and tell a US company, go and invest here, go and be involved if the corruption is ongoing,"" Perry says.
Despite all the scrutiny, the secretary traveled to Lithuania Sunday to meet with Ukrainian and other regional leaders to discuss energy security.
""I think this is obviously the continued attempt to take this president any way they can because they don't like the way the election turned out in 2016,"" he surmises.
Regardless, Perry will likely remain under a microscope for the foreseeable future.

A press secretary told ABC News, ""It doesn't matter how many people decide to call themselves whistleblowers about the same telephone call – a call the president already made public.""
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is perhaps defending the president most strongly. He says the accusations against Trump look like a ""political set-up"" and said there was nothing wrong with his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry will continue to hear from witnesses this week. Two State Department experts on Ukraine are scheduled to appear, but it's unclear whether they will, given the objections from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Rick Perry Explains 'Expansive Relationship' With Ukraine: 'God as My Witness Not Once Was Biden Mentioned',"WASHINGTON – When it comes to dealings with Ukraine, Energy Secretary Rick Perry says he probably has the most expansive relationships as any cabinet secretary but says he's never heard former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter come up in conversation. 
Secretary Perry discussed his dealings during an exclusive interview with CBN News Friday.
""This has been a very intense, a very focused push to get Ukraine to clean up the corruption. It's a very well known fact that this was historically a corrupt place and the message was clear: you clean up the corruption and the United States will be certainly willing to come in and help you,"" Perry explained.
""I can't go in good faith and tell a US company, go and invest here, go and be involved if the corruption is ongoing,"" he added.
Perry says he never heard anyone ever bring up former Vice President Joe Biden or his son Hunter.
""I never heard, and I talked to the president about this,"" he told CBN News. ""I had a conversation with - a phone call - with Rudy Guiliani about it. I've talked to the previous ambassador. I've talked to the current ambassador. I've talked to Kurt Volker, Gordan Sondland, the EU ambassador- every name that you've seen out in the media and not once, not once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name - not the former vice president, not his son ever mentioned. Corruption was talked about in the country but it was always a relatively vague term of, you know, the oligarchs and this and that and what have you.""
Perry said he ""got very comfortable"" that President Volodymyr Zelensky's and his team were committed to cleaning up corruption in their country and helping the county move forward economically.
""Our interest was always and still is trying to help Ukraine become as independent as it can be from an energy standpoint. They've been held hostage by Russians, by Russian gas. The Russians literally have cut the gas off to Ukraine. They have attacked their utilities with cyberattacks,"" he noted.
The House Oversight Committee wants to learn more about Perry's trip to Ukraine for President Zolensky's inauguration, along with other meetings.
The secretary says he'll cooperate fully with Congress.
On Friday, House investigators released dozens of text messages from a diplomat in Ukraine discussing President Trump's request the country launch an investigation into Biden's family. 
The texts suggest Ukraine's new president would get a high profile visit to Washington in return for launching the investigation. 
The latest revelations come as President Trump is now publicly calling on both Ukraine and China to investigate Biden.
Meanwhile, media reports indicate Perry plans to leave his post next month. During the 2016 presidential debates, then-candidate Perry famously called for the elimination of a number of federal agencies including the one he currently runs.
Now nearly three years into the job, Perry says he's grown to view the Department of Energy as an asset to the nation.
""Wisdom comes in a lot of different forms. The Bible tells us that the fear of God is a real form of wisdom and another form of wisdom, I would suggest to you, is learning when you've made a mistake and in this case doing away with the Department of Energy was one of those wise moments for me,"" he explained. ""The reason is, as I came in, as I became very educated about what the agency does, I found an amazing group of men and women, very committed to their roles.""
Perry's impressed that some 40 percent of the agency staff are veterans and now brags on the work they do, especially when it comes to innovation and security.
""There's 17 national labs working on everything from artificial intelligence that's going to have a big impact on our health care system, being able to find cures for cancer, for traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress,"" he listed. ""Just some fascinating work that's being done there because of the supercomputers that we operate. The weapons side of our program. Making sure these weapons are safe, that they're modern. That's a very important role that the department has as well,"" he said.

""Women For Trump"" – that's the motto the campaign is pushing at gatherings across the country designed to mobilize women and promote President Trump's agenda. 
The campaign held 13 of these ""Coast to Coast"" gatherings on one August evening, all of them in battleground states the campaign knows it needs to win and where Republicans lost significant ground in the 2018 midterm elections. 
Gabby Orr, White House reporter for Politico, was the first to report on the story.  
""They're doing a lot behind the scenes,"" Orr told CBN's Faith Nation. ""Their main goal is to bring females who are supportive of the president to campaign events where they can interact with spokespeople for the campaign like Kayleigh McEnany, surrogates who are very pro-Trump – Kellyanne Conway is another one of them – and encourage them to go back to their communities and talk about all of the accomplishments of this administration and communicate to their neighbors, to fellow women, why they think it's worth supporting the president for a second term."" 
Kayleigh McEnany, press secretary for the Trump Campaign says women have benefited greatly under Trump. 
""We have a president, the first Republican president in history, first president of either party, actually to put in his plan paid family leave,"" McEnany said on Faith Nation.
She also pointed to women's unemployment which is at a 65-year low under Trump. 
""The numbers and facts tell the story, so we're trying to blow past the media narrative and get the facts out there to females across the country,"" said McEnany. 
Many of the states eyed by the Trump campaign were won by Democrats in 2018, in large part due to suburban women. Exit polls from CNN found women backed Democrats over Republicans by 19 percent, the largest gap in more than three decades. 
Fast-forward to 2020, where a recent NBC News-Wall Street Journal Poll found a generic Democrat beating Trump by six points among non-college educated white women. That's a demographic he carried by 27 percent in 2016. In that same poll, Trump falls 33 percent behind with college-educated white women. 
Still, McEnany thinks there are quite a few women ""closet voters"" out there. 
""There's still that contingency of hidden Trump voters who many happen to be women, who might not talk to a pollster or talk to the media, but nevertheless, know the president's right for their family and will vote for him,"" she said. 
Closet voters or not, the Trump campaign says another purpose of these ""Coast to Coast"" events is to encourage women who might otherwise be reluctant to publicly declare their support for Trump. "

Rick Perry's Oval Office Prophecy Comes True: 'God Has a Plan, Just Be Faithful'","WASHINGTON – Energy Secretary Rick Perry is having a good day. This afternoon he witnessed the fulfillment of a prophecy in his life, one he wasn't sure would ever come true.
""Fascinating story,"" he tells CBN News during an exclusive interview in Washington Friday morning. 
""In 2011, I was in the process of deciding whether I was going to run for president, and a dear friend of mine, a great Christian brother named Dr. Charles Gordon, said, 'Hey, I had a friend who shared with me a vision of you, a prophecy about you in the White House, in the Oval Office, with your grandson'."" 
At the time Perry's son was married but didn't have any children.
""But I knew I was planning on being the next president of the United States, so shoot, I knew how to take that, right?"" Sec. Perry added with a smile.
But it didn't quite work out that way.
 
""As I tell people if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans,"" he continued.
His 2012 run for the White House fizzled.
""My son in 2013 does have a child. Well, I know it's gonna be a boy, right?"" he says. 
Wrong.
""Out came Ella Perry. And I thought well there's time to have more children. 2015, February, a second child comes. It's Piper, another little girl,"" he says.
And by September of 2015 Perry says he, ""read the tea leaves pretty well"" and realized he wasn't going to be elected president.  
Still, he never forgot that prophecy.
""It never shook my faith, but it was kinda like well, 'you know, maybe this lady was just wrong,' maybe she's not a prophet',"" he recalls.
But then on Independence Day of this year, Perry's long-awaited grandson was born, and today that prophesy from 2011 became truth.
""So, Griffin James Perry, his nickname is Finn, he will go into the White House, into the Oval Office, with the president of the United States,"" Perry says with a smile.
""Your plans often aren't God's plans, but be faithful. His plan's better,"" Perry says.
""Looking back on it, my plan was to be president of the United States. Tried twice. It didn't work out that way. God has a plan. You know, just don't be frustrated. Just be faithful,"" he continues.
And someday when Finn looks back on the photo of he and his grandfather in the Oval Office with the president... ""He'll go, my grandfather, he was a pretty cool guy,"" Perry says.

Luria took a big political risk when she recently called for an impeachment inquiry with six other freshman colleagues. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi officially announced the House would pursue an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump shortly after their op-ed was published. The former Navy commander is back in her district this week seeing how her constituents feel about her bold decision. 
 
""The people who have come up to me have said you know we support you, thank you for being strong, thank you for making a decision because it was the right decision, not because it was a political calculus,"" said Luria Thursday. 
 
Luria tells CBN News 63% of the phone calls to her office have been supportive of her decision.
 
""Whether it has future implications on my election prospects in 2020, I want to be able to look in the mirror and say that I was on the right side of history and not that this has any political ramifications,"" continued Luria. 
 
In the crowd at Thursday's town hall, support for the impeachment inquiry was mixed.
 
""Trump needs to be impeached,"" Michael Hashemy told CBN News. 
 
""You got to have meat behind whatever you're doing, I don't know that there's enough meat behind it, I don't really care at this point,"" countered Donna Rennick. 
 
While veteran Denise Kline tells CBN News she personally supports the impeachment inquiry, she doesn't think the majority of the district agrees with her. 
 
""When the Ukraine issue really became such a front and center issue, I realized that this was the time that we really had to do something,"" said Kline. ""I have seen three letters to the editor where people are quite upset with this decision that Luria made, and two that have been in support.""
 
Outside the town hall, Republicans held a counter-protest.
 
Virginia Beach Republican Chair Tina Mapes said, ""They're sitting there looking for an opportunity to try and impeach the president instead of looking for an opportunity to work for their constituents."" 
 
""This impeachment inquiry is going nowhere. It's clearly a fraud, and it's another attempt by the Democrats to undo the election of 2016,"" added Jack Wilson, chairman of the Republican Party of VA.
 
Luria is one of about 60 vulnerable Democrats the national Republican Party is targeting with big digital ad buys in 2020 hoping to win back that seat in the House.

But now there are revelations the whistleblower went to a certain congressman before releasing the complaint.
""We don't call him shifty for nothing,"" President Trump said of House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) Wednesday in the Oval Office.
At the heart of the matter is a CIA officer's whistleblower complaint that Trump pressed Ukraine's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son.
Trump maintains that the transcript of the call is an exoneration.
""Here's where I fooled them,"" Trump said referring to Democrats. ""They never thought I'd release the conversation. They never thought in a million years I'd release the conversation.""
Meanwhile, Democrats say this is no joke.
""We're not fooling around here,"" said Schiff in the news conference with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) where they announced they would subpoena the White House.
There are serious questions surrounding Schiff though after it was reported the whistleblower first went to his office. Namely, what did Schiff know about the complaint and its release? And was this a coordinated effort?
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) tweeted, ""This is a carefully orchestrated plot to overthrow the duly elected President of the United States. We need answers, and we need accountability!""
And conservative radio host Bill Mitchell tweeted, ""So Schiff knew all about the whistleblower complaint despite saying he had been kept in the dark. The plot thickens.""

There are more concerns too that the investigation may now be done largely behind closed doors after Pelosi handed over the investigation to the House Intelligence Committee.
""I think the president knows the argument that can be made against him, and he's scared,"" Pelosi told ABC news in an interview that aired Thursday morning.
Former State Department Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volcker will be deposed in a closed hearing Thursday and more White House officials are being pulled into the controversy with revelations Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and an aide to Vice President Mike Pence were on the call.
At the same time, the State Department's Inspector General turned over documents to key House and Senate committees. Democratic leaders say the packet was full of debunked conspiracy theories, but one report says a Ukrainian prosecutor told Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that he was ordered to back off the investigation into Hunter Biden's involvement in that Ukrainian company.
As to the whistleblower, overnight his lawyer pushed back on the suggestion that he worked with Schiff's office to draft the complaint. In a statement the lawyer says the whistleblower wrote it entirely on his own.

However, religious freedom advocates argue the Trump administration is setting a bad example by deciding to accept fewer refugees than ever.
Just hours after the administration announced it would only accept 18,000 refugees this year, CBN News learned about families set to board planes to the US only to have their dreams dashed at the last moment.
Bethany Christian Services was working with some of those families on the verge of relief.
""They gave everything away that they had at the refugee camp - the pots that they cook with, their extra clothes because they weren't going to need it anymore, they were going to be resettled to the United States and reunified with their family. They slept outside the office that was going to bring them to the airport the next day and when the workers arrived, they had to tell them that their flights were canceled,"" says Nate Bult with Bethany Christian Services.  
Although the numbers fluctuate and have fallen drastically since the program began 40 years ago, the US has never taken in such a small number of refugees.
According to the State Department, 80 percent of the world's people live in countries where their religious freedom is threatened. It's a reality experts say translates into a global refugee crisis.
""What we're seeing is people fleeing oppressive countries and needing to resettle in a safe place,"" says NadineMaenza, a commissioner on the US Commission for International Religious Freedom.
She says Americans often confuse the chaos at the southern border with refugees.
""A refugee is somebody who can't go back. The conditions are so bad for them - if they go back it won't be safe for them,"" Maenza tells CBN News.
Advocates say refugees resettled in the US aren't living off US taxpayers. In the long run, they end up paying significantly more in taxes than the cost of assistance.
""When a refugee is resettled to the United States, they have 90 days to not only survive in the United States, but to thrive and provide for their families. After that US government assistance is cut off and they must have jobs and be contributing taxpayers back to the economy,"" Bult tells CBN News.
And while advocates say no White House has been stronger on religious freedom than that of President Trump's, United Nations data shows when the US takes fewer refugees, other countries follow its lead, and that troubles many evangelicals.
""Christ is very clear - especially in his parable about the good Samaritan - about what the obligations of his followers are, and it's to welcome the stranger, to welcome a neighbor,"" Bult says.
Some observers fear the administration's low refugee admissions will cause the dismantling of the US refugee program.
""I've been told by people in the industry that it does dismantle the infrastructure. So, I do think it will be costlier to build back up again if we decide that we're going to accept additional refugees,"" Maenza explains.
In the coming year, religious freedom advocates hope the administration realizes it can address illegal immigration while also extending a hand to refugees desperate for a safe place to live."

Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) tops the list pulling in $25.3 million from about 1.4 million donors. The Vermont senator says he's now collected $61.5 million from 3.3 million individual donors since launching his White House bid in February, making his average contribution $19.
Indianapolis Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised $19.1 million, which is about $5 million less than what he raised in the second quarter.
California Sen. Kamala Harris has raised $11.6 million in the past three months, a sum that leaves her trailing several rivals in the Democratic presidential primary's money race.
Sen. Cory Booker raised more than $6 million over the last three months, with a third of that coming in the past 10 days after he warned he would have to drop out of the Democratic presidential race if he didn't take in more cash by Monday's fundraising deadline.
Republicans reportedly have raised $15 million in the wake of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.  The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign have raised $210 million since the beginning of the year. 
Gabby Orr, White House reporter at Politico and CBN Chief Political Analyst David Brody appeared on Tuesday's edition of CBN News' Faith Nation to discuss the Democrats fundraising efforts. Faith Nation can be seen weeknights on the CBN News Channel."

Employees in Impeachment Inquiry,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is vowing to block efforts by Congress to 'bully' State Department officials into testifying about President Trump's Ukraine phone call.
He accuses House Democrats of trying to 'intimidate' State Department officials, saying the way Congress made the request was as ""an act of intimidation"" which violated constitutional separation of powers.
""They contacted State Department employees directly, told them not to contact legal counsel at the State Department. That's been reported to us. They said that the State Department wouldn't be able to be present,"" he said.
Pompeo is pushing back on efforts to depose former and current State Department officials by committees involved in the impeachment inquiry into his boss President Trump. 
The secretary tweeted that he's ""concerned with aspects"" of requests ""that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly distinguished professionals of the Department of State.""

He also added.

""Let me clear: I will not tolerate such tactics. I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.""
Two of those State Department employees will meet privately with the committee. Kurt Volker, the former envoy to Ukraine, is scheduled to testify Thursday.
It's reported Pompeo listened in on that July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, where Trump asked for help to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. Wednesday Pompeo confirmed that he was in fact on the call.

President Trump was also on the defense Tuesday reiterating that his call with Ukraine was 'perfect,' 'nice and warm'.
The commander-in-chief's personal lawyer also faces scrutiny and a subpoena.
Democrats want Rudy Giuliani to turn over any Ukraine-related documents after he was implicated in the whistleblower complaint 30 times. It's unclear if he'll comply. 
""I don't know. I'm weighing the alternatives,"" Giuliani said. ""I'll kind of go through it. I'll get all my evidence together.  I'll get my shards.""
The president was back on Twitter Tuesday calling the entire ordeal ""just another Democrat hoax!""

However, newly uncovered documents conflict with the story Biden tells about the pressure he put on Ukraine while he was vice president.
On the Democratic side, the agenda is clear. ""If there were any doubt about the need for impeachment proceeding, there's none now,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told reporters on Capitol Hill.
Republicans want to know more about the whistleblower and point out the complaint is only based on secondhand knowledge.
 
""When I think of whistleblower complaints, I generally think of someone with firsthand knowledge of the events in question,"" tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).
As to the other matters in complaint: Clearly a coordinated effort to take second-hand information to create a narrative damaging to the President.
When I think of whistleblower complaints I generally think of someone with first-hand knowledge of the events in question.
— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 26, 2019
During his testimony before Congress, the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire also emphasized the complaint was ""hearsay"" and ""not corroborated by other folks.""
The president expressed a similar sentiment in audio leaked to the Los Angeles Times.
""Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call. He never saw the call,"" the president said during a private event.
Meanwhile, the Ukraine issue again raises questions about Joe Biden's push to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired while he was vice president. 
Biden insists he wanted Viktor Shokin gone because he was corrupt, not because he was investigating Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian company that happened to employ his son Hunter at the time. However, a newly uncovered sworn affidavit tells another story. 
""In that statement, Mister Shokin swears under oath he was told he was fired because he refused to drop the Burisma investigation and it made Mister Biden, the vice president, unhappy,"" The Hill Vice President John Solomon told Sean Hannity on Fox News Thursday.
Heading into an election year, the big question is what do voters think about a push for impeachment?

The US Constitution empowers the House – and the House alone – to impeach high-ranking government officials, while the Senate would convene an impeachment trial. A supermajority of two-thirds of the Senate would be needed to remove any president from office.

Whistleblower Report Released, Trump Team Blasts Democrats for Impeachment 'Hysteria'
'No Quid Pro Quo' in Trump Transcript of Call with Ukraine President: Here's What It Reveals
Breaking Down the Whistleblower Complaint into Bite-Sized Pieces
""The president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""
While treason and bribery seem relatively clear cut, the phrase ""other high crimes and misdemeanors"" is not.
That leads to serious questions about what constitutes an impeachable offense. 
Thomas Jipping, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation explained it for CBN News. ""It is a little bit of an odd phrase, and those words might mean something to people today - they might hear the word misdemeanor and think that it's a minor, little offense. But it's a phrase that's been around in the law both here and in England for a few hundred years actually.""
""It identifies a category, a very narrow category of serious misconduct by a public official. Not necessarily criminal, but in a sense it's an offense against the public trust, it's an offense against the political system, it's kind of a betrayal of the people in such a way that that official ought to be removed now."" 
""In the case of the president, it'd be like saying he's gotta go now instead of waiting for next year's election. So it's a narrow category of very serious offenses,"" Jipping explained.
Impeachment Is a Political Process
The US Supreme Court has declared that impeachment is a political process, not a legal process. Heritage explains it this way:
""The most important point to understand about impeachment is that it is not a legal proceeding like a federal criminal prosecution. And none of the formal procedural or evidentiary rules that apply to both criminal and civil trials in the federal courts are applicable in an impeachment trial.""
In other words, the political party that's in control of the House can determine how it wants to proceed and what it considers to be treason-worthy.
Before receiving the record of the White House phone call, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated she's already made up her mind, saying the president's actions have seriously violated the Constitution. Jipping says that's a surprising conclusion at this stage in the process.
""I was a little bit confused by her press conference because, on the one hand, she's trying to explain why now she supports an impeachment inquiry when before she didn't. And so she's saying we need to investigate, we need to get the facts. And on the other hand she (reaches) an explicit conclusion about the entire matter. She can't have it both ways.""

A new Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows a majority of Americans do not think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office.
According to the poll only 37 percent of those polled believe the president should be impeached and 57 percent of people disagreed.
CBN News hit the streets in Hampton Roads to see what people in this area had to say about Democrats' decision to move forward with the impeachment process.

Whistleblower Report Released, Trump Team Blasts Democrats for Impeachment 'Hysteria'
'No Quid Pro Quo' in Trump Transcript of Call with Ukraine President: Here's What It Reveals
On Wednesday, the White House released an unredacted transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelensky. It reveals Trump encouraged Ukraine's president to work with Attorney General William Barr and Rudy Giuliani to investigate whether Joe Biden had interfered with a Ukrainian investigation of Hunter Biden, his son.
The unnamed whistleblower then accuses the White House of attempting to conceal records of that conversation.
""In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple US officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all the records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the White House situation room.""
The whistleblower goes on to say the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.
The whistleblower even alleges this has happened before, writing:
 
""According to White House officials I spoke with, this was 'not the first time' under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into the codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive – rather than national security sensitive – information.""
President Trump was fired up after the US intel chief fielded questions from lawmakers Thursday on the whistleblower complaint.
""My call was perfect, the president of the Ukraine said yesterday there was no pressure put on him whatsoever, none whatsoever and he said it loud and clear for the press,"" Trump said. ""What these guys are doing, Democrats, are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn't be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts.""
President Trump repeatedly tried to dismiss the significance of the phone call with Ukraine's president saying there was ""no pressure"" on their part. Yes, the President did withhold military aid from Ukraine, but not on that phone call. He insists that move was not an attempt to put pressure on Ukraine's president.

The hearing, which met on the topic of “How The Tax Code Subsidizes Hate,” was held by Democrats hoping to end the tax-exempt law for some organizations they consider hateful, as defined by the controversial Southern Poverty Law Center.
While House Republicans argued that Democrats picking and choosing which groups received tax-exempt status infringes on First Amendment rights, the Democrats contend that Americans deserve to know where their money is going, and claimed if taxpayers were to learn it has been going to these so-called “hate groups,” they will not be happy.
“It’s unacceptable that your money continues to help propagate hatred from groups like these,” the Ways and Means Committee tweeted.

The subcommittee allowed visitors to share personal stories in regards to these hate groups, each asking congress to strip various organizations of their tax-exempt status.
The list includes organizations like the Family Research Council, Federation for American Immigration Reform, American Family Association, and D. James Kennedy Ministries, just to name a few.
Each group is designated as a “hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an organization that has both an anti-Christian background and controversial leadership.
Over the past year, the SPLC leadership has faced intense scrutiny over serious sexual assault allegations, along with racial discrimination in the workplace, as the New Yorker reported.
FAITHWIRE  ‘Nothing More Than a Weapon of the Radical Left’: SPLC Given an ‘F’ by Charity Watch
Amid the allegations, the group’s co-founder Morris Dees was fired and the SPLC President, Richard Cohen, was forced to step down as well.
As previously reported by Faithwire, SPLC has a history of combative behavior towards Christian and conservative groups. In April 2019, a group of Christian and conservative leaders signed a letter asking CEOs of companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon to cut ties with SPLC.
“It is now clear that the SPLC has proven to be a hate-filled, anti-Christian, anti-conservative organization and nothing more than a weapon of the radical left, whose goal is to bully people into compliance with their ideology,” the letter stated. “Fail to comply with their demands, and you will be labeled as a hate group or an extremist.”
The SPLC defines hate groups as those which “have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics,” which appears to include supporting a traditional or Biblical view of marriage, and immigration reform that increases border and national security.
In the past, they have targeted groups like Alliance Defending Freedom, the Family Research Council, and Prager University for conservative and/or Christian ideology.
They’ve done “nothing but demean, smear, and attack its opponents,” says Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, who is individually listed on the SPLC hate-list. “They claim that they’re trying to promote tolerance when they’re completely intolerant of people with an alternative point of view,” he continued, adding that his organization is seeking out an IRS investigation of SPLC’s tax-exempt status.
According to the Center for Immigration Studies last year, the SPLC was reported to have more than half a billion dollars in assets, “putting tens of millions in tax havens.”

The case has convinced more Democrats to join in the calls for impeachment while most Republicans are coming to Trump's defense.
""I found the allegations deeply disturbing, I also found them very credible,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters after he and members of the House Intelligence Committee read the whistleblower complaint Wednesday evening.
Hours earlier, the White House released the transcript of the July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Democrats insist there was quid pro quo or pay to play. Most Republicans though say there's no smoking gun, pointing out that the president never threatened to withhold anything from Ukraine in that phone call.
""To impeach any president over a phone call would be insane,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters.
The transcript shows President Trump asking President Zelensky to ""look into"" Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's actions as vice president that allegedly might have helped his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine. Trump also asks Zelensky to work with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and US Attorney General Bill Barr.
But Zelensky says he wasn't pressured.
""I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,"" Zelensky said sitting next to Trump Wednesday afternoon at the United National General Assembly in New York.
The Justice Department says Trump and the attorney general never spoke about the call and Barr never contacted Ukraine.
""You take a look at that call and it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo,"" said Trump in a speech to the UN.  
Still, for the first time, the majority of the House of Representatives, which is run by the Democrats, now supports an impeachment inquiry.

The Trump administration is trying to de-classify the report so they can hand it to Congress, hoping it will help prove the president's innocence. But how does the whistleblower process actually work?
First, a whistleblower complaint is sent to the Inspector General. In this case, the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) who reviews and investigates the complaint.
The ICIG gives a copy of the complaint and his determination about its credibility to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).
After the whistleblower complaint and the ICIG's report, the DNI has seven days to report it to Congress. 
The Whistleblower Protection Act allows whistleblowers to go directly to Congressional intelligence committees to report an ""urgent concern,"" defined as, among other things, a ""serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of law or Executive order, or deficiency"" but they're obliged to obey directions from the DNI so their complaint remains secure.
In this case, involving President Trump, once the DNI realized the complaint was about the president, he sought guidance from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which advised him the complaint about the president's communications with a foreign leader was covered by executive privilege. Within the executive branch, OLC opinions are considered to be binding.

Trump opponents have accused him of withholding aid to Ukraine in order to force the new Ukrainian president to carry out some investigations, but the phone call does not confirm that accusation.

The transcript shows Trump asking Ukraine to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election, specifically asking if a Democratic server that Russia hacked may have been based in Ukraine.
He also asks the president to consider looking into reports that former Vice President Joe Biden may have stepped in to quash a Ukrainian investigation into Biden's son who was working at a Ukrainian energy company.
Here are a few of the top quotes from President Trump during the phone call, related the Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and Joe Biden's involvement with Ukraine, according to the transcript:
""I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it.

""There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.

Tuesday evening, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called for an official impeachment inquiry saying, ""No one is above the law"" and that ""the actions taken by the president have violated the Constitution."" 
Trump announced Tuesday afternoon that he'll be releasing the full transcript of his phone call with Ukraine's president in an effort to shed more light and less heat on the case.

Dems Drum Up More Impeachment Threats Over Trump's Conversations With Ukrainian Leader
Faith Nation Roundtable: Warren's Rising Poll Numbers, Democrats 'Whistleblower' Case, and Trump Calls Out Religious Persecution at UN
""I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,"" Trump tweeted. ""You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!""

Pelosi had been demanding the administration release the whistleblower report and the private phone conversation between President Trump and the president of Ukraine. Trump's response has been clear, arguing he did nothing wrong.
""It's just a Democrat witch-hunt. Here we go again. They failed with Russia, they failed with everything, and now they're bringing this up,"" Trump told reporters Monday.
A new Washington Post report alleges that Trump ordered aides to freeze millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine days before he spoke with the country's president.
The report cites an administration official who says the freeze was out of concerns of corruption in Ukraine, and Senate Republicans who said Trump was trying to determine if the new president was pro-West or pro-Russia.
Democrats think the president offered to release the aid, only if Ukraine launched a corruption investigation into Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's involvement in a Ukrainian energy company.
""I put no pressure on them. I think it probably, possibly could have been OK if I did, but I didn't put any pressure on them whatsoever,"" Trump said in response to the allegations.
""There's a difference between Donald Trump telling the Ukrainian president, 'Hey you might want to look at Joe Biden.' It's another thing to say, 'You better look at Joe Biden and if not we have a few hundreds of millions of dollars of aid,'"" CBN News Chief Political Analyst David Brody said on Faith Nation.
In an op-ed published in the Washington Post late Monday, seven freshman Democrat lawmakers who served in the military and national security said that if the allegation against Trump is true, it's impeachable. These Democrats hold sway with House leadership because many of them are from Republican-held districts where Trump has been popular, and have so far been against impeachment.
Republicans say they don't have enough information yet and point to the allegations against Joe Biden's actions as Vice President when his son worked with a Ukrainian company that was under scrutiny by a government prosecutor. 
""What's Hunter Biden doing on the board of directors of a major Ukraine natural gas company? And did his dad call off or ask to have the prosecutor call off in a way that would inure to the benefit of his company? I don't know, I just think it all looks bad, all of it,"" Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) said.
Speaker Pelosi set a deadline for Thursday to receive the whistleblower report, promising new investigations if it's not handed over."

The president says it's just more fake news.
Trump admits he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden with the Ukrainian president but denies any wrongdoing.
Democrats say there's only one way to find out; release the transcripts of that phone call.
""The conversation I had was largely congratulatory…was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son adding to the corruption already in the Ukraine,"" said Trump.  
The Trump administration is defending the July 25th conversation in which the Wall Street Journal says Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian president about eight times to investigate political rival Biden.
President Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani accuse the former VP of working to get rid of a Ukrainian prosecutor who reportedly was looking into a company where Biden's son Hunter served as a board member.
""Trump's doing this because he knows I'll beat him like a drum. And he's using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me,"" retorted Biden.  
The president is defending that conversation in a tweet, calling the report a media con job and saying there was no pressure.
Now the Fake News Media says I “pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him.” This supposedly comes from a so-called “whistleblower” who they say doesn’t even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con.....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2019
The Ukrainian foreign minister is also coming to Trump's defense over that phone call.
..Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren’t pressured at all during the “nice” call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son’s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That’s the real story!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2019
The incident coincides with a whistleblower complaint that reportedly involves Trump's phone calls with a foreign leader.
An inspector general for the Director of National Intelligence called that complaint ""urgent"" but Democrats have not been able to obtain the complaint from the administration. They want to see if the two incidents are connected.
Democrats accuse the president of offering a quid pro quo to the Ukrainians and that impeachment may be the only solution.
""If the president is trying to withhold foreign aid at the same time he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit…then that may be the only remedy,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told CNN.  
That same Wall Street Journal story says there was no mention of money or a quid pro quo and administration officials say it's unlikely.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has always been lukewarm on that idea of impeachment but she is giving the administration until Thursday to turn over that whistleblower complaint or face more investigations."

The goal is to get Christians across America more engaged in the political process – 90 million Christians in America are eligible to vote, but as many as 40 million fail to vote in Presidential election cycles. And 15 million are not even registered to vote, according to the My Faith Votes website.  
Jason Yates, CEO of My Faith Votes, appeared on Thursday's edition of CBN News' Faith Nation to talk about the event.
Some people say churches should stay out of politics, but Yates says Christians should be involved in the political process.
""Our honorary national chairman is Mike Huckabee and I asked him that same question recently and what he said to me was, 'Do you do your dishes? Because if you don't do your dishes and you just turn your back on it the stack of dishes is only going to grow and the stench from all your dirty dishes is only going to grow, so what you've gotta do is roll up your sleeves and do the dishes.' And I think that's a perfect analogy for what we're doing here,"" Yates explains. ""We can't just ignore it. We have to bring the good of our faith, the values of our faith into the election process, into the civic square.""

The White House says 47 percent of America's homeless population is located in the Golden State alone. 
One issue according to the administration is a lack of affordable housing in the state.
Although it's unclear how the government would fix the issue, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson says all options are on the table.  He's calling on all levels of government to work together with advocates, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and advocacy groups.
On Monday, the same day President Trump visited Los Angeles, Carson got a first-hand look at LA's Skid Row. The latest count showed the homeless population rising to more than 36,000 and they're not only located downtown but throughout various parts of the city.
""Well, you know, I am a Christian,"" Carson told the assembled media. ""I believe in the Bible and there are a lot of verses in the Bible about our obligation to the poor.  And that coupled with my own experience and recognizing that there is a pathway out.""
One option floated by Carson is using vacant federal buildings in California as homeless shelters. 
""It's a severe crisis in L.A. and in many parts of California because it's not just a fact that people are out on the street, but you know there's feces on the street, there are all kinds of health hazards there. And this could really blow up into a major epidemic. So we need to do something,"" said Carson on Fox News @ Night Tuesday. 
Carson told the network the president wants to investigate a range of options, including policing and mental health.
""We must understand that as a nation we have failed a lot of the mentally incapable people by just throwing them out and not supporting them,"" Carson continued. ""Some people think that that's compassion. But that's not compassion at all. We have to really begin to work with the American Psychiatric Association and some others in terms of what kinds of programs are going to work for these individuals,"" he said.
Returning from California on Tuesday, President Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One about California's problem with homelessness.
""We can't let Los Angeles, San Francisco, and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what's happening,"" he said. "

Right now, he's got a different mission to fulfill.
If he ever does run, Lindell would follow in the foosteps of other non-politicians in his home state of Minnesota. Former pro-wrestler Jesse Ventura was governor and comedian Al Franken of Saturday Night Live fame served as US senator.  
""We're a mess in Minnesota,"" Lindell said jokingly.

‘I Was an...Addict’: Inside My Pillow Inventor Mike Lindell’s Amazing Transformation
From Crack Addict to CEO
Appearing on the CBN News Channel program The Global Lane, Lindell said a lot of people have asked if he would consider entering politics.
""If God had me run for something, I would do it in a heartbeat. But right now I want to keep backing the greatest president we have ever had in history,"" he insisted.
Lindell has come under fire for supporting Donald Trump. Leftwing groups like Moveon.org have launched on-line petition boycotts of My Pillow for supporting what they say are the ""racist, sexist and homophobic policies "" of President Trump.
Global Lane host Gary Lane said some people wonder how Lindell could say such a thing about Trump. ""Some Americans would say you're still smoking crack - the best president in the history of America?""
""I can say that because when I came out of crack addiction I had never voted. I didn't know a liberal from a conservative. I had a clean slate. It's like a child growing into something going, 'where are all our values and what's going on,'"" Lindell explained. ""When I came out of addiction I saw our country, a president giving away money to evil empires (Iran), I heard of a thing called ISIS, all my friends were unemployed. I was going, 'What happened here?'""
Lindell first met Donald Trump when he ran for president in 2016. He says when he talked to Trump's employees, they spoke fondly of their boss.
""Every one of them was like talking to one of my employees. They all had something very good to say about him, that he's an amazing guy, he's an amazing boss and he's so smart,"" Lindell recalled. ""I'm reading him and I'm going, 'wow, this guy has absolutely no agenda other than to help our country and he genuinely cares about individuals.'""
Lindell says it's all about results, arguing that Trump has improved the lives of Americans.
He wants to help the president remain in office so he may continue helping the country. He intends to campaign for Trump in as many Minnesota cities as he can in hopes of turning the ""Star of the North"" state red. In 2016, Trump lost Lindell's home state by only 44,600 votes.  
""I've always said everybody loves our president - some just don't know it yet...if you shut off the news I tell them look around you, are you better off? And they all say yes.""    
Lindell says he will donate proceeds from his soon to be released book, What are the Odds: From Crack Addict to CEO to help drug addicts overcome their addictions.
In the meantime, he urges people suffering from addiction to seek a faith-based treatment center and to seek out former addicts who have overcome their addictions. Lindell says it's important to give people common hope. His hope comes from faith in God.
""I have listened to God for what I am supposed to do and we just keep getting rewarded and rewarded.""
My Pillow started with only five employees in 2004. Today, the company employs 1,500 workers and has sold more than 40-million pillows.
 
The ""My Pillow Guy"" says he'll keep sharing his success story with people in Minnesota and around the world.
""My story gives people hope, but maybe not a 22-year-old opiate addict, but I might give a lot of 58-year-old crack addicts hope. People say to me, 'Mike, what's your best day ever in My Pillow?' The day we're sitting in.""

He will be hosting and speaking at the Global Call to Protect Religious Freedom event next Monday. Vice President Mike Pence will also be there. 
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham says, ""The President will call on the international community to take concrete steps to prevent attacks against people on the basis of their religion or beliefs and to ensure the sanctity of houses of worship and all public spaces for all faiths.""
Since he became president, Trump has held multiple events where he has personally highlighted the plight of religious persecution victims. Just a few months ago, he spent over an hour listening to stories from survivors in the Oval Office. 
""Each of you has suffered tremendously for your faith,"" the president said to them back in July. ""You've endured harassment, threats, attacks, trials, imprisonment, and torture.  I got to know many of you and helped you get some — get some of you out of the difficult situation that you were in.  I'm very proud of you in the way you've reacted to a different life.  It is a tremendous thing.""
President Trump has made protecting religious freedom a major priority in his administration. He said he would do so during the 2016 presidential campaign and has taken plenty of steps to make good on that promise. One of his Executive Orders relaxes IRS enforcement on churches that engage in political speech and activities. 
In addition, for the last two years, the State Department hosted the groundbreaking Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom that brought in religious leaders around the world in an attempt to look for ways to combat religious persecution and discrimination around the world.
President Trump has also focused heavily on religious freedom during the National Day of Prayer events at the White House.  Rose Garden ceremonies have been filled with individuals and groups who have been targeted in lawsuits for standing up for their faith. Some have been targets of violence because of their faith. This past May, he brought Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein up to the presidential podium. He was one of the victims of a weekend gun rampage at a synagogue in Poway, California. After his remarks, Trump made him a promise. 
""We will fight with all of our strength and everything that we have in our bodies to defeat anti-Semitism, to end the attacks on the Jewish people, and to conquer all forms of persecution, intolerance, and hate…Every citizen has the absolute right to live according to the teachings of their faith and the convictions of their heart,"" the president said. ""This is the bedrock of American life."""

She appeared on Tuesday's edition of CBN News' Faith Nation to discuss the latest allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
There's a new call to impeach Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass) introduced a House resolution on Tuesday to bring an inquiry on the issue.  
It comes in the wake of new allegations of sexual misconduct from Kavanaugh's college days – allegations the alleged victim doesn't even recall.

Critics Say NY Times Built a Fake New Kavanaugh Bombshell by Omitting Key Details
It all began over the weekend after the New York Times published new allegations of sexual assault against him.
But now, the Times has seriously revised its original report. Their original story left out a major fact – that the supposed victim doesn't confirm the accusation against Kavanaugh.
According to a new book by a pair of Times reporters, a Yale classmate by the name of Max Stier – who worked to defend President Clinton during legal battles in the 1990s – approached the FBI during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to say he witnessed Kavanaugh sexually assault a fellow classmate. But the problem is – Stier has never spoken publicly about the allegation or tried to contact the Senate Judiciary Committee with his allegation.
According to Commentary Magazine, Sen. Chuck Grassley's (R-Iowa) office ""has no record of Stier reaching out with his allegation.""
Stier's NY Times accusation is similar to another made by Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that was brought up during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.
Grassley tweeted, ""despite 7 attempts by staff, Ms. Ramirez' lawyers declined to provide documentary evidence referenced in the article/witness accounts to support the claims. They also declined invitations for Ms. Ramirez to speak with committee investigators or to provide a written statement.""
""The committee's review found no verifiable evidence to support the claims. The @nytimes' own reporting at the time noted that it couldn't find anyone with firsthand knowledge & that Ms. Ramirez told friends she couldn't be sure Kavanaugh was involved:
.@NYTimes did not contacted Sen. Grassley’s office for this story. If they had, we would've reminded them of a few key public facts they omitted:
1. @senjudiciary staff proactively contacted Ms. Ramirez' lawyers soon after the New Yorker story broke.https://t.co/c8dHQZf4T2

3. Nonetheless, our investigators spoke to and reviewed material from several Yale classmates of Ms. Ramirez and Justice Kavanaugh in order to assess the claim. You can read the committee’s 414-page investigative summary here:https://t.co/R8nGxzdROJ

— Sen. Grassley Press (@GrassleyPress) September 15, 2019
Throughout the course of that emotional Fall 2018 process, Kavanaugh was accused of assault by three women, accusations he vehemently denied.
""I have never sexually assaulted anyone. Not in high school, not in college, not ever,"" Kavanaugh testified last year.
Ramirez was contacted by the FBI but according to the Times' original report, this alleged victim was not. That prompted some Democrats to demand impeachment.  
But it turns out the Times report that prompted all that Democrat outrage wasn't entirely truthful. Now, in a revised version of that report, the Times says the alleged victim declined an interview and friends say she does not recall the incident at all.  
A Hit Job That Omitted Key Facts
Perhaps the final nail in the coffin of Democrats impeachment calls against Kavanaugh will be driven home by NPR's Hanna Rosin, who notes in her review of Pogrebin's and Kelly's book: 
""In the end, they turn up no smoking gun, no secret confession, no friend who comes forth to say Kavanaugh was lying all this time."" 
Ironically, it will appear in next Sunday's New York Times Book Review.
The National Review's John McCormack writes, ""Omitting this fact from the New York Times story is one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory.""
""I think this is the New York Times being bitter-enders,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) told ABC's ""This Week."" ""At some point, they just have to let the anger go and recognize that the democratic process actually moves on.""
President Trump asked if the Times had a fact-checker in place. 
""I think The New York Times made another terrible mistake. It's a shame that a thing like that could happen — I see that they're making a big correction today,"" Trump said. ""They just announced there's a correction, but to do that about a Supreme Court justice is a terrible thing. It's a false accusation. Whatever happened with The New York Times, I mean, I can tell you personally that they never check … they used to have a thing called fact-checking — they don't do fact-checking anymore.""
The president previously suggested the newspaper should be sued for libel over the accusation.
Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Senate majority leader, said this is more than just the left's obsession with one man.
""On the basis of this flimsy uncorroborated story, they're calling for Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh to be impeached,"" McConnell said. ""It would be a mistake to dismiss this as a bad case of sour grapes. This is not just a left-wing obsession with one man. It's part of a deliberate effort to attack judicial independence.""
Carrie Severino is the chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network. She co-wrote the book Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court about the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh. She told CBN News' Faith Nation on Tuesday this is just more out of the same playbook that we saw last year.
""We want people to understand. This is not just coming out of the blue,"" Severino explained. ""We knew there would be another attempt to smear a Supreme Court nominee or justice. We just didn't know it would be Justice Kavanaugh again. We thought maybe the next nominee.""
""I think ultimately it's an attempt to threaten and intimidate the justice because they're worried he's going to make decisions they don't agree with,"" she added.
Even the country's comedians were getting a word in about the Times journalistic faux pas. Argus Hamilton, the host comedian at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles, CA, quipped on social media, ""The NY Times should be warned that the Whopper is trademarked by Burger King."""

Rep. Jackie Walorski, who represents South Bend, Indiana where the abortionist had his Women's Pavilion clinic, was first to demand a federal investigation when the news of the discovery broke Saturday morning. In a statement released to the press, Walorski said, ""There could be Indiana aborted babies in those jars in this guy's house...This is sick.""
But another prominent politician in the area has thus far – at this writing – had nothing to say about the grisly revelations at the abortionist's home. According to Real Clear Politics (RCP), Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg, has been silent on the grisly discovery, and RCP has no luck getting a response from him despite repeated attempts.

Buttigieg is a strong supporter of abortion rights, even up to the birth date of the baby. He appeared to justify late-term abortion recently saying that life begins ""at breath."" 
He was the mayor of South Bend for about five years while Klopfer's Women's Pavilion Clinic did business there. The clinic closed in 2016 under state investigation, and Klopfer had his medical license suspended that year as well for several violations including not notifying authorities properly, not giving pain medication to all women, except those under age 16 and those who could pay more, and not having qualified staff to monitor those he did sedate. 
Another abortion clinic called Whole Women's Health sprang up to replace it, employing some of the same staff that had been employed at Klopfer's Women's Pavilion, prompting one doctor to say the new clinic had the ""same kind of profile as Dr. Klopfer's.""
Congressman Jim Banks of Fort Wayne, in a series of tweets, blasted Mayor Pete for his support of the local abortion industry, and targeted his veto of a zoning measure in 2018 that would have allowed Women's Care Center, a pro-life pregnancy center, to locate next door to the Women's Health abortion clinic. 
According to tweets reported by the Daily Caller, Banks said by his veto Buttigieg  ""opposed options"" that would have ""provided an alternative to the direct descendant (Whole Women's Health) of Ulrich Klopfer's house of horrors.""
It must be noted Pete Buttigieg opposed options for women in South Bend that could’ve provided an alternative to the direct descendant to Ulrich Klopfer’s house of horrors.
— Jim Banks (@RepJimBanks) September 15, 2019
""To this day,"" Banks tweeted, ""Mayor Pete seems proud he supported Whole Women's Health with ""the same kind of profile as Dr. Klopfer's."" His national press secretary recently touted it in an interview with the Chicago Tribune.""
He went on to say ""This is especially troubling now that we've learned what kind of monster Dr. Klopfer really was.""
Banks told the Daily Caller, ""I support a federal investigation into Dr. Klopfer's crimes. We need to determine how Dr. Klopfer was able to get away with this for so long, and how we only know about it now that Dr. Klopfer is deceased."" 
The horrific discovery in Klopfer's home makes the Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains signed by Governor Mike Pence in 2016 seem amazingly prescient. But if all that's come to light means more government regulation and increased scrutiny of abortion clinics, Mayor Pete opposes it. At least he has in the past.
""The mayor is deeply concerned by what he views as a new and extreme assault on Roe v. Wade in legislatures across the country,"" Buttigieg spokesman Chris Meagher told the Chicago Tribune in August and reported by Real Clear Politics. ""He believes that the truly radical idea in this debate and around abortion care is one of banning abortion outright.""
The question to Mayor Buttigieg and other abortion supporters now is – without that increased scrutiny, how can another Klopfer be prevented? "

The hearings will focus on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, which Lewandowski helped to run.
The Judiciary panel accepted rules for impeachment hearings last week. This allows witnesses to be questioned at those hearings and gives the committee access to documents in executive sessions.
The Republican Senate is certain to defeat any House efforts to bring charges against Trump if Democrats should proceed with an official impeachment effort. 
CBN News previously reported that the Justice Department released a partially redacted version of the report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It says right off the top, ""The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion,"" but the Trump campaign wasn't part of that effort.
The report clearly states, ""The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" 
Trump insists his team cooperated fully with the investigation which found no evidence of collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. 
Two other White House aides were subpoenaed, along with Lewandowski, but they won't appear before the committee on orders from the administration.
Mueller testified before Congress this summer where Democrats focused mainly on obstruction of justice and Republicans highlighted a variety of issues on Mueller's investigation, including how it got started and if there was bias against Trump in the early days of the investigation.
Still, Democrats hope the hearings will weaken President Trump's re-election prospects, which is something that Mueller's book-length report did not seem to do."

But now, the Times has seriously revised its original report. Their original story left out a major fact – that the alleged victim doesn't confirm the accusation against Kavanaugh.
According to a new book by a pair of Times reporters, a Yale classmate by the name of Max Stier – who worked to defend President Clinton during legal battles in the 1990s – approached the FBI during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to say he witnessed Kavanaugh sexually assault a fellow classmate.

That accusation is similar to another made by Yale classmate Deborah Ramirez that was brought up during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation.
Throughout the course of that emotional 2018 process, Kavanaugh was accused of assault by three women, accusations he vehemently denied.
""I have never sexually assaulted anyone. Not in high school, not in college, not ever,"" Kavanaugh testified last year.
Ramirez was contacted by the FBI but according to the Times' original report, this alleged victim was not. That prompted some Democrats to demand impeachment.  
""It's more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath. He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter,"" tweeted presidential candidate Julian Castro.
Fellow candidates Senators Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris followed suit in their calls for impeachment.  
""I strongly opposed him based on his views on executive power which will continue to haunt our country as well as how he behaved including the allegation that we are hearing more about today,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) told ABC This Week.  
Former Vice President Joe Biden stopped short of an impeachment call stating, ""We need to get to the bottom of whether the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans pressured the FBI to ignore evidence or prevented them from following up on leads relating to Justice Kavanaugh's background investigation.""
But it turns out the New York Times report that prompted all that Democrat outrage wasn't entirely truthful. Now, in a revised version of that report, the Times says the alleged victim declined an interview and friends say she does not recall the incident at all.  
The National Review's John McCormack writes, ""Omitting this fact from the New York Times story is one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent memory.""
""I think this is the New York Times being bitter-enders,"" accused Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).  
President Trump is also defending his nominee, tweeting Justice Kavanaugh should sue for libel."

Wedged in between the two most liberal candidates, Senators Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MASS), front runner Joe Biden case himself as a practical progressive painting Medicare for all as out of touch.
""This is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Well, let's have a big idea. The tax of 2% the senator is talking about - that raises about $3 billion dollars. Guess what. that leaves you about $28 billion dollars short. The senator said before it's going to cost you. There will be a deductible in your paycheck,"" argued former Vice President Joe Biden.
""Let us be clear Joe. In the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as the Canadians or any other major country on earth,"" said Sanders waving his hands in his signature way.
""This is America,"" quipped Biden.
""Yeah but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries,"" responded Sanders.
And while Biden tossed a few arrows he took twice as many. The sharpest came from former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro.
""He wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions,"" said Castro.
""I stand with Barack Obama all eight years good, bad and indifferent,"" Biden responded.
Castro struck another blow still reverberating among Democrats when he played into speculation about Biden's mental acuity. It came as Castro worked to differentiate his health care plan from Biden's.
""My plan would do that. Your plan would not,"" Castro said.
""They do not have to buy-in. They do not have to buy-in,"" Biden responded. 
""You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in. You said they would have to buy in. Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?  Are you forgetting what you just said two minutes ago?"" Castro said to boos as Biden tried to figure out what Castro had said.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) made a name for herself by going after Biden in the first debate, but this time she kept her focus on the president.
""Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in the Wizard of Oz. You know, when you pull back the curtain it's a really small dude,"" she said with a smile as the audience laughed.
During a passionate moment on gun violence, Beto O'Rourke gave the NRA ample ammunition to fire up its base.
""Yes. We're gonna take your AR-15's, your AK-47's. We're not gonna allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore,"" said O'Rourke to applause.
The big question candidates are asking today: will any of their performances move the needle in the polls?

The number of congressional Democrats calling for impeachment is growing.
The House Judiciary Committee started the day with a fiery hearing that ended with a party-line vote to approve a resolution that broadens the committee's investigative powers and could eventually lead to an impeachment inquiry.  But Republicans argue the move is misleading.
""At least acknowledge there's a reason why these are not formal impeachment inquiries,"" said Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA)
""Let's change the rules in the middle of the game because we've got to find something,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). ""We got to get this. We've got to find something."" 
""You want to give the allusion of impeachment without the reality of it,"" argued Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) ""You're duping that portion of your base that is clamoring for impeachment into thinking you are when you aren't.""
Thursday's resolution allows Chairman Jerry Nadler to decide if his committee hearings are part of any impeachment probe. It also allows witnesses to be questioned at those hearings and gives the committee access to documents in executive sessions, as well as giving the President due process. 
CBN News spoke with Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) who sits on the Judiciary Committee and argues Democrats are bending the rules with this resolution to try and impeach the president.
""This is wrong on so many levels,"" Biggs told CBN News. ""Let me give you a couple - number one, this is something they've wanted to do but again they're not doing it in the normal process. Normally you'd take this to the floor. You'd get your resolutions passed, they didn't. They had only one-third of their body even support it.""
""The impeachment tool was meant to really solve a real problem if you need to get someone out of office,"" he explained.  ""OK, that's fair but in this instance, two-thirds of Americans say we don't want impeachment, we want to move on, and let's get it going. So it's wrong on multiple levels.""
This week, Biggs was also named as the new chairman of the influential and conservative House Freedom Caucus. 
""I think what we want to go to now is that we want to make sure that we can work within our party to try and continue to make them more conservative and help them remember the promises we made,"" he told CBN News. 
Biggs will step into the chairman's seat on Oct. 2. "

Conservative Republican Dan Bishop won the race for an open congressional seat defeating Democratic candidate Dan McCready.
Bishop is a state senator and he tied himself tightly to President Trump who staged an election eve rally for him Monday night.
""Tonight the voters of North Carolina sent a message that shouldn't just be heard within the confines of the ninth district. It should reverberate across this country and in the halls of the Capitol. The voters said no to the radical liberal policies being pushed by today's Democratic Party,"" Bishop declared.

Some political analysts considered the race to be a referendum on President Trump as well as the upcoming 2020 congressional election.
While Bishop did win with Trump's support, it was a somewhat narrow victory in a historically strong Republican district, so pundits are saying it could be a sign the president faces a tough race in 2020.
The special election had to be held as a do-over after the 2018 congressional election result in that North Carolina district was rejected due to ballot fraud. Bishop was not involved in that 2018 race."

Watch Faith Nation weeknights on the CBN News Channel. Check local listings. 
President Trump announced Tuesday morning that he has asked his National Security Adviser John Bolton to resign.
He tweeted: ""I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore... I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week.""

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019
The president wasn't clear about what topics he specifically disagreed with Bolton about, but the move comes shortly after Trump canceled a peace summit with the Taliban at Camp David.
Trump said that he had ""disagreed strongly"" with many of Bolton's suggestions as a national security adviser, ""as did others in the administration.""
Some of those suggestions, according to Washington insiders, were over the handling of Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. 
One Republican familiar with the disagreements between Trump and Bolton told The Associated Press the adviser's opposition to a possible meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was a precipitating factor in the dismissal. French President Emmanuel Macron has been trying to broker such a meeting, possibly on the sidelines of the upcoming UN General Assembly, in the hope of salvaging the international Iran nuclear deal that Trump withdrew from.
Meanwhile, Trump just dropped plans for Taliban peace talks, citing the terrorist group's most recent bombing which killed a US service member, saying the Taliban can't kill Americans and expect a peace deal with the US. 
The White House had faced heavy criticism for even inviting the Taliban to Camp David, and Bolton reportedly was among those who disagreed with the idea of inviting the Islamic terrorist group to attend.
Bolton replied to the news of his removal with a tweet of his own, saying, ""I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow'.""

Bolton has reportedly texted multiple members of the media since Trump's tweet to insist that he resigned, disagreeing with the way the president is characterizing the encounter. 
Shortly before the news broke, Bolton had also tweeted about 9/11 saying: ""As we reflect this week on the horrific 9/11 attack, it's important to remember how far we've come in combatting radical Islamist terrorist groups but also how much work is left. We stand strong against regimes that sponsor terror & encourage violence against the US & our allies.""

— John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019
Since joining the administration in the spring of last year, Bolton had been skeptical about the president's whirlwind reconciliation with North Korea and has advocated against Trump's decision last year to pull US troops out of Syria. He had tried to persuade Trump to keep US forces in Syria to counter the remnants of the Islamic State and Iranian influence in the region.
Bolton was also opposed to Trump's now-scrapped notion to bring Taliban negotiators to Camp David last weekend to try to finalize a peace deal in Afghanistan.
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, and a former Reagan administration official and defense contracting executive would fill Bolton's role on an acting basis. 
Bolton was named Trump's third national security adviser in March 2018 after the departure of Army Gen. H.R. McMaster.
Trump says he will pick a new security advisor next week."

But the president came out swinging during a visit to the state Monday night criticizing Democrats on everything from immigration to abortion.
Trump knows North Carolina is an important state to win if he is to be re-elected and so he traveled to Fayetteville in a last ditch effort to rally the troops.

North Carolina Special Election Tuesday to Test Trump's Clout Among Voters and GOP
Bernie Sanders Wants to Use Abortion in Poor Countries to Battle Climate Change
Virginia's Democrat Governor Accused of Supporting 'Infanticide', Would Let Babies Die Right After They're Born
It was his first Keep America Great rally in nearly a month. He urged North Carolina voters to reject what he called the failed ideas of the Democrats and elect Dan Bishop in the 9th district special election.
   
""Dan Bishop will fight with everything he has,"" the president said.
The Republican Bishop is in a tight race with Democratic challenger Dan McCready. One poll shows McCready leading Bishop by four points. The district has voted Republican since 1963, and the president appeared in North Carolina to help keep it that way.
""Tomorrow we take the first steps to firing Speaker Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020,"" Trump insisted.
The president delivered a pro-America speech, detailing his accomplishments since taking over the White House in January 2017.
On immigration, he attacked Democratic policies, saying sanctuary cities and the harboring of illegal immigrant criminals is ""disloyalty to American citizens.""
""By the way, we're building that wall and it's going up very big,"" he said.
The crowd cheered and chanted, ""Build the wall, build the wall!""
The president took some time to emphasize his position on abortion saying that ""virtually every top Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb right up to the moment of birth. ""
And Trump mentioned Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's comments about allowing a woman and her doctor to decide if a baby should live moments after birth. Trump called it an execution.
""This is a radical Democrat idea and that's why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortions because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God,"" Trump said.
The president also talked about healthcare and promised to enact a plan that would protect patient choices. ""We're going to end up with a better plan, you watch, we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. You have my word.""
And he gave one last reminder to voters of what is at stake, not only in North Carolina's ninth congressional district, but also nationwide.
""The radical Democrats want to dismantle, demolish and destroy everything that you've gained and they will do it and it won't take that long,"" he warned.

“Even that is something that we can interpret differently,” he added. “No matter what you think about the cosmic question of how life begins, most Americans can get on board with the idea of, ‘I might draw the line here. You might draw the line there.’ The most important thing is the person who should be drawing the line is the woman making the decision.”
Conservative blogger Matt Walsh countered Buttigieg’s argument with this:
A theological question for Buttigieg: when did the Incarnation begin? The Bible says Christ was conceived miraculously in Mary's womb. Was Christ not a human in utero? Was there a time during Christ's Earthly existence when He was subhuman? Explain that one, Mayor.
— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) September 9, 2019
A very good question to ponder, indeed.
In addition to the logical argument, science is increasingly demonstrating the contradiction to Buttigieg’s assertions. The heartbeat, a working mind, nerves, feelings and senses are just some of the things scientists are pointing to earlier and earlier with each technological advancement.
“Fertilization is a critical landmark,” wrote Dr. Fabiola Müller. and Professor O’Rahilly in the Textbook, “Human Embryology & Teratology.” “Because, under ordinary circumstances, a new, genetically distinct human organism is thereby formed.”
As for the Biblical grounding, there are a whole host of scriptures that plainly demonstrate the value God places on the unborn as little lives to be protected at all costs.
Here, Faithwire reels off some 79 Bible verses in which God specifically mentions or references the life of the unborn. A few examples are as follows:
Psalm 127:3 — “Behold, children are a gift of the Lord,
The fruit of the womb is a reward.”
Ecclesiastes 11:5 — “Just as you do not know the path of the wind and how bones are formed in the womb of the pregnant woman, so you do not know the activity of God who makes all things.”
Luke 1:44 — “For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.”

While it remains unclear what Buttigieg, an avowed believer, thinks of verses like these, his hot-topic strategy continues to be an unusual one for most who subscribe to far-left political policies — claiming far-left policies align with Biblical principles."

Congress also faces only three weeks to strike a deal on government funding before a possible government shutdown. The House and Senate are taking different paths to try and avoid a shutdown.
While the Senate plans to work on passing appropriations bills, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer wrote to his colleagues that he's ""disappointed that the Senate failed to introduce a single appropriations bill for the first time in more than three decades"" concluding that ""a continuing resolution will be necessary to prevent another government shutdown.""

Two issues that could complicate the budget deals: border wall funding and gun control.
""I think what the president is doing is the right thing to do, but I think if you take away that congressional ability to decide how money is spent, you really take away the biggest tool that Congress has in the unique balance of power our Constitution creates,"" Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) told NBC's Meet the Press.
After 53 people died from mass shootings in the US in August alone, Democrats are returning to Washington with a priority on gun control.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said, ""Enough is enough. Congress is returning to session, and our first order of business in the Senate should be to pass the House-passed bipartisan background checks act.""
Democrats on the 2020 campaign trail are echoing that call, with candidates uniting for a video calling for gun control legislation.
""Gun violence is literally life and death, it has become so numbingly common that we have kids going to school wondering if they're going to be physically safe,"" say candidates Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg in a combined campaign ad.
And with the growing deficit and debt still not under control, Trump now has another 2020 challenger from his own party – former South Carolina Governor and Congressman Mark Sanford.
""We're headed toward the most predictable financial crisis in the history of our country and we've never been as financially vulnerable, save for the start of our republic, the Civil War and World War Two. I can't sit on the sidelines and not speak up and all of us should find a way to make our voices heard,"" said Sanford in his campaign announcement.

Tuesday's do-over is the last congressional race of 2018. North Carolina's 9th District has been held by the GOP since 1963. In 2016, Trump won the district by 11 percentage points.
Now, after illegal ballot tampering canceled last November's election results, Democrats supporting Dan McCready think they have a chance to storm the stronghold in a run against Republican Dan Bishop.
At a rally in Fayetteville, NC, Trump warned, ""The radical Democrats want to dismantle and demolish and destroy everything that you've gained and they will do it and it won't take long.""
Some political analysts think the President's make or break endorsement in the state could be a test of his own chances in 2020. 
""This will tell us if Trump can carry candidates through suburban districts or not,"" said Sarah Chamberlain, president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which represents moderate Republicans. If not, she said, the GOP must ""work harder to address the concerns of suburban individuals, mainly women.""
Before leaving Washington, Trump dismissed questions of whether a poor result for the Republican candidate would serve as a warning sign in next year's elections.
""No, I don't see it as a bellwether,"" Trump said.
Marshville residents Philip and Diane Ezzell, both 70, were near the front of the line waiting to enter the Trump rally. Both attributed their support for Bishop to his backing by Trump. ""We like his values, and he supports Trump,"" Diane Ezzell said. ""And we don't want no socialist clowns.""
That was a reference to a TV spot by Bishop superimposing the faces of McCready and other prominent Democrats on swaying clown figures.

Senate 'Goes Nuclear' - What It Means for Trump's Court Pick
Neil Gorsuch Confirmed: Will He Be Scalia or Souter?
Gorsuch, 52, was nominated by President Trump and confirmed to the Supreme Court in 2017.
He revealed more of his judicial ideology in a recent interview with the Associated Press.
""It's one thing to think that judges occasionally, mistakenly, wrongly decide cases based on who they like and who they dislike as parties. It's another thing to think that judges are just politicians who are supposed to do that,"" Gorsuch explained.
He mentioned that judges are not politicians, even if their decision in a case is predicable - on account of the president who appointed them.
He would not answer questions about President Trump. ""If you're asking me about politics, I'm not going to touch that,"" Gorsuch said.
All he would say regarding the president was that during the 2017 nomination process, Trump ""was very gracious to my family.""
Gorsuch addressed the 'living Constitution' and clarified that having a dynamic meaning or a sense that the Constitution changes with time is illogical.
""You know, the living Constitution is going to take your rights away and it's going to add ones that aren't there - we have a written Constitution. It's about honoring the words the people chose to adopt. What are the first three words of the Constitution? It's 'We the people,' not 'We the states,' not 'We the nine old judges,'"" he added.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), one of the leading candidates for the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential nomination, sparked outrage for linking abortion to population control during a CNN town hall event in Vermont Wednesday night.
During a discussion on climate change, Sanders said he would support taxpayer-funded programs to provide abortions and birth control for women in developing countries as a measure to combat the climate crisis.
""Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain this growth. I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it's crucial to face,"" a member of the audience asked the Vermont senator. ""Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?""

""The answer is yes,"" Sanders replied. ""And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and make reproductive decisions.""
""And the Mexico City agreement, which denies American aid to those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved in birth control to me is totally absurd,"" he continued. "" So I think especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, is something I very, very strongly support.""
Pro-life supporters have called Sander's response ""horrifying."" 
Constitutional law attorney Jenna Ellis told CBN's Newswatch program she agrees with other conservatives and finds Sanders comments ""absolutely horrifying.""
""This is something where the Democrats are prioritizing a political interest literally over the lives of millions of children,"" she said. ""And to think that Bernie Sanders and the Democrats could be so callous toward human life and especially in other countries that to say that simply because of climate change that we need to promote abortion and encourage young mothers to literally murder their children.  
""If this doesn't show the American people how far progressive-left the Democratic Party has gone, I don't know what will,"" Ellis added. 
""Our government has no plausible constitutional legal or moral argument to be promoting or paying for abortions in other countries,"" she noted. 
CNN host S.E. Cupp said Sanders was talking about eugenics when he made those comments. Eugenics is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as ""the practice or advocacy of controlled selective breeding of human populations (as by sterilization) to improve the population's genetic composition.""
""Let's just state for the record: talking about needing 'population control' through ABORTION for the sake of CLIMATE is talking about EUGENICS,"" Cupp tweeted. ""The fact that @BernieSanders is willing to entertain this vile idea is not only disgusting, it should be disqualifying.""

The hearings broke civil norms with senators frequently interrupting and stepping on each other verbally and a litany of outbursts from protesters. At one point, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) described the process as the ""Twilight Zone,"" referring to the popular TV series that featured a blend of fantasy, science fiction, and horror.
Carrie Severino, an attorney for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, worked with other like-minded groups to support Kavanaugh's nomination.
Her familiarity with what happened behind-the-scenes and some of the key players is the subject of her new book, Justice on Trial, co-authored by Molly Hemingway.
It includes firsthand accounts from sources in the White House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court, describing how the confirmation fight was less about Kavanaugh than the potential ideological shift in the balance of the court.
That, according to Severino, brought out a well-coordinated effort between special interest groups, public relations firms, and the media.
 
""So all of those went together went to produce, really, the worst confirmation process we've seen in American history,"" Severino told CBN News.
At the White House nomination announcement, President Donald Trump had called for a swift, bipartisan vote. However, the hearings moved slowly with a series of delays that eventually led to sordid allegations of alcohol abuse, assault, and gang rape against Trump's second high court nominee.
As heartrending as it was watching Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh's accuser, testify and Kavanaugh offer his rebuttal, Severino insists it was just as volatile behind the scenes.
The book includes one account among senators and their staff right outside the hearing room when tempers flared.
""That room was full of dozens of people: senators, their staffers. And a fist fight nearly broke out,"" Severino explained. ""There was the frustration. They felt like senators weren't playing it straight and that there was interference by the staff that was inappropriate.""
As Justice Kavanaugh returns for his second term in October, the fallout from last year's contentious hearings still linger.
Republicans who voted for his confirmation are locked in tough re-election bids in Maine and Colorado. And some 2020 White House hopefuls have suggested packing the court to counter the conservative ideological shift.
Severino warns filling the next Supreme Court vacancy could actually be worse.
""What concerns me is, of course, the next seat could be a liberal justice stepping down with Donald Trump making the replacement,"" Severino told CBN News. ""If you think Kennedy to Kavanaugh is a shift, a liberal justice – Justice Ginsberg, for example – to a Trump nominee would be a night and day change on the court. And I think we could see the incentives built to have an even more outrageous nomination process.""

Liz Cheney (R-WY) is standing firm after facing fresh criticism for her desire to keep God in Congress. The dispute centers around critics who want to drop the words ""so help you God"" from a congressional committee's oath taken by witnesses who testify before Congress.
Back in January, the House Natural Resources Committee voted to keep the oath intact after facing backlash when Fox News reported that Democrats were trying to remove ""so help me God"" from the oath. 
At the time, Cheney, who holds the third-highest position in GOP House leadership, spoke against the move, saying, ""It is incredible, but not surprising, that the Democrats would try to remove God from committee proceedings in one of their first acts in the majority.""

""They really have become the party of Karl Marx,"" she had said.
Now the story is back in the headlines. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) appeared on a television program Sunday titled ""Freethought Matters,"" produced by the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF). The show airs in 12 cities across the US. 
Host Annie Laurie Gaylor, the co-founder of the FFRF, brought up the subject of the congressional oath to Huffman who is the founder of the Congressional Freethought Caucus. In 2017, Huffman publicly declared he is a humanist. 
""Well I thought it was a really good sign that the Democrats in Congress and the House have dropped the religious oath for witnesses who are swearing-in, and they did that kind of quietly at the beginning of the year and then I know there's been some pushback, but that shows respect for the Constitution and an increasing awareness that many of us just don't believe in a God,"" Gaylor said.
""Well, unfortunately, it's been kind of a sporadic standard,"" Huffman replied. ""Some committees have dropped the oath, others have not. I sit on the Natural Resources Committee and in our original proposed rules for the committee, we proposed that we drop the oath or we allow witnesses to simply say it voluntarily if they chose to, which to me makes perfect sense. And wouldn't you know it, Liz Cheney just went ballistic. She smelled blood in the water, went on Fox News and started ranting about how Democrats were dropping God from the Congress.""
""And at our next meeting, the Republicans, one-by-one, made these pronouncements about how, you know, we shouldn't be against God and Democrats were against God, and unfortunately my Democratic colleagues backed down, and so we now nominally still have that same oath,"" he said.
A Cheney spokesperson offered a response to Huffman's statement to CBN News, saying, ""Liz Cheney will always defend God. Period. If that bothers Rep. Huffman, we'll be praying for him."" 
After failing to court the evangelical vote in recent elections, last month Democrats embraced nonreligious voters in a new resolution.
As CBN News reported, the resolution was unanimously passed on Aug. 24 at the DNC's summer meeting in San Francisco, CA. 
The DNC noted that this unaffiliated group is the ""largest religious group within the Democratic Party, growing from 19% in 2007 to one in three today."" The resolution also asserts ""the Democratic Party is an inclusive organization that recognizes that morals, values, and patriotism are not unique to any particular religion, and are not necessarily reliant on having a religious worldview.""
""Religiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly share the Democratic Party's values,"" the resolution states and also adds they should advocate for ""rational public policy based on sound science and universal humanistic values.""
This is the first time a major political party has attempted to embrace America's non-believers. "

Meanwhile, a recent New York Times article highlighted a conservative group that's releasing embarrassing statements and social media posts by journalists, including a New York Times editor who posted anti-Semitic tweets in college.
While the Times says the editor's remarks are a violation of standards, it also accuses the group of trying to intimidate the press by seeking to ""harass and embarrass anyone affiliated with leading news organizations that are asking tough questions.""
One writer at Politico disagrees. Jack Shafer writes, ""Journalists don't deserve a get-out-of-bigotry-jail free card just because they're journalists.""
Dan Gainor of the Media Research Center told CBN News that some journalists seem to believe the First Amendment is only for them.
""The Constitution, last time I checked, belongs to all of us,"" Gainor said. ""That means freedom of the press belongs to each one of us, freedom of speech belongs to each one of us, so if you say or do really embarrassing things don't be surprised if someone goes and looks at your Twitter feed and says, 'Hey, I saw where you did this thing'.""
CBN News previously reported President Trump signaling that social media giants that engage in biased activities, like censoring conservatives, should also brace themselves for tough actions from his administration.
Axios points out that targeting media isn't new and that the liberal group ""Media Matters"" already does it, monitoring conservative news outlets for bias."

The tactic comes as several Democratic presidential candidates have boosted their religious talk on the campaign trail, trying to woo evangelical voters as they seek their party's nomination.  
For years, political pundits have said Democrats have a ""God problem"" in their efforts to try to sway evangelicals. This is the first time a major political party has attempted to embrace America's non-believers.

Kirsten Gillibrand Ends Bid to be Democrat's Presidential Nominee,"Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the presidential race Wednesday, abruptly ending a campaign that collapsed after low polling and major fundraising struggles.
""I know this isn't the result that we wanted,"" the 52-year-old New York senator said in an online video in which she didn't endorse any other 2020 Democratic White House hopeful. ""But it's important to know when it's not your time.""
Her decision came when she failed to qualify for a debate coming next month in Houston by not hitting 2% in at least four approved public opinion polls while securing 130,000 unique donors. She spent millions on online and TV ads to garner campaign contributions from people contributing as little as $1. 
On the eve of Wednesday's qualifying deadline, Gillibrand met with her family and decided that if a pair of polls set to be released the following morning didn't help her meet the polling threshold, she'd drop out. 
Both polls showed her at zero percent. 
Even before Gillibrand's announcement, the crowded Democrat presidential field of more than two dozen candidates had already begun to narrow. U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California left the 2020 race in July, followed by former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts earlier this month."

It could add to the struggle for Republicans trying to keep control of the Senate in the 2020 election.
""After much prayer and consultation with my family and my doctors, I have made the very tough decision to leave the U.S. Senate at the end of this year,"" he announced Wednesday.
The 74-year-old senator has been dealing with Parkinson's disease since 2013, and he was injured after falling this summer.
""I am leaving a job I love because my health challenges are taking their toll on me, my family and my staff,"" Isakson said. ""My Parkinson's has been progressing, and I am continuing physical therapy to recover from a fall in July. In addition, this week I had surgery to remove a growth on my kidney.""
""With the mounting health challenges I am facing, I have concluded that I will not be able to do the job over the long term in the manner the citizens of Georgia deserve. It goes against every fiber of my being to leave in the middle of my Senate term, but I know it's the right thing to do on behalf of my state,"" Isakson said.
Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp will appoint a temporary replacement when Isakson steps down December 31.  
Right now, Georgia has two Republican senators. But in November 2020, both of Georgia's Senate seats will now be on the ballot, setting up a rare battle in a state where Republicans are facing stiff challenges.
Isakson's Senate term would have ended in 2022. So whoever wins the special election to replace him in 2020 will only hold the seat for two years before facing reelection.

Sean Duffy of Wisconsin Resigning from Congress,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Republican Rep. Sean Duffy, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump who represents northern Wisconsin in Congress, announced Monday that he is resigning next month to spend more time with his family.
Duffy, 47, posted on Facebook that he recently learned that his ninth child, who is due in October, has a heart condition and ""will need even more love, time, and attention due to complications.""
Duffy, who was on the cast of MTV's ""The Real World: Boston"" in 1997, plans to resign on Sept. 23. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers will have to call a special election to fill the vacancy.
Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District is the state's largest, geographically, covering all or parts of 20 northern and northwestern counties.
Duffy's district has grown more conservative since he took office in 2011. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney carried it with 51% of the vote, compared with 48% that went to then-President Barack Obama. In 2016, Trump won it by 57% to 37% over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Duffy has been widely mentioned as a possible candidate for U.S. Senate or governor in 2022.
In his resignation announcement, he said being away from his family for four days a week to serve in Congress is ""challenging"" and ""I have always been open to signs from God when it comes to balancing my desire to serve both my family and my country.""
""I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby, and family need right now,"" Duffy said. ""It is not an easy decision - because I truly love being your Congressman - but it is the right decision for my family, which is my first love and responsibility.""
Duffy replaced 15-term Democratic Rep. Dave Obey, who announced his retirement 10 months after Duffy entered his first race for the seat. Duffy had been a district attorney for eight years before being elected to Congress.
Duffy met his future wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, on the set of MTV's ""Road Rules: All Stars"" in 1998. Together, they have eight children and Duffy announced in May that she was pregnant with their ninth child.
State Sen. Tom Tiffany, a Republican who lives in Duffy's district, was one of the first to release a statement after the retirement was announced, thanking Duffy for his service and wishing him luck. Tiffany did not immediately return a message seeking comment on whether he plans to run for the seat."

The meeting of the Group of Seven nations — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S. — in the beach resort town of Biarritz comes at one of the most unpredictable moments in Trump’s White House tenure, with his public comments and decision-making increasingly erratic and acerbic of late.
Trump, growing more isolated in Washington, faces a tepid reception on the world stage, where a list of challenges awaits. Anxiety is growing over a global slowdown , and there are new points of tension with allies on trade, Iran and Russia.

Trump Considers New Tax Cut for Middle Class, Blasts Fed After Investors Rattled by Recession Fears
Trump Admin Talks 'Tax Cuts 2.0', Pushes Flagging Euro Economies to Go 'Pro-Growth' at G7  
Recession Obsession: When Is a Downturn Coming, and What Can Trump Do to Fight It?
Fears of a financial downturn are spreading, meaning the need for cooperation and a collective response is essential. Yet Trump has ridiculed Germany for its economic travails at a time when he may have to turn to Chancellor Angela Merkel and others to help blunt the force of China’s newly aggressive tariffs on U.S. goods. Those trade penalties, combined with the economic slowdown, have raised political alarms for Trump’s reelection effort .
Before he left Washington, Trump declared that U.S. businesses with dealings in China are “hereby ordered” to begin moving home. There was no immediate explanation of just what he expected or what authority he had to make it happen. He also imposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports.
“Tariffs are working out very well for us,” Trump said. “People don’t understand that yet.”
Earlier, he had made light of a sharp drop in the financial markets in reaction to his latest trade actions. His tongue-in-cheek tweet speculated that the Dow’s plunge could be tied to the departure of a lower-tier candidate in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
In recent days, Trump has sent mixed signals on a number of policy fronts. At one point, he moved to simmer the trade conflict with China in order to ease the impact on American consumers during the holiday shopping season. At another, he flip-flopped on the need for tax cuts to stimulate an economy that Trump publicly insists is rocketing.
Feeding Trump’s anxiety, aides say, is his realization that the economy — the one sturdy pillar undergirding his bid for a second term — is undeniably wobbly.
Now the president who has long eschewed multilateralism hopes to use his time in Biarritz to rally global leaders around the need to do more to promote economic growth. He engineered a late change to the summit agenda, requesting a working session on global economic issues.
For the world leaders, it was the latest example of unpredictability from Trump. After two-and-a-half years of Trump’s presidency, traditional American allies have come to expect the unexpected. Increasingly they are looking elsewhere for leadership.
“They have figured out how to deal with this president,” said Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think what we’re going to see out of this summit is, on the one hand, an effort by countries and the leaders to align with the president, but also an understanding that we’ll have to do more without the U.S. president.”
Trump arrived on Air Force One after changing airplanes in Bordeaux, on account of the shorter runway in Biarritz. His motorcade passed through barricaded streets on his way to the heavily secured summit site, as some residents looked on from windows overhead.
The annual G-7 summit has historically been used to highlight common ground among the world’s leading democracies. But in a bid to work around Trump’s impulsiveness, French President Emmanuel Macron has eschewed plans for a formal joint statement from this gathering.
Last year’s summit, hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, ended in acrimony when Trump felt he had been slighted by Trudeau after the president left the meeting.
Trump tweeted insults at Trudeau from aboard Air Force One as he flew to a summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Trump withdrew his signature from the statement of principles that all seven nations had agreed to.
At his first G-7 summit in 2017, Trump’s strong feelings against climate change roiled the gathering in Italy.
Trump has made his “America first” priorities clear at every turn.
At a recent campaign rally in New Hampshire, the crowd roared with approval when Trump said: “I’m the President of the United States of America. I’m not the president of the world.”
Addressing the global slowdown isn’t the only pressing challenge that Trump has discovered requires joint action.
For more than a year, his administration has struggled with persuading European leaders to repatriate captured fighters from the Islamic State group. So far his entreaties have been met with deaf ears.
Alterman and Heather Conley, the Europe expert at CSIS, both said Macron appeared to be trying to fill the void left by Trump on the world stage, noting the French leader’s recent efforts to try to reduce tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
Many of the summit proceedings will take place behind closed doors, in intimate settings designed for the leaders to develop personal relationships with one another.
Trump, White House aides said, was looking forward to meeting with new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , the brash pro-Brexit leader whose election he’d backed. Trump has scheduled individual meetings with several of his counterparts, including Macron, Trudeau, Merkel, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Other topics on the agenda will be the clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong; Iran’s renewed nuclear enrichment and interference with shipping in the Strait of Hormuz; and the Islamic State prisoners currently imprisoned by American-backed Kurdish forces in Syria.
Increasingly fearful of an economic slowdown’s potential to diminish his 2020 electoral chances, Trump intended to press leaders about what can be done to spur growth in the U.S. and abroad, as well as to open European, Japanese and Canadian markets to American manufacturers and producers. Trump has imposed or threatened to impose tariffs on all three markets in his pursuit of free, fair and reciprocal trade.
It is unclear what substantive steps could be taken by the leaders to address the global slowdown, and much of that discussion stands to be dominated by disagreements on Trump’s trade policies.
While on French soil, Trump also intends to raise with Macron and the other leaders the issue of a digital services tax that France has imposed on major technology companies such as Google and Facebook despite Trump’s threats of retaliatory tariffs on French wine.
The Trump administration says the tax targets and discriminates against U.S. businesses.
The European Council’s president, Donald Tusk, has promised European Union action if the U.S. follows through.
