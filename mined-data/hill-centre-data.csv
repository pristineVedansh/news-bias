could lose the 2020 election. Even traditional red states such as Texas are now in play. The president is in need of a focused and effective message for his campaign. Rather than continuously slam the cognitive function of Joe Biden, Trump must hone a revised version of his 2016 banner that Democrats are major threats to the prosperity of middle class Americans. If the president drives this message home consistently, then he can win a second term in November.
So far the strategy for Trump has been to simply portray his opponent as doddering and impaired. Indeed, voters already realize Biden is at best an inelegant speaker. Age has taken its toll on his mental acuity and ability to get a message across. Trump tried to drive the point home by calling him “Sleepy Joe” and challenging him to take a mental acuity test. But Trump has inadvertently given Biden two advantages with this strategy.
First, it allows Biden to stay in his basement by citing the coronavirus and giving the occasional press conference. He can avoid making his mistakes and still come out ahead. Just by reading scripted sound bites and looking like he knows what day it is, Biden can surpass this very low bar set by the president. Biden could walk across campaign season while hiding more of his cognitive decline from the national audience. There is even a growing movement to cancel the 2020 debates. The University of Notre Dame has already said it will not host the first debate due to the pandemic.
Second, if Trump is simply playing defense, he is not actively appealing to middle class voters, leaving the door open for the left to set the narrative. Democrats can send out the image of Biden as a blue collar hero. “Did you know he was born in Scranton? Did you know he rode the Amtrak home to be with his family?” Slap a hard hat on him and Biden ameliorates much of the “learn to code” elitism seen with the Hillary Clinton campaign.
Compared to the attacks on Clinton, those being thrown at Biden have not borne the same fruit because they are out of step with what his candidacy truly represents. The president must prove to the Rust Belt workers that he carried in 2016 that his opponent is against their interests. Biden wants to restrict fracking that revitalized states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Biden also wants to repeal the tax cuts and end the online sale of firearms. His watered down version of the Green New Deal would further hinder our competitiveness, harm fossil fuel workers, and stick on another $2 trillion to our already exploding national debt. These are several of the messages that the president needs to be hammering relentlessly. Instead, Trump is daring Biden to take a test which includes identifying an elephant.
The president cannot afford to lose blue collar workers in the Midwest. He turned the margin of 12 points with white voters for Romney in 2012 to the margin of 30 points in 2016. It was this surge that put Trump over the top in states across the Rust Belt. But polling now shows Trump behind in the former industrial states that led him to victory. There remains a chance of a “Shy Tory” situation where Republicans represent a majority silenced by the shaming of conservatives in the media. Yet the numbers of Trump are worse today than they were before his surprise win four years ago.
Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks
Trump campaign manager: We want more debates against Biden, and sooner
The president has time to turn these tides. After all, his lowest point came one month before the 2016 election. But the effort is heavier this time. It is easier throwing stones as the outsider looking in. As commander in chief, the onus is on Trump to show voters that his policies are effective. Rather than instigate arguments over senility, Trump must prove the economy is gearing up for a once in a lifetime comeback from the financial downturn caused by the coronavirus, aiding middle class workers the most.
If Trump cannot prove the nation is resilient, then he is in trouble this fall. He must remind voters why it is a risk to return to the policies of the last administration that harmed the heart of the country for almost a decade. If he fails, he might have to call moving vans to the White House.

to withdraw 12,000 troops stationed in Germany. The decision has rightly drawn opposition from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as concern from our European allies. The decision not only goes against the national security interests of the United States, but it works against the political interests of Trump.
This move by the administration further fractures our relationships with our critical European allies who count on American forces for protection and stability in the region. The decision emboldens Russia by leaving our European allies with less defense and less coordination across the region. It raises the threat of conflict and military aggression from Russia.
The American presence and military infrastructure in Germany is critical for global stability. Germany sits in the center of the European continent, and forces in this area ensure the United States can effectively work with our allies to counter hostile activity by our adversaries. Any movement of troops away from Germany to other areas across the European continent only diminishes the ability of the United States to effectively react to and retaliate against military aggression from Russia and even China.
We can back look to history to see how Russia might respond to American troops leaving this region. When President Obama withdrew 7,000 troops from Germany in 2012, Vladimir Putin responded by invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea in violation of international laws. The decision by Trump follows a disturbing pattern of his inconsistent approach to foreign policy, by which he acts rashly and in a way that disregards our critical allies and national security interests, while emboldening our adversaries.
In my new book, “The End of Democracy,” I write about how the alliance between Russia and China poses a tangible threat to the interests of the United States, and how the foreign policy of this administration has only served to rein in our position as the world leader. Under his time in office, Trump has berated our closest European allies while sorely failing to hold our adversaries like Russia and China accountable for military aggression and verified attacks on our election system in the United States.
Trump has also taken concerning steps that have left our deployed forces at risk while advancing the threat of armed conflict. He withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty and expressed future intents to withdraw from the New Start Treaty. His ceding of authority on the world stage could not come at a worse time for him. With fewer than 100 days until the election, Trump is behind Joe Biden in the polls but continues to alienate those independent voters and moderate Republicans who have defected from him.
This rather erratic withdrawal of troops from Germany lends credence to the political narrative of Democrats that Trump is unfit to be commander in chief, has worked against the interests of the United States, and acts in a way that empowers our adversaries. Predictably, the domestic political backlash to his decision was swift. Leading Democrats have very harshly criticized the withdrawal, as have several moderate Republicans.

American foreign policy has become isolationist under this administration. We now seem to have lost our conviction that the United States, once the standard bearer of democracy, must engage with the world to defend our allies who share our values. The greatest deterrent which we hold against those nefarious ties between Russia and China remains our commitments to our important allies and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
It is more essential than ever for Joe Biden to reassure voters that he has the foreign policy experience to be an effective commander in chief. He will work to affirm our promise to our allies, stand up to our adversaries, and restore the position of the United States as the world leader.

0,07/31/20 04:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/509978-recasting-how-we-cast-votes,Recasting how we cast votes,"How we cast votes in federal elections is broken. We elect representatives into offices with terms that may last as many as six years, yet the process for casting a vote must be done within a 12-hour window, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The roots of a designated day for voting dates back to 1845, when congress declared a national election day.  There is much at stake to get every and all votes verified and counted, to reflect the preferences of the majority.  
Regrettably, voter turnout for presidential elections is dismal, with midterm elections even worse. This makes each election not an indicator of population sentiment, but rather, a sample of this sentiment. Since the presidential election of 1932, the highest proportion of the voting age population that cast a vote in the presidential election was nearly 63 percent (in 1960), while the lowest proportion was 49 percent (in 1996). This means that between one-half and five-eighths of eligible voters determine who wins the most important and powerful office in the world.     
Between eight and 12 battleground states determine who wins the White House. Electoral college votes in these states are earned by which party can get the majority of voters to show up. Placing the outcome of such a high stakes election on the uncertainty of a single day is neither reasonable nor sensible. Adding COVID-19 into the uncertainty equation this year makes this antiquated ballot casting process even more risky and unacceptable. Given that much has changed in our nation over the past 175 years since the national election day decision was enacted, perhaps it is time to rethink how we cast votes for those who represent our interests, spend our tax dollars and craft our national and foreign policies. 
Adding both technology and time to the election process can improve the likelihood that the sample of votes cast reflects the sentiment of the population. 
Our internet-of-everything, artificial intelligence driven world has transformed numerous facets of everyday life. We can access our bank account on the other side of the globe with a piece of plastic containing a microchip and a four-digit pin. The census bureau relies on the internet to collect demographic information that has far-reaching economic and social implications over the next decade. We are placing an ever-growing reliance on computer systems and machine learning to diagnose diseases and improve population health. Yet, we view with suspicion the possibility of using similar technological advances to choose our representatives in state and federal elections. Why can we not accomplish the same level of trust, verification and anonymity of votes with our elections that we assume in so many other places?    
Security breaches occur and make splashy headlines. Yet, when we consider how much of our information is available, and the small percentage that gets used maliciously, we realize that precautions can be taken to ensure that the results from a well defined event — like an election — can be secured. Security breaches are a red herring in the pursuit and implementation of technology for casting ballots.     
Even retaining paper ballots, as the AAAS EPI Center recommends, does not preclude technology from facilitating the collection, counting and validation of ballots. Adding multiple methods for casting ballots is sensible, it empowers voters and increases the likelihood of higher voter turnout.     
One unspoken reason that technology is often rejected by politicians to manage elections has nothing to do with security. In almost every election, one candidate has a voter preference edge over another candidate. Technology would make it more difficult for the underdog candidate to overcome any deficit if every eligible voter is able to cast his or her vote. In such cases, the sample preference approaches the population preference, which minimizes the impact of politics on the election process. This means that politicians and political parties are motivated to retain the uncertainty of who will vote, effectively providing a lever to manipulate election outcomes. The book, “Victory Lab” openly describes this process.  
The second factor is time. With technology in place to facilitate voting and the casting of ballots, a voting day can become a voting week or even a voting month, as was the case in the early 19th century. Widening the window of opportunities to cast ballots can only increase the percentage of eligible votes cast. Perhaps mobile or virtual voting centers can be launched to bring the opportunity to cast a vote to the voters, rather than asking the voters to visit voting precincts. 
Trump campaign manager: We want more debates against Biden, and sooner
There is no one size-fits-all solution. Multiple methods by which ballots can be cast widens the footprint of opportunities for voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote. Simplifying ballots will also make it easier for voters to express their choices. Perhaps even decoupling federal, state and local elections so that not all elections are held at the same time, with the same ballot, to further simplify the voting process.    
Elections are about political choices, yet there is no place for politics in the election process. Just as gerrymandering tarnishes how congressional districts are drawn, casting ballots using antiquated and ineffectual rules and regulations taint election processes. The time is ripe to get politics out of political election voting processes, and allow the voters to regain the power of choice that our democracy affords them.

0,07/31/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/509930-america-must-be-serious-with-russian-election-interference,America must be serious with Russian election interference,"The Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament released a report on Russian influence in recent elections. The British media covered such security drawbacks, calling them willful ignorance or outright blindness. But this is more of a perfect storm that combines politics with the failure from imagination. What is clear is that Moscow sought to interfere in the European Union referendum, the Scottish referendum on independence, and the British election which Boris Johnson won for prime minister.
Yet the last few leaders of the United Kingdom all failed to see the Russian forest for the trees. Politics and hubris combined to ignore the threat. The security services found themselves in an awkward and unfair position. On the one hand, British intelligence warned of Russian activity but wanted to avoid wading into politics. This hot potato, as the British report labeled it, was perhaps best handed over to the Electoral Commission or the British agency that handles the media, both entities that are terribly prepared to handle the campaigns run by Russian intelligence and internet trolls.
This dynamic is not exclusive to London and is acutely felt in Washington. President Trump
appears reactionary to anything related to Moscow due to his fear that recognition of Russian influence in the election four years ago, or any point thereafter, would taint his administration or undermine its legitimacy. This is to say nothing of the confusing White House policy toward Moscow, which in the marked absence of any clear articulation of priorities, leaves conspiracy theories to run rampant on the internet.
American intelligence also continues to warn of more influence activities coming later this fall. With fewer than 100 days before voters head to the polls, officials have warned that election security remains a priority in the intelligence community. However, there is only so much the intelligence community can do to bolster election security before this fall arrives.
Historian David Shimer wrote his book about how President Obama feared direct election tampering much more than foreign influence of voters in a major misunderstanding of the threat, and one that must have been better informed by American efforts to influence foreign elections. If Washington is not serious about foreign interference in American elections, be it from Russia or elsewhere, the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.
Congress needs to hold hearings on Russian and Chinese disinformation operations, what they are, what they mean, and how they are manifested online and otherwise. This means that members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees should take off their partisan hats and serve the country as they should. There has yet to be a worldwide threats briefing, although one may be happening soon, but Congress must do more.
While it is overly hopeful and maybe even naive, Congress must set aside politics and with one voice declare that foreign interference in American elections is unacceptable. This cannot be a watered down statement, but a forceful declaration by both the Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill that such activity is unacceptable to the United States.
Congress must also raise pressure on the social media platforms that have continued to wash their hands of any responsibility. Lawmakers should not turn a blind eye to the use of social media platforms as means for election interference. It is disappointing, but not surprising, that it took advertisers pulling funding to change the behavior of Facebook on hate speech. What about Moscow gladly using it to interfere in the American election?
The State Department, the Treasury Department, and intelligence leaders must be authorized to retaliate whenever interference is found. Whether with sanctions, naming and shaming, selective release of compromising information on foreign leaders and their dealings, or other mechanisms, consequences for foreign interference must be established. Russia and China will continue such activity since there is no real punishment.

Tensions flare as GOP's Biden probe ramps up 
As many experts have noted before, the United States must work to build a more educated population, one that is more immune to disinformation and propaganda. This is not about teaching the public what to think, but instead how to better engage with the information online and elsewhere that is shared. It is a generational endeavor, but it has to start now.
Foreign election interference should not and must not be a partisan issue. This is a threat to the foundation of our democracy, one that will taint and will affect both parties. American citizens must have confidence that this political system is strong, that their votes matter, and that candidates are elected freely and fairly. Anything less than that is unacceptable.

0,07/30/20 11:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/509751-congress-must-use-its-tools-to-influence-the-decisions-of-war,Congress must use its tools to influence the decisions of war,"In matters of peace and war, no one seems satisfied with Congress. Over the last two decades of conflict, and despite its formal powers to declare wars, appropriate funds, and organize the armed forces, Congress mostly deferred to the executive branch and used more of a rhetorical fight than actively shaping American wars. It does not have to be this way.
Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle seek a greater voice on national security matters. Since last year, bipartisan groups condemned the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, punished Russia for bad behaviors, and sought limitations on American force drawdowns in Syria and South Korea. Congress voted to invoke the War Powers Resolution for the first time, attempting to curtail intervention in Yemen, and this spring passed legislation to require legislative approval for war with Iran.
These cases of renewed activism by members of Congress are striking, but these actual effects have been limited. Presidential vetoes, disputes over renewing authorizations for the use of military force, and the lack of support for legislative oversight mechanisms have all together frustrated many attempts to shape the course of American conflicts. Congress has to continue to pursue legislative means on this matter, but its relatively neglected informal toolkit stands as the likelier path to influence.
By exercising its informal influence, which means everything other than legislating, members of Congress can test intelligence and define likely costs and benefits before declaring wars. They can inject the discussion of various courses of action into the public debate outside conference rooms in the basement of the Pentagon. They can also press to initiate a worthy conflict by changing narratives or avoid unwise ones.
In doing so, they can significantly expand oversight beyond war initiation to include a prevention, preparation, conduct, and termination. Congress should focus on three activities in its oversight toolkit. These activities are obtaining and sharing information, injecting more ideas into the decision making process, and shoring up the foundations of oversight.
Taking steps to gather accurate information is key. High quality hearings that pursue a line of inquiry over time can yield meaningful insights into national security matters. Ongoing executive branch briefings serve to encourage the understanding of risks, threats, authorities, and complex vocabulary across member offices and between legislative and executive branch officials. Sending delegations to war zones and relevant locations can also create valuable opportunities to assess ground truth.
Convening outside experts, including those critical of existing policy, gives members alternatives to prevailing narratives and assessments, notably when the executive branch is slow to respond. Committees can launch investigations of aspects of a conflict, its costs and impacts, or operational decisions. Members can also send letters to agencies, meet foreign officials, and consume intelligence. While the executive branch has advantages in information and establishing narratives, Congress has real strengths in convening alternative sources of information.
Congress should actively inject ideas into the decision making process. Members are better positioned than most to drive media coverage and express dissent. When made part of a campaign, members can use floor statements, press releases, hearing remarks, and other opportunities to shape policy and the debate where it is crafted. Whether in editorials or cable news interviews, members of Congress can act like Washington reporters for local media and elite signalers in national media.
This is best done when the foundations of national security oversight are strong. The key is to build trust in relationships between members, their staffs, and the agencies that they oversee. The complex national security environment, which cuts across the committee jurisdictions in Congress, demands a continuous and collegial practice of oversight duties.

Much focus on Capitol Hill revolves around ending the “forever wars” in order to devote attention and resources to other issues like great power competition and needs at home. Yet history suggests the United States will remain in the military intervention business in some form for a while. With that reality comes the need to differentiate between contingencies, test prevailing assumptions, oversee ongoing operations, and constantly improve the ability of American forces to attain the national objectives. Congress has a vital role to play in this. By better deploying its informal toolkit, it will better wage the policy battles that overlay the fights.
Congress can question existing military and political strategies and test assessments about the battle. Members can form ground perspectives, offer alternative approaches, and encourage allied involvement. Perhaps most important, they can lobby for needed change of course, elevate the voices of stakeholders set aside by the executive branch, push for an end to failing wars, or disincentive a dangerous troop withdrawal. Moreover, members of Congress can do all of this without taking a single vote.

0,07/29/20 02:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/509573-joe-biden-is-the-candidate-for-israel,Joe Biden is the candidate for Israel,"Six years ago, terrorist organization Hamas launched rockets onto Israel, which was perilously close to losing an element of its defensive shield. I remember it and recall how Joe Biden
acted as vice president.
Biden would often tell me how his support for Israel was formed. He was a young kid sitting at the dinner table. It was around the time of the debate on the establishment of the modern state of Israel. His father was unable to comprehend how anyone could oppose this historic step. To this Irish American Catholic salesman, it was obvious why Israel had to exist. The establishment of a state for the Jewish people was the only way to fulfill the promise of “never again” after the tragedy of the Holocaust.
It was the first time Biden ever heard that phrase, and he never forgot the lesson. When Israel is in trouble, you simply cannot sit still. You have to act quickly. When I talked to Biden about Israel, the conversation always came back to that dinner table with his family. It is ingrained in his memory and imprinted on his soul. It is more than a pleasant story. It is the foundation for why Israel can always count on Biden in its hours of need.
In the summer of 2014, Hamas had started shooting a barrage of rockets toward Israeli schools and backyards around the Gaza border. The Israeli military deployed its Iron Dome system, designed to stop and destroy the kinds of shorter range missiles used in a remarkable feat of technological development built with assistance from the United States. But the rockets were coming so fast and so furious that Iron Dome batteries were running out, and Israel would be left without its first line of defense.
I was a member of Congress at the time, and several of us received a call from a representative of the Israeli Embassy, who pleaded with us to fund an emergency package to replenish the Iron Dome stockpile. I spoke with numerous members of the House Appropriations Committee about how to get this done. But it turned out the wheels were already turning as Dan Shapiro, the American ambassador to Israel, had sent the message to the National Security Council, and it was with the Oval Office.
The unmistakable answer of President Obama and Vice President Biden was swift to get it done. That is when Biden went to work, talking to the Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, hammering out the details, and making sure the process would be expedited. The measure passed, the bill was signed, and the aid was sent to Israel.
The Jewish state was in trouble, but with Biden at the White House as vice president, we did not sit back or wait. We moved fast and got it done. That is what Biden has always done. That is what his lifetime of commitment to Israel looks like. That is the kind of determination and resolve that Biden would bring to the table as president of the United States.
First, his administration would maintain an ironclad commitment to Israel and uphold every letter of the memorandum of understanding signed by the United States and Israel in 2016, which included the unprecedented $38 billion investment to bolster security for this key ally.
Second, his administration would certainly fight hard against any attempt to unfairly single out and delegitimize Israel, whether this comes from the United Nations or the boycott and sanctions movement, while protecting the right to free speech in the United States, which simply must not allow challenges to the existence of Israel or any antisemitism.
Third, his foreign policy would restore the pursuit of a peaceful two state solution negotiated by the parties themselves that ensures the future of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Finally, when Palestinian officials incite terror, spew lies about the Jewish people, or teach hatred to many children, Biden would not hesitate to strongly call it out.

When Israel makes its decisions to expand settlements or march toward annexation that would preclude those hopes for a Palestinian state, and which violate positions held in the United States for decades, officials in his administration would explain why that is wrong. The best course for Palestinian rights is to deepen these security ties with Israel, renounce violence, reform curriculums, and build the economy.
Harry Truman, the president who first acknowledged an independent Israel, had a frame on his desk that read “the buck stops here.” When Israel is in trouble, we should not have to look anywhere but the Oval Office to know where the buck stops. If Biden is president, he will not tweet or delay. He will act quickly and do what is right.

0,07/29/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/509527-democrats-failed-to-make-case-in-bizarre-hearing-with-william-barr,Democrats failed to make case in bizarre hearing with William Barr,"Winston Churchill said, “The best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter.” If he knew members of the House Judiciary Committee, he could have cut that time in half, as they might convince people that democracy is a failed experiment.
The hearing with Attorney General William Barr
had been long awaited for weeks as a way to get answers on issues ranging from the controversial clearing of Lafayette Park, to the intervention in the case of Roger Stone, to the violence across various cities. Instead, the public watched as both parties engaged in hours of primal scream therapy, with Barr for the most part forced to remain as silent as some life size anatomical doll.
The videos shown by the rival parties captured the utter absurdity of the day. Republicans played what could only be described as eight minutes of virtual “riot porn” for the hard right. By the end, one would think much of the nation is a smoking dystopian hellscape. Democrats then played their alternate reality video showing thousands of protesters chanting together in perfect harmony. Add a soundtrack to the scene and you would have a soda commercial. There was absolutely nothing in the middle.
After testifying recently on the Lafayette Park controversy, I was one of those who had great expectations for answers to significant questions. Instead, Democrats dramatically demanded answers and then stopped Barr from answering by immediately “taking back the time.” It happened over and over during the hearing. Democrats simply did not want to hear any answers that would undermine the popular narratives.
Several Democrats insisted the clearing of Lafayette Park was for the sole purpose of a photo for President Trump in front of Saint John Church. Barr sought to explain that there was no connection between the plan formed the weekend before and the photo, but he was stopped by members like Hank Johnson saying “you clearly will not answer the question” before he could even start to answer. It got more and more bizarre.
Barr was repeatedly cut off by Democrats, while Republicans, who have done the same thing to witnesses in other hearings, raged against their colleagues. The result was mayhem. While Barr sarcastically referred to Jerrold Nadler as a “real class act” after Nadler refused a request for a break, the hearing had as much class as a demolition derby.
Just as Democrats did not want to hear the facts regarding Lafayette Park, they were adamant in not allowing Barr to refute other popular narratives in the mainstream media, like the changed sentencing recommendation for Stone. Barr struggled to give specific facts on that case as Democrats quickly interrupted him. Barr then used questions from Republicans to try to answer. He explained that Trump never spoke to him of the sentencing of Stone and that Barr had never raised the sentencing issue.
Rather, Barr insisted that the change was raised to him by a new United States attorney who felt the trial prosecutors were wildly off base in their demand for up to nine years of prison. Many of us in the criminal defense area raised the same objection. The Justice Department then decided to change the recommendation to be consistent with past cases.
However, Barr said the trial prosecutors ignored those instructions from their superiors, requiring the filing of a correction. When Trump posted a reckless tweet the next morning on the original recommendation, it had nothing to do with the decision to change it. When Barr tried to note that the trial judge agreed with the recommendation in the case as well as the ultimate sentence of 40 months, Democrats cut him off again.
For Republicans, less was also more during the hearing. Journalist Jake Tapper responded to the video they showed of rioting, which included a series of reporters talking about peaceful protests. Tapper showed that the videos had been edited to cut off the same reporters who eventually note that largely peaceful protests became violent rioting.
No one seemed eager to hear anything beyond sound bites. Barr offered statistics that the shootings of African Americans by police officers has been on the decline and that the eight African Americans who died in the previous year from police shootings represented a smaller number than whites shot by police officers. He also argued that police are statistically less likely to use lethal force in dealing with black suspects.
Those claims are subject to challenge, and the hearing could have had a discussion of systemic racism, but no one wanted that type of deep dive. When Barr disagreed there is systemic racism in the legal system, Cedric Richmond insisted, “When you all came here and brought your top staff, you brought no black people. That is systematic racism.”

Indeed, Democrats seemed intent to not allow Barr to say anything in the hearing. When Pramila Jayapal accused him of ordering officers “to tear gas, pepper spray, and beat protesters and injure Americans who were just simply exercising their First Amendment,” Barr began to correct the claims but was cut off by Jayapal, who warned, “I just asked for a yes or no. So let me just tell you, I am starting to lose my temper.”
By that point, many Americans undoubtedly had moved beyond anger, as both parties fiddle with politics while the nation burns. Churchill yet again almost captured the moment when he derided one British prime minister, the Earl of Rosebery, as “a great man in an era of small events.” What the public witnessed yesterday were small people in an era of great events. It was not the lack of interest in answers but the lack of interest in solutions that was readily apparent to anyone watching the hearing.

0,07/28/20 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/509403-why-religious-freedom-is-special,Why religious freedom is special,"A report from the Commission on Unalienable Human Rights at the State Department has sparked considerable controversy. Critics objected that the report said the Founders had considered religious freedom one of the foremost rights. However, the Founders did believe that. They also wrote that God, not government, is the source of our rights. As the Declaration of Independence states, “We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.”
These beliefs are not unique to Americans. Religions around the world are the foundation for human rights and critical to their flourishing. Religious freedom is indeed the foremost right for people around the world because it protects what makes us human. To understand why religious freedom is widely cherished around the world, consider a Christian pastor in China, a Jewish woman in Germany, and a Muslim blogger in Saudi Arabia.
Pastor Wang Yi led a Christian congregation independent of the state in China. He is now in prison. Christina Feist was at synagogue listening to the reading of the Torah when loud explosions and smoke interrupted. A gunman shot holes into the wooden door as the cantor told worshippers to flee for their lives from the service. Muslim blogger Raif Badawi liked a Christian Facebook page which stated, “Jews, Muslims, Christians, and atheists are all equal.” For this and posts about the role of women and politics, Saudi authorities sentenced him to whipping and prison.
Each of them sought to live according to their deepest beliefs. Princeton University professor Robert George described humans as “conscientious truth seekers” who share a desire to ask fundamental questions about our origins, the existence of a creator, and the meaning of life. People in the remotest corners of the earth over history have sought to build lives and communities around their beliefs. This is what makes us human.
It was a powerful point of agreement among the philosophers, diplomats, and lawyers who drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt in 1948. They came from all over the map, geographically and ideologically. Their beliefs about human rights were informed by diverse philosophies and religions from Marxism and Confucianism to Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Christianity.
But they all agreed that human dignity obligates governments to respect our human rights. The declaration cites human dignity as the basis for the human rights contained in it. In its first article, the declaration also states that human beings “are endowed with reason and conscience and should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood.” Because both reason and conscience inspire respect for human rights, protecting the unique capacities helps to realize all human rights around the world.
While the United Nations General Assembly approved the declaration without a single dissenting vote, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion are still widely violated today. Tragically, 80 percent of people around the world experience high restrictions on religious freedom with the greatest burden falling on religious minorities in society.
There is a popular misconception that religious diversity is the source of social conflict, but as comparisons by faith expert Brian Grim have shown, it is suppression of religious freedom that escalates social hostilities into violence. Congress recognized that religious freedom violations threaten international peace and security, and it passed the International Religious Freedom Act that President Clinton signed in 1998. The law made religious freedom a foundation of United States policies on the world.

The report from the Commission on Unalienable Human Rights did not set religious freedom above other unalienable human rights as critics argued. But it provided a much needed clarification between unalienable human rights and positive rights. Unalienable human rights belong to everyone everywhere at all times and are not dependent on any state, and positive rights are created by certain governments for the enjoyment of their own citizens at certain times. The report concludes that “human rights are the standard against which we judge the justice of positive laws.”
The United States has sought to protect religious freedom for everyone everywhere, not simply because it is a value of Americans. It is more than that. It is an unalienable right protecting something special about being human as we seek truth and live according to our consciences.

Approved last month, largely in secrecy with astonishing speed, and then almost immediately imposed on the city, the legislation provides Beijing nearly unlimited authority. The Chinese domination of Hong Kong, which until now was behind the scenes, burst into the open with the passage of this law and the crackdown on democracy protests in recent months.
Under the law, the Hong Kong police can censor content on the internet, search without warrants, surveil suspects without court orders, and shut down websites and take them offline. The Hong Kong police has power to crack down on protests, intervene with the Hong Kong legal system, and suppress the rights of free speech and expression of Hong Kong citizens. The law takes Hong Kong behind the great firewall of China.
In any other era, this law and this behavior would be cause for significant concern and outrage. But imagine combining this new sweeping authority with unparalleled application of technology to control what you see, what you do, and where you go, all under the guise of social credit. That is the future Hong Kong is facing. It could well be a future in the Western world where the data of citizens is used against them if the Chinese Communist Party and Huawei are successful in building the 5G network.
The only laws China respects are its own and not international laws or the privacy laws of other countries. This is reflected in how its companies do business. Huawei, for instance, is a company that hopes citizens will trust it with their data and its 5G network. Among other things, Huawei steals intellectual property, launders money, violates sanctions, and incentivizes trade secret theft. Indeed, if this were any other company from any other country, doing business with them would be unthinkable.
We need to ensure the Chinese Communist Party does not control the 5G network. Thankfully, the United States is taking steps to prevent this from occurring. The White House is finalizing regulations that would prevent the federal government from buying products from any company that uses Huawei or four other Chinese firms. The Federal Communications Commission has also designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats, cutting them off from billions of dollars in subsidies.
Moreover, the United Kingdom has announced a halt on the installation of any Huawei equipment and will remove all equipment already installed by 2027. This is a great step forward, and this recent decision is undoubtedly motivated by the behavior of China toward the former British territory of Hong Kong. Other countries must see this decision as a signal as to how serious the national security threat posed by Huawei gear is.
China and Huawei will, however, not go quietly into the night. They are working to push back on the accurate perception that they are bad faith actors. In response to the legal arrest of Huawei financial executive Meng Wanzhou by Canadian authorities, China arrested two Canadian citizens, consultant Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is absolutely right in saying that in this case in Canada, China is “hostage taking” to pressure Ottawa on Huawei. The Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, Liu Xiaoming, warned London against “gross interference” in response to the British decision to open a pathway to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kong citizens who may flee the city in response to the national security law.

Ignorance of such behavior and conduct by China is no longer an excuse. Its imposition of near totalitarian restrictions on Hong Kong, along with its imprisonment of more than one million Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps and its aggressive behavior across the South China Sea illustrates its intentions better than any Western analysis could. The aggressive use of data by China to restrict movement and speech is not something that should be imported anywhere, but that is precisely what Beijing hopes countries will do by buying and installing Huawei equipment.
We cannot allow Beijing to control our digital future, and that means the United States must push back on its attempts to dominate 5G. The federal government must continue to advance regulations that effectively limit access of Huawei and other Chinese companies to the American market. Around the world, we must continue to raise the awareness of the malign behavior, bad intentions, and illegal activities of Beijing. Anything less will cede us the future of China, and we cannot afford that scenario.

0,07/26/20 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/509099-american-voters-deserve-facts-on-outside-influence-on-this-election,American voters deserve facts on outside influence on this election,"Four years ago, Russian influence on the American election rocked our politics. Broad concern led United States intelligence agencies to reveal much of what they knew. Today the threat remains, but the attention has faded and the transparency is gone. Wild allegations fill this vacuum, like the claim by President Trump
that other countries could print millions of mail ballots. Meanwhile, real evidence of active foreign influence is kept secret. The public hears only vague warnings of ongoing dangers.
Voters should demand actionable intelligence on foreign influence which is targeting the 2020 election. After all, the principal defense remains the public itself. Basic information can help citizens spot hallmarks of foreign manipulation and fact check their own leaders. Who are the main foreign actors? What are their agendas and narratives? The federal government can answer these questions, but it remarkably has chosen not to.
Indeed, as a former intelligence officer who spent years tracking foreign adversaries online, I am simply dismayed by this silence. I am afraid that the coronavirus has only raised the stakes. With campaigns going virtual, foreign trolls and propagandists have new avenues to covertly manipulate political discourse. Yet instead of educating American voters, government leaders resist public testimony. Meanwhile, tens of millions of voters have already cast primary ballots, and the general election now looms.
Just consider what the American people have been told about the major threat of Russia. Over one year ago, the director of national intelligence released a two sentence assessment of Russian influence efforts that said Moscow “will continue to focus on aggravating social and racial tensions, undermining trust in authorities, and criticizing” politicians perceived to be against Russia. This very brief statement omitted crucial details, such as how Russian tactics have shifted since 2016 and what the voters have to look out for. A belated update this month gave no new substance.
The entire primary came and went without any official word about Russian influence. Instead, press leaks became the means of sharing intelligence with the public. The result is a whirlwind of disputed storylines over basic matters such as which candidates Russia has supported. Earlier this year, reports indicated Moscow was aiding Trump, based on some anonymous accounts of a closed intelligence briefing. The White House pushed back, citing contrary secret briefings. Another round of stories suggested initial reports had overstated the intelligence about Russia helping Trump. Such accounts had also relied on unnamed sources with opaque agendas.
Intelligence leaders could have cleared things up for the public, but they called the matter classified. Congress spent months looking for answers. Average citizens still have no way to sort out conflicting assertions and must simply await the next leak. This game of telephone cannot be the American system of educating citizens about threats to our democracy. Voters deserve authoritative assessments from intelligence officials.
The standard rationale for keeping intelligence under wraps is to protect sensitive sources. But it is possible to share conclusions without exposing the evidence. Indeed, the intelligence community had released a lengthy assessment of Russian influence efforts in the 2016 election. While it was sanitized, it answered important questions. What did Russia do? How and why did Russia do it? Who ordered it? It still remains a gold standard.
The biggest limitation of the report was its timing. With the 2016 election already decided, American voters had no opportunity to respond. That is why a bipartisan Senate panel recently urged that “the public should be informed as soon as possible” of any foreign influence campaign for the 2020 election. The federal government adopted a process for this, but it never actually used it. Why not? I know from experience that intelligence agencies are profoundly resistant to communication with the public.
Secrecy is ingrained. Analysts write only for their “customers” with proper clearances and a need to know. The spy agencies have grown particularly reticent under this administration, fearing any disclosures that may draw ire from Trump. But these are not adequate justifications for withholding critical information from the public. Citizens have been conscripted into modern information warfare, so national defense depends partly on how well the public understands this battlefield. The American people should be considered intelligence customers with an urgent need to know.

Public release of intelligence is always delicate. A botched rollout in the middle of the campaign season could become its own form of election interference. Recrimination lingers from the FBI involvement in the 2016 election, and there is a legitimate fear of a political intelligence process. Careless disclosures might also sow undue panic over foreign influence, accidentally helping adversaries delegitimize the election results.
But responsible transparency is better than shrouded secrecy. Leaks and distortions proliferate and often drown out truthful information. A timely public record would end these games and make the federal government more accountable for addressing election influence, a signature threat of our era. Voters deserve facts on active foreign efforts to manipulate them. With the election just months away, there is no more time to waste.

0,07/25/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/509002-more-willful-blindness-by-the-media-on-spying-by-obama-administration,More willful blindness by the media on spying by Obama administration,"The Washington press corps seems engaged in a collective demonstration of the legal concept of willful blindness, or deliberately ignoring the facts, following the release of yet another declassified document which directly refutes prior statements about the investigation into Russia collusion. The document shows that FBI officials used a national security briefing of then candidate Donald Trump
and his top aides to gather possible evidence for Crossfire Hurricane, its code name for the Russia investigation.
It is astonishing that the media refuses to see what is one of the biggest stories in decades. The Obama administration targeted the campaign of the opposing party based on false evidence. The media covered Obama administration officials ridiculing the suggestions of spying on the Trump campaign and of improper conduct with the Russia investigation. When Attorney General William Barr told the Senate last year that he believed spying did occur, he was lambasted in the media, including by James Comey and others involved in that investigation. The mocking “wow” response of the fired FBI director received extensive coverage.
The new document shows that, in summer 2016, FBI agent Joe Pientka briefed Trump campaign advisers Michael Flynn and Chris Christie over national security issues, standard practice ahead of the election. It had a discussion of Russian interference. But this was different. The document detailing the questions asked by Trump and his aides and their reactions was filed several days after that meeting under Crossfire Hurricane and Crossfire Razor, the FBI investigation of Flynn. The two FBI officials listed who approved the report are Kevin Clinesmith and Peter Strzok.
Clinesmith is the former FBI lawyer responsible for the FISA surveillance conducted on members of the Trump campaign. He opposed Trump and sent an email after the election declaring “viva the resistance.” He is now under review for possible criminal charges for altering a FISA court filing. The FBI used Trump adviser Carter Page as the basis for the original FISA application, due to his contacts with Russians. After that surveillance was approved, however, federal officials discredited the collusion allegations and noted that Page was a CIA asset. Clinesmith had allegedly changed the information to state that Page was not working for the CIA.
Strzok is the FBI agent whose violation of FBI rules led Justice Department officials to refer him for possible criminal charges. Strzok did not hide his intense loathing of Trump and famously referenced an “insurance policy” if Trump were to win the election. After FBI officials concluded there was no evidence of any crime by Flynn at the end of 2016, Strzok prevented the closing of the investigation as FBI officials searched for any crime that might be used to charge the incoming national security adviser.
Documents show Comey briefed President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden on the investigation shortly before the inauguration of Trump. When Comey admitted the communications between Flynn and Russian officials appeared legitimate, Biden reportedly suggested using the Logan Act, a law widely seen as unconstitutional and never been used to successfully convict a single person, as an alternative charge against Flynn. The memo contradicts eventual claims by Biden that he did not know about the Flynn investigation. Let us detail some proven but mostly unseen facts.
First, the Russia collusion allegations were based in large  part on the dossier funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The Clinton campaign repeatedly denied paying for the dossier until after the election, when it was confronted with irrefutable evidence that the money had been buried among legal expenditures. As New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wrote, “Folks involved in funding this lied about it and with sanctimony for a year.”
Second, FBI agents had warned that dossier author Christopher Steele may have been used by Russian intelligence to plant false information to disrupt the election. His source for the most serious allegations claims that Steele misrepresented what he had said and that it was little more than rumors that were recast by Steele as reliable intelligence.
Third, the Obama administration had been told that the basis for the FISA application was dubious and likely false. Yet it continued the investigation, and then someone leaked its existence to the media. Another declassified document shows that, after the New York Times ran a leaked story on the investigation, even Strzok had balked at the account as misleading and inaccurate. His early 2017 memo affirmed that there was no evidence of any individuals in contact with Russians. This information came as the collusion stories were turning into a frenzy that would last years.
Fourth, the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller and inspectors general found no evidence of collusion or knowing contact between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. What inspectors general did find were false statements or possible criminal conduct by Comey and others. While unable to say it was the reason for their decisions, they also found statements of animus against Trump and his campaign by the FBI officials who were leading the investigation. Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testified he never would have approved renewal of the FISA surveillance and encouraged further investigation into such bias.

Finally, Obama and Biden were aware of the investigation, as were the administration officials who publicly ridiculed Trump when he said there was spying on his campaign. Others, like House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, declared they had evidence of collusion but never produced it. Countless reporters, columnists, and analysts still continue to deride, as writer Max Boot said it, the spinning of “absurd conspiracy theories” about how the FBI “supposedly spied on the Trump campaign.”
Willful blindness has its advantages. The media covered the original leak and the collusion narrative, despite mounting evidence that it was false. They filled hours of cable news shows and pages of print with a collusion story discredited by the FBI. Virtually none of these journalists or experts have acknowledged that the collusion leaks were proven false, let alone pursue the troubling implications of national security powers being used to target the political opponents of an administration. But in Washington, success often depends not on what you see but what you can unsee.

0,07/24/20 04:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/508928-america-has-to-be-ready-for-mail-voting-to-avert-an-election-crisis,America has to be ready for mail voting to avert an election crisis,"Valid concerns have been raised about mail voting. In New York, the local election boards have taken weeks to count primary ballots received in the mail as a result of the coronavirus, leaving several races for Congress still unresolved. The problems have been blamed on the late decision to send out the absentee ballot applications, outdated ballot counting machines, and the sheer number of mail ballots. The New York case raises a serious alarm with the 2020 election approaching and many states considering more reliance on mail voting in the midst of the pandemic.
Adding to this sense of urgency, President Trump
has declared, without evidence, that mail voting is an open invitation to fraud and will be used unfairly against him this fall. He has tweeted that mail voting would make this the “most rigged” election in history. Setting aside the fact that states have relied on absentee and mail voting to hold secure elections for many years, the stumbles in New York and the irresponsible fear mongering by Trump raise the potential of a very real crisis come this fall.
Consider the national disruption surrounding the 2000 election, which was decided for George Bush after a recount in Florida, a month of legal battles, and a controversial split Supreme Court decision. After you add the factor of a second wave of coronavirus cases in the fall and a sitting president shouting “rigged!” to the rafters, and you can understand why some analysts worry that the period following the 2020 election may be one of the most disruptive contests in our modern history.
A crisis foretold, however, can be a crisis averted. Instead of wringing our hands over the recent problems with mail voting in New York, we have to learn from them and from the multiple states that have implemented mail voting systems without problems or fraud. Then states can make common sense preparations to ensure the process goes as quickly and smoothly as possible to prevent a potential election crisis in November.
The fact that election boards were overwhelmed by an influx of absentee ballots in New York must be the rallying cry for dedicating more resources to efficiently implement mail voting systems. Reducing funds available for mail voting initiatives, as some Trump supporters have advocated, in this era when many people have to rely on these ballots or literally risk death, will only serve to suppress voting, which may be the point.
Consider the case of Ohio for a glimpse of what a proactive mail voting initiative looks like. At the urging of Governor Mike DeWine, Republican and Democratic lawmakers unanimously approved their all mail voting primary that was successfully concluded in April. Governors and state legislatures across the country have to learn from Ohio, and additional federal funds have to be made available to assist the efforts.
All those claims that mail ballots are subject to rampant tampering is not evidence that they are, and it suggests the need to educate voters on the issue. Members of the Armed Forces have relied on absentee voting with mail ballots since the Civil War. Trump himself has voted absentee by mail. Meanwhile, three states allow ounties to conduct elections completely by mail if they choose, five other states conduct elections almost entirely by mail, and more than two dozen other states permit their residents to cast absentee ballots by mail without having to provide a reason.
Over 250 million votes have been cast using mailed ballots since 2000, according to the Vote at Home Institute, and yet exhaustive analysis has identified only a tiny fraction of cases of fraud. None of those states that hold their elections almost entirely by mail has seen voter fraud scandals. The bipartisan group Vote Safe, chaired by former Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and former Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, notes that several studies have consistently proven that mail ballots are secure and do not advantage one political party over the other. The team rightly emphasizes that the goal of ensuring the safety of voters as they exercise their rights during a raging pandemic is not a partisan issue.

Whether we improve our voting systems or defund them, the use of mail ballots will inevitably be much greater in the 2020 election than in years past. We can prepare for this eventuality and find innovative ways to deal with the challenges that arise, or we can shift our gaze from another crisis foretold and suffer the major consequences come November.
Winston Churchill noted that democracy is the worst form of government, except for all other forms that have been tried. In the midst of a pandemic across the country that has already claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans, exercising our right to vote by mail instead of in person may also seem like the worst solution, except for all other options.

0,07/23/20 05:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/508687-democrats-are-now-the-riot-party,Democrats are now the riot party,"For almost two months, Portland has been under siege from antifa and other extremists. These troops of the left terrorize the downtown area every night. They with paramilitary precision. As organized anarchists, they deploy a wide array of less than lethal weapons to wound police, ranging from bats and bricks to lasers shot in the eyes of officers to permanently damage their sight. All of this is to further their goal to overturn our society and radically transform the country.
If the news media cared to tell the public the truth, it would have been a top story on nightly broadcasts for weeks. The antifa rioters even tried to break into and burn down a federal courthouse in the city. The campaign of intimidation and destruction is plainly domestic terrorism. But the one reason the siege on Portland has become a major news story is because the administration is trying to restore law and order to the beleaguered city, and Democrats hysterically oppose any such action.
President Trump
has rightly sent in federal reinforcements to Portland, while many Democrats have circled the wagons on behalf of anarchism. Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to federal agents deployed to Portland as storm troopers. Other members of her party have spoken of federal law enforcement officers as some sort of invading army unwelcome in urban centers. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, deep into his campaign to utterly ruin that city, declared that he would take Trump to court if any federal officers were deployed to address the surging violence there.
This reaction is stunningly reckless and cynical, even for Democrats in an important election year. But it is not in the least surprising as the wave of uprisings against the police have quickly become a political liability. What started as the resurrection of the Black Lives Matter movement has since morphed into a general mobilization of activists and marxists who seek to turn this country into a social justice utopia. They have to focus on Trump at the moment, or else more Americans might start to figure out what lunacy the left is inflicting on Portland, among other places.
One can argue about the politics of these mobs, but they are situated on the liberal side of the aisle. Indeed, they are part of the base of Joe Biden. Now that they have moved from outrage over the killing of George Floyd to revolutionary rage, the moral high ground is quickly crumbling under their feet. Why are the anarchists terrorizing Portland? What was the real purpose of the Seattle autonomous zone? Why were “Occupy City Hall” protesters allowed to fight with police in Manhattan for a month, until officers finally cleared out their encampment this week?
Their leaders might offer answers to these questions, but none of them are sensible or serious people who are working for what is best for this country. Defunding the police has become the primary rallying cry of these rioters, and we have already seen the effects of that insane idea. Without political support, the police hold back from the most proactive approaches to stop violent crime. That means more shootings and more deaths occurring in largely minority neighborhoods.
The administration is right to step in and send federal officers to defend the lives and property of Americans. They have been left by Democratic mayors and governors to fend for themselves. Trump is acting fully within his authority to remedy their dereliction of duty and use resources placed at his disposal. Federal law enforcement agencies are already operating in Portland and every city in the country. Many local police officers work side by side with their federal counterparts every day to handle crimes ranging from human trafficking to firearms sales and terrorism.

That leaders in Portland and other cities have chosen to sideline or stand down local police officers in order to pander to their enraged base has no bearing on the legality of federal police officers doing their jobs. That the entire focus of Democrats is on trashing Trump across the campaign trail instead of working with the sorely needed federal law enforcement assets should speak volumes to Americans about their priorities.
Portland is the most prominent battleground of this battle over federal intervention. Chicago could be next, then perhaps New York. Democrats have lost control of cities because they bowed to and allied themselves with the mob to help their party in a critical election year. Trump views this moment as his obligation to protect Americans and restore law and order to a country that still overwhelmingly desires both.

0,07/23/20 03:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/508725-congress-must-end-blank-check-to-use-on-government-farm-subsidies,Congress must end blank check to use on government farm subsidies,"Over the last two months, leading members of the agriculture committees in Congress have proposed using an obscure law, the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, to give the administration a permanent annual blank check of nearly $68 billion to spend on federal subsidies to farm businesses. The administration would be free to allocate the funds to programs that would not be developed or authorized by Congress.
This means any president could use the funds to benefit special interest groups for political purposes. From a public policy perspective, allowing any administration free rein to spend that much money on programs of its choice with little or no accountability to Congress is simply a bad idea. It also represents an abdication by Congress of its key policy and oversight duties as the legislative branch of the federal government.
Commodity Credit Corporation funds are sent to farm businesses through a wide range of farm bill programs authorized by Congress. These include crop subsidies triggered by low prices, payments to adopt soil and other natural resource conservation practices, promoting exports of crops from almonds to wheat, financing international aid shipments, providing relief assistance, and supporting agricultural and science research.
In normal times, Congress would likely not consider any proposal to raise the Commodity Credit Corporation cap, and certainly not to the level of nearly $68 billion. The current annual spending cap of $30 billion has been in effect since 1986. Since then the cap has only been exceeded once by a small amount. There is no reason for a permanent increase because of current and projected spending on farm bill programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that those federal subsidies will average less than $11 billion each year over the next decade.
Since 2018, the administration has exploited some of the discretionary provisions of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act to send an additional $28 billion to farm businesses as compensation for any losses they might have incurred because of the trade wars with China, Mexico, Canada, and other nations. Then with the Cares Act, Congress increased the cap by $14 billion to deal with the dire disruptions in the agricultural commodities market caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Over the past 40 years, administrations of both parties have rarely chosen to use excess Commodity Credit Corporation funds for their own political purposes. When they have, their initiatives have been limited in scope and subject to scrutiny by Congress. For instance, when President Obama had disbursed $350 million in emergency disaster assistance in 2010, some of the funds were specifically targeted for Arkansas rice producers, a move that many viewed as an attempt to help Senator Blanche Lincoln retain her seat in her unsuccessful campaign for the 2012 election.
Congress responded by inserting a provision in the appropriations bill for the following year that sharply curtailed the discretionary authority of the administration to use Commodity Credit Corporation funds for any more emergency payments. Those restrictions were retained through 2017 but were not included with subsequent appropriations bills. President Trump was then free to use his authority to compensate farmers to the tune of an additional $28 billion for any losses from all the trade wars.

Census Bureau confirms plans to end data collection early
Like the other industries that export, many farm businesses have been hit hard by the policy decisions of the administration and, more dramatically, by the coronavirus pandemic. However, giving permanent authority to the administration to send new federal handouts that are 200 percent larger for producers than those authorized by Congress is fiscally irresponsible and diminishes legislative and oversight responsibilities.
While this approach could be viewed as addressing urgent legitimate needs, it will likely lead to political subsidy initiatives in the future. With little or no accountability and oversight from Congress, such programs inevitably invite abuse. The initial $30 billion cap for Commodity Credit Corporation funds should be left in place or even lowered. Let Congress be the one to decide when circumstances warrant raising the cap, not when it is expedient for a current or future administration.

0,07/23/20 11:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/508662-latin-america-needs-economic-reforms-that-advance-business,Latin America needs economic reforms that advance business,"Latin America is entering one of the most difficult economic periods in its history with the coronavirus crisis exposing and exacerbating weaknesses in the regional market. The International Monetary Fund forecasts a major recession for many nations in Latin America, with a regional contraction of more than 9 percent and spiking unemployment. The path to recovery will be difficult, however, government leaders can take concrete steps now to lay the foundation for a robust journey toward economic growth.
Latin America and the United States must redouble efforts to facilitate and encourage private sector activity and foreign direct investment using free market reforms, while turning the area into an attractive alternative for the manufacturers with operations in China. The most important task for Latin America is to provide the critical fiscal and monetary support to shepherd the private sector through the worst of the downturn, such as sending key financing to businesses and facilitating a safe return to activity.
Governments should work to address issues that undermine businesses. The guiding standard for this effort should be the World Bank benchmark report. No country in Latin America made it to the top 50 of the ranking of favorable economic environments and legal frameworks. Weaknesses like corruption, complex taxation systems, barriers to the hiring and dismissal of employees, and bureaucratic red tape severely undermine the regional activity and entrepreneurship that drive an economic recovery.
Another opportunity for reforms is in the promotion of innovation in the economic downturn and enabling new startups and businesses to flourish and to diversify the regional market. Many countries in Latin America have placed legal and political barriers against disruptive innovation, as seen in the experience of Uber, but the benefits of new ideas are dramatic.
The technology startup Rappi has allowed Colombia to absorb millions of Venezuelan refugees by offering them as well as native citizens accessible employment with gig jobs. The app provides millions across Latin America safe access to food delivery while enabling thousands of small businesses to remain connected to their customers even during the pandemic.
Technology companies are key for the management of the coronavirus in Latin America, with regional startups boosting productivity through online platforms offering workers and students greater access to critical training and educational opportunities. The controversies and challenges over the integration of such startups into regional markets and the labor standards should be addressed, but this should not be a barrier to innovation.
Finally, as firms based in the United States look for alternatives to China amid rising political tensions, Latin America should work to attract supply chains to the Western Hemisphere. The United States should also work to increase regional ties so supply chains maintain stable trading partners in Latin America that offer distinct competitive economic advantages.
Trump Spanish-language ad equates progressives, socialists
Some countries in Latin America are more prepared than others to take these steps. The United States must be prepared to work more intensely with countries ready to take appropriate measures. It should leverage a combination of the private sector, development funds, and multilateral institutions. A great tool for such efforts is the America Crece initiative, which can be used to promote the infrastructure development vital for facilitating private sector activity and raising trade connectivity.
The barriers to business and entrepreneurship have been the subject of several reforms and lip service across Latin America, but the coronavirus crisis and the opportunity to attract new supply chains make addressing them an important priority to bolster the troubled regional private sector. Doing so now is essential to promoting economic stability and prosperity across the Western Hemisphere after the pandemic is finally over.

has stories to tell. As with any oral tradition, they echo in slightly different versions of the same theme, like how he would lift you up by calling you “my brother” and how he would modulate from a soft murmur to fire and brimstone. This is a story about him you have not heard from the time I spent with him in Congress.
In 2014, the production “All The Way” starring Bryan Cranston opened on broadway. The show depicts the cunning strategies of Lyndon Johnson to pass the Civil Rights Act during his first year as president. I asked Lewis if I could put together a fundraising lunch for him in Manhattan followed by a viewing of the play. My staff purchased tickets and asked if there was any way that Lewis, our guests, and I could meet the cast. We were informed later that several actors would be available after the performance.
We started out this special day in my New York district on Long Island. I took Lewis to an African American church in a town known as Glen Cove. When he spoke, the crowd fell into a quiet reverence and listened. As we left, parents nudged their children toward him. He refused to exit without hugging every kid who reached out to him. Then we drove to Manhattan, pulled into a parking garage, walked three blocks to the restaurant.
The usual short stroll took 20 minutes. There was the utility worker who bellowed “John Lewis!” as he emerged from a manhole and scrambled to shake hands with the lawmakers, couples from the suburbs who insisted on photos, and college students who peppered him with questions. At one point, I asked him whether we were in his district or near mine.
We finally made it to the Neil Simon Theater on West 52nd Street. As an usher led us to our seats as heads turned and fingers pointed to Lewis. I sat next to him during the performance, and heard him whisper on a few occasions or register his recognition with a soft laugh. The performance ended and the theater cleared. We waited for several actors to join us. I figured there would be the usual grip and grins and we would leave. But the entire cast came out, including Cranston, Michael McKean, Brandon Dirden, Betsy Aidem, and the actors who had so convincingly portrayed Hubert Humphrey, George Wallace, Richard Russell, and others.
After some photos, I asked if any of them could say a few words about the show. But one of the actors claimed, “We would actually love to hear from Congressman Lewis.” The actors became the audience, and Lewis became the star of a one man show. He reflected on the reality they portrayed. He shared stories that they absorbed for future performances. I noticed tears starting to fall down the faces of several of the actors. They continued to ask Lewis questions, which he answered as always, softly and patiently. At the end of the session, the cast gave him a great standing ovation.

We are a nation so divided that we are now fighting over the Civil War. We debate statues in a proxy argument over whether to embrace or repudiate the grave sins of the past. Our president is so out of touch on this critical issue that he has threatened to veto the spending bill of the Pentagon if it contains any bipartisan language mandating the removal of confederate names from military properties. This is almost like saying that he wants to “defund the soldiers” in order to preserve the legacy of racism.
Now may be a good time to erect statues of Lewis on Capitol Hill and in parks and public places. I served in the shadow of a living monument. A memorial marked not by graffiti but by the wounds inflicted by the bigots who beat him. A memorial that brought tears to broadway on that day six years ago and now as the nation says goodbye to him this week.

. Whether it was advocating for more worker protection or the freedom to marry, he was always at my side during my 30 years as a lobbyist. His lifetime of fighting for equal access to voting in our elections has become the core mission of my job. I am dedicated to carrying on his legacy on voting rights. I will miss having him by my side and hearing his voice. He will remain one of the most remarkable men I have ever met.
I first got to know Congressman Lewis as a new lobbyist in Washington for the Association of Flight Attendants. My first major battle was against the tobacco industry. The flight attendants were sick and dying from working in airplanes filled with smoke. I was fighting for their health and the health of the travelers. Back then, the tobacco industry was dominant in Georgia, and Lewis did not vote with the union. We reminisced decades later about how difficult this battle was, long after the airplane smoking ban passed.
Congressman Lewis always graciously accepted my invitations to speak to my children and their friends. He would drive to the elementary school of my son in Maryland. He walked into the auditorium where the kids sat in a circle on the hard wooden floor then kneeled down to be eye to eye with the kids. For almost an hour, he stayed in that position talking to the kids about his life experiences and the power of the civil rights movement. He answered questions and was totally engaged with the enthralled group of children. I was also amazed by his flexibility once he stood back up again.
In another special encounter, he stopped briefly on Capitol Hill as former Representative Tammy Baldwin was escorting some folks from Rainbow Families. It was a Saturday morning, and the building was quiet. Despite his casual attire, he never missed the chance to be in touch with young people. He stopped and talked about the civil rights movement and his legislation. He talked about Bloody Sunday and about being attacked on Edmund Pettus Bridge. He silenced the distracted kids with his stories, passion, and commitment, urging them to join him in fighting for civil rights. He made them laugh by telling them to get into good trouble.
He was there for me as I fought for the freedom to marry. He accepted a request to film a video for the freedom to marry. Along with the film crew, we listened as he described the amazing pictures in his office showing the incredible moments of his life. It was the first time I got to hear him tell the story about preaching to chickens. His passion for fighting for people was present in each special encounter that I was privileged to have with him.
The last time I had a chance to see Congressman Lewis in person was at a press conference the day the Voting Rights Advancement Act was being voted on in the House late last year. It was shortly before he announced he had cancer. He spoke, as always, with passion and brilliance. Several people circled around him after to shake his hand. He was gracious and loving to everyone who wanted to speak to him. Later that day, he would hold the gavel to announce the passage of the bill. I was moved to tears when I saw him on television at the Black Lives Matter Plaza last month.

Trump says Lewis made 'big mistake' by not coming to his inauguration
It is time to honor his memory by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will secure democracy and ensure that all Americans have the ability to participate in our elections. The bill would overturn the damage done by the Supreme Court decision in Shelby County versus Eric Holder, which gutted the Voting Rights Act. The ruling stopped years of progress for access to the ballot box. It has led to legal roadblocks. States passed felony disenfranchisement laws, mandated restrictive voter identification laws, and closed polling locations in many black and brown communities.
As Congressman Lewis famously declared, “We must use our time and our space on this little planet that we call earth to make a lasting contribution to leave it a little better than we found it.” Fighting for the passage of the Voting Rights Advancement Act would carry on his great legacy as a civil rights leader. We can and must do it for him and the future of our country.

0,07/20/20 11:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/508070-republican-governors-are-failing-with-their-coronavirus-responses,Republican governors are failing with their coronavirus responses,"Republican governors were initially seen as strong leaders for reopening their economies but are utterly failing to reduce the rising coronavirus transmissions in their states. Considering the growing number of cases and deaths, several Republican governors, such as Kay Ivey of Alabama, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Greg Abbott of Texas have redirected their efforts toward issuing mask mandates to curb transmissions.
But Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of my home state of Georgia, has been brazenly defying scientific data showing that masks can reduce the spread of the coronavirus by overriding more than a dozen local mask mandates and even suing the capital of Atlanta. His actions conflict with the cherished conservative government principle of local control.
Under President Obama, Republican state lawmakers regularly accused the federal government of adopting a broad “one size fits all” mentality and of subverting the rightful authority of states. Kemp is eroding this core Republican value with his actions against local municipalities. His lawsuit against Atlanta targets Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and not the many national chains across the city, like Walmart, Kroger, and Publix, which have all mandated masks for both employees and patrons.
The simple fact is that many Republican leaders have been devoid of any core party principles on this and many other issues. They squawk about local control yet will ruthlessly decimate the authority of cities to write their own destinies when it suits them. According to the Georgia Health Department data, more than 131,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus, and more than 3,100 people have died from it in the state. More than one million tests have been administered in the state.
Further, the coronavirus pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority groups, with high rates of death in African American, Native American, and Latino communities. Notably, a majority of the cities in Georgia that have mask mandates are predominately African American. In the era of Black Lives Matter, overriding these local mandates is almost analogous to allowing police brutality against African Americans.

Instead of taking cues from other Republican governors, Kemp wastes taxpayer money by jet setting across states. However, some businesses are supporting him. The director of the Georgia Restaurant Association believes that a mask mandate is not appropriate considering the size and diversity of the state. But she notes that businesses must still make their own decisions about requiring customers to wear masks. Kemp might be trying to appease his base or keep the support of businesses.
Indeed, Kemp is cut from the same cloth of President Trump. Nationalism and white grievances have engulfed Republicans and, unfortunately, they are willing to continue to risk lives to promote their inward agenda. When viewed in that context, the decision of Kemp to stop cities and counties from instituting mask mandates makes perfect sense. From the very start of the pandemic, Kemp has operated with moral incompetence and has placed politics above public health in this major crisis. His latest decision of a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta is just more of the same.

0,07/19/20 07:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/508041-why-steve-bannon-would-fuel-donald-trump-toward-victory,Why Steve Bannon would fuel Donald Trump toward victory,"“The Trump campaign is dead.” “Voters are getting tired of his outrageous statements.” “Joe Biden has an insurmountable lead.” The 2020 narrative is like 2016 all over again. But there is a significant difference between then and now, and it is that Donald Trump
no longer has Steve Bannon
.
Think back to the lowest point of the 2016 Trump campaign. One month before the election, the Access Hollywood tape was leaked to the press in that blow to the Republican candidate. Any traditional campaign manager would have advised Trump to issue an apology and grovel before a hostile media. But Bannon instructed Trump to stand his ground. He knew that far more important than innuendo and “locker room talk” in an old tape was a fundamental understanding of the mindset and needs of the voters.
As chief executive officer of the 2016 Trump campaign, Bannon captured lightning in a bottle. For a 2020 Trump campaign beset by leaks, appeals to ungettable voters, and the damage from the coronavirus, only Bannon can bring in the missing spark. It might be hard to catch lightning twice, but the president cannot afford to leave out the only person of his first campaign who pulled off an unprecedented win four years ago.
Since the days of the second George Bush, several Republican candidates would react to media trends and allow Candy Crowley moments to define their campaigns. The time that Bannon had spent at Breitbart gave him a unique perspective on how to drive the national debate instead of simply responding to narratives set forth by legacy media outlets.
Bannon neutralized criticisms of Trump, while hitting a crucial weakness of the opposition, by parading the sexual assault accusers of Bill Clinton into a room full of mainstream reporters for a surprise panel just before the second debate. This move forced the press to cover his checkered past with women and marked a tremendous turnaround on the ground just two days after the Access Hollywood tape was released.
Consider the current media landscape, which forces Trump to respond to claims that American society is racist and to coverage about coronavirus cases exploding in red states. While Trump struggles to find his message, it is Bannon who has the finger on those issues most important to Trump voters. Listen to his War Room podcast for a better idea of what the 2020 Republican bid must talk about. Bannon knows the threat from China and the loss of American jobs. Instead of Trump fighting the culture war over race, or arguing about masks, he should take control of the narrative and speak to the blue collar workers who sent him to victory.
When several Republican candidates tried to win with outreach to young and Latino voters, including in 2008 and 2012, Bannon knew the Rust Belt held the key to victory for Trump, whose odds fell to below 20 percent a month before the election, according to political forecasters. Rather than spending valuable time apologizing, Trump engaged in a spectacular blitz of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. Each of these states had not been carried by a Republican candidate in years.
Unfortunately, the Trump team today does not seem to understand any of this. Demoting Brad Parscale for the establishment campaign experience of Bill Stepien is a lateral move. The 2000 Karl Rove playbook will not work for this election. Many of those closest to Trump in the White House and the campaign are not actual Republicans or even populists. The outreach of the First Step Act did not build the support from the black community that was expected, with Trump behind 80 percent to 6 percent among African American voters, according to a Wall Street Journal poll.

Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks
Many of those surrounding the president and the campaign may be loyal to Donald Trump the man but not Donald Trump the idea. There is little that their advice or appearances in campaign stops offer the president. Removing the true nature of the president will likely doom his odds of a second term. Right now, Trump seems like he is tired from fighting. He is down 8 points in the Real Clear Politics average. Some of his confidants are reportedly pushing him for left wing sops on the police and criminal justice reform. It is as if they learned nothing from the last time.
Trump can win. Bannon knew that the moment when he joined the 2016 campaign, and he refused to follow the schematics of Beltway insiders. Instead, Bannon sparked an insurgent approach to an outsider campaign. Even Trump himself has said that he was surprised by his November win. Bannon was not. If Trump wants to stay president, he has one of the two pieces needed for a victory this year. Pair Conway with Bannon and you will see Trump in vintage form with 270 electoral votes or more.

abruptly demoted campaign manager Brad Parscale last week and announced that deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien would replace him. This sudden shakeup, taking place only a few months away from the election, indicates that Trump is in trouble. Faced with falling numbers and the disappointing Tulsa rally turnout, his campaign is now struggling to develop and communicate a unifying message.
Regardless of who is leading the effort to win a second term for Trump, his campaign will need to make a case to voters that centers on a message of inclusion, a plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and a strategy that will help workers and businesses recover from the financial downturn. By almost every indication, Trump has reason to be worried. Joe Biden leads by eight points in national polls, according to Real Clear Politics.
It is clear that Trump needs a substantial shift in strategy to win, but he regularly ignores advisers and veers off message. It is unclear how much more effective Stepien will be at refocusing the campaign compared to Parscale. But Trump is certainly no stranger to staff turnover, both in his administration and in his campaign, as we have seen before.
His 2016 campaign experienced many changes at the top, from Corey Lewandowski to Paul Manafort to Kellyanne Conway to Steve Bannon. However, the position of Trump after serving one tumultuous term is dramatically different from four years ago when he ran as an insurgent candidate. The president and his campaign, however, are struggling to develop and communicate a convincing message to voters.
Moreover, in the midst of a pandemic and a racial justice movement on par with that of the 1960s, there is a message of conciliation that Trump eschews. This is reflected in his weak polling position and declining job approval ratings. Only 41 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing, while 56 percent disapprove, according to Real Clear Politics. In the end, the shakeup will probably not make a difference.
During the Tulsa rally, Trump spoke for almost two hours to a smaller than expected crowd. He struggled to offer a convincing and positive platform. Instead, Trump used the opportunity to pander to his base and speak off the cuff, concerningly claiming that he told officials in his administration to slow down coronavirus testing, even while the pandemic continues to take an increasingly deadly toll across the United States.
Ultimately, it is worth noting that another key element of his strategy will be making the election a major choice between him and Biden, and not a referendum on his leadership, which is what Biden and the Democrats are doing with some success. In addition to going negative on Biden, this will also require Trump to develop a positive message for his candidacy that can contrast with the platform of Biden and the Democrats.
Trump attempted to do so without success in a dark and divisive speech last week. He warned that Biden and the Democrats want to destroy the suburbs, a clear attempt to sway white voters, a group that Trump won in 2016 but has now defected, while also stoking racial divisions.

To be sure, the vast majority of Americans agree with Trump on the need for law and order, as he and Richard Nixon put it. Most voters agree with the absurdity of defunding the police. However, if Trump simply asserts that Biden somehow supports insurrection and such defunding efforts, that is not credible and ultimately does not assist his candidacy.
With only a few months until the election, it is still possible for Trump to be more inclusive and conciliatory. But without a positive message that finds common ground for a deeply divided country, he will not be able to maximize support, regardless of who is managing his campaign.

0,07/18/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/507941-how-real-is-reverse-discrimination,How real is reverse discrimination?,"In 1976, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall lambasted the “illogic” of civil rights advocates insisting that laws against discrimination should protect only minorities from discrimination. The first African American justice and civil rights litigator declared that whites also deserved such protections. Today, as bizarre as it may seem, he could be denounced as enabling claims of “reverse discrimination.” Yet this debate could find its way back to the Supreme Court, given the array of controversies over the use of race as a threshold criteria for benefits or penalties.
The Black Lives Matter movement was premised on the need to recognize the inequities and abuse of African Americans exclusively, rather than a broader position that “all lives matter.” The protests have convinced many of us about the importance of that recognition. But cities and states are turning to reforms where that racial exclusivity presents a potentially insurmountable barrier. Relying on threshold exclusions of all but one or two races could rekindle the debate over “reverse discrimination” and what constitutes discrimination versus affirmative action.
Marshall is an interesting figure at the crossroads of that debate. While ruling that whites are protected from racial discrimination under laws like Title VII, he supported affirmative action and dissented from the 1978 decision in the Allan Bakke case to reject reverse discrimination claims. He maintained that there was much to be done to correct the continuing depravations of racism since the Supreme Court “did not prohibit the most ingenious and pervasive forms of discrimination” against blacks. He stated, “I cannot believe that this same Constitution stands as a barrier.”
The question is where to draw that line and if “reverse discrimination” is real. That issue came up when Gary Garrels, a senior curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, resigned after he was denounced as a racist. The reason? While supporting diversity of the artists exhibited in the famed collection, Garrels said, “We will definitely still continue to collect white artists.” He reportedly also said a ban on acquiring art from white artists would be “reverse discrimination.” A petition calling for his firing said the terms “reverse discrimination” and “reverse racism” are offensive forms of “white supremacist and racist language.”
This instance highlights the limitations and the lingering debate over such distinctions. His colleagues had every right to express their views of his comments, and his decision to resign was a private decision. However, his objection to the use of race as an exclusive criteria to be in the collection captured the uncertainty between discrimination and diversification, a line that has occupied the Supreme Court for decades without a clear resolution in college admissions and other areas.
One possible case may arise in Seattle, where city council members have called to cut the police budget by 50 percent. Doing so would require firing a significant number of police officers, which is also popular. But that puts the city council in a quandary, as firing half of the department would start with the most junior officers, many of whom are minorities. Thus, defunding the police in the name of racial justice would lead to firing minority officers. One simple solution, according to city council member Lisa Herbold, is to fire the white officers.
Her proposal is striking in both its illegality and its popularity. In his 1976 opinion in the Santa Fe Trail Transportation Company case, Marshall ruled for two white employees fired after a theft. While a black employee also was held responsible, only the two white employees were fired. Marshall said that discriminating against them made a mockery of laws against discrimination. In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled against New Haven after white firefighters and a Hispanic firefighter challenged the city when it refused to certify results of promotion exams in order to promote black firefighters who did not perform as well. The Supreme Court held that the refusal to certify was unlawful discrimination.
While the Supreme Court has allowed race to be considered as a factor in some college admissions cases, it has struck down certain programs that crossed the line into discrimination. The position of many of the justices on this is summed up by Chief Justice John Roberts in a landmark 2007 decision in which he wrote, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminaton on the basis of race.”
Of course, what is discrimination to some is affirmative action to others. The California Faculty Association has called for a wide array of reforms, including “free tuition for all Black, Native, and Indigenous students.” The California legislature is moving to undo “reverse discrimination” rules, and state senators voted to approve a ballot measure for the election this fall revoking Proposition 209, the 1996 state amendment banning any consideration of race or ethnicity in admissions decisions at public universities. Governor Gavin Newsom supports that revocation.
The California proposals could present another array of challenges over what are benefits to particular insular groups and what are penalties for those excluded. It is easier to benefit an insular group than it is to penalize other groups based on race. That line can become murky. Past cases have argued that state funds work as a zero sum game, where the increase of funds from one purpose means the reduction of available funds for other purposes. If the proposal is adopted to give free tuition for minority students, the loss of revenue would be considerable for state schools.

As the nation moves toward concrete reforms, these criteria will have to be addressed in the courts. The exclusive reference to one or two racial groups will be met with judicial suspicion under governing case law. That is why we need a civil debate not over whether to implement reforms but how to do so. It cannot happen if concerns raised by people like Garrels are denounced as dog whistles or white supremacy.
The translation of this important social movement into needed legislative reforms will not be easy if it relies on threshold benefits or penalties based on a single classification or exclusion. We must have that discussion now so we do not waste years in unsuccessful litigation instead of using our energy to forge something that passes constitutional muster.

0,07/17/20 04:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/507853-why-america-has-to-avoid-amnesty,Why America has to avoid amnesty,"Make no mistake, any legal status conferred on any illegal immigrant in the United States is amnesty, which should be rejected by Americans. Amnesty, or the forgiveness of consequences for illegal immigration, undermines the rule of law and fuels unlawful migration.
We learned this lesson from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 when over three million illegal residents gained amnesty while the promises for increased border security remain unfulfilled. The debate is now about what to do with the more than 649,000 illegal residents who were granted relief from removal under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive action by President Obama in 2012.
President Trump
promised to end the program but has faced obstruction. The Supreme Court ruled last month that the way the administration went about ending the program did not comply with procedural requirements. Yet the decision held that it could end the program if those problems are solved. In other words, the administration is in the red zone. You do not punt in the red zone. You punch it in for the touchdown.
It is in this context that open border advocates want Trump to cave and grant amnesty in exchange for some concessions. But as we learned in 1986, that is not a deal that conservatives should take. Amnesty of any kind increases the incentives for illegal crossings and makes the task of border security much more difficult. Indeed, the initial announcement of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by Obama precipitated a massive increase in border crossings by unaccompanied minors.
Conservatives have pushed back amnesty efforts before, and we will do it again to protect. In 2013, more than a dozen Republican senators signed a comprehensive immigration package that included amnesty, among other unacceptable immigration giveaways. Conservatives across the country were rightfully outraged. They were betrayed and they took action. New conservative leaders emerged to beat back the effort, and the House did not take up the legislation. Conservatives held the people who pushed for amnesty accountable, and they continue to do so today.
The problem cannot be blamed on conservatives. For all of the emotional blackmail from liberals, the blame lies with them. Despite acknowledging that only Congress has the power to grant amnesty, Obama chose to do it anyway, giving hundreds of thousands of illegal residents the renewable permits to stay in the country. Obama falsely assured the recipients that their presence was legal and that they will not be removed.
Major corporations, progressive politicians, and open border advocates have sought to undermine our immigration system at every turn because doing so rewards them with cheap labor and more votes. Many of these same forces are at work to sow civil unrest in our cities. They rejoice that riots remain unaddressed by the criminal justice system. The common denominator in these cases is destruction of the rule of law.
There is nothing to be gained from empowering this mob. We should not negotiate with mobs in this country. Democrats have marketed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals in a winsome way, but its consequences are a significant loss for Americans. They have convinced large swaths of the public that the recipients under the program are special citizens whose virtues exceed that of actual citizens. Just look no further than Joe Biden saying that they are “more American than most Americans.”
Police committed 125 human rights violations during Floyd protests:...
Liberals speak of the recipients as if they are kids, but these people are overwhelmingly adults. They said the recipients were thoroughly vetted, but Obama officials rushed through applications without serious checks. They claim that the recipients have assimilated into the mainstream, but we know that many have not. Most importantly, liberals have made the debate about the quality and virtue of the recipients, when this is about the rule of law and the legitimacy of our immigration system.
The recipients deserve fair treatment and due consideration. But they should go through the same process that we ask of other immigrants. Trump ran on a platform of ending illegal immigration. He was right to recognize the awful impacts of this problem on our security, economy, rule of law, and cultural cohesion. Conservatives rewarded him with the White House, and conservatives were rewarded with a leader who has delivered his promises and achieved many victories. Conservatives will reward him again if he cancels this program once and for all.

None of us were alive for the even more controversial 1876 election. The results were unresolved for months until Congress declared Rutherford Hayes the winner only days before the inauguration.
We all hope this year ends up nothing like either of those precedents. But there is an increasing chance that the results of the 2020 election could remain uncertain for weeks because of delays in counting mailed ballots in the midst of the coronavirus. What can our leaders in the government do now to avoid a bad repeat of those calamitous precedents?
One answer is to say the prayer of election administrators that the results are a landslide. If the early returns are so lopsided that uncounted ballots will not make a difference in the end, the networks may be able to call an unofficial winner that night. However, realism forces us to recognize that the race could be close enough with the volume of uncounted ballots to prevent a typical Election Day call, with the race going into overtime. At that point the prayer for a landslide fails. What happens then?
In this regard, it is worth comparing the 1884 election and 1916 election, on the one hand, with the 1876 election and 2000 election, on the other. No one thinks of 1884 and 1916 as years when the election for president was disputed, and that is the critical point. In both years, however, the results remained unsettled for two weeks, yet the losing side ultimately accepted the final count to be the official choice of the people.
In each of those earlier election overtimes, both campaigns fielded teams of lawyers to inspect the ballots in battleground states. The 1884 election turned on New York, and the 1916 election turned on California. Moreover, Republicans were concerned in both times that fraud might deprive their candidate of a rightful victory. But after subjecting the returns to intense scrutiny, Republicans acknowledged that the Democratic candidate had won enough valid votes to prevail as the winner for president.
If this year is like 1884 and 1916, we should all be grateful. It would mean that the defeated party accepts the results as the verdict of the people, giving the winner the mantle of legitimacy. By contrast, 1876 and 2000 were problematic because the losing candidate conceded only that the decision maker, for instance the Electoral Commission or the Supreme Court, rendered a ruling and not that it spoke for the people.
How can we improve the odds that any overtime this year ends like 1884 and 1916 instead of 1876 and 2000? It starts with a commitment to state procedures that certify vote counts, several weeks after Election Day, as genuinely reflecting the decision by the eligible voters who participate. These procedures permit candidates to challenge questionable ballots. Candidates should use these state procedures with whatever evidence they have. No candidate should condemn an entire category of ballots, which is permissible under state laws, as inherently unreliable.
If there are concerns about details of ballot review procedures in certain states, the campaigns should raise them now. The American Law Institute looked at this topic and, with the input of recount lawyers from the major parties, developed a bipartisan set of principles that I worked on to guide reform. For any revision of these state laws over the next few months, the principles provide an important source. The campaigns should otherwise accept existing state laws and be prepared to honor the results.
If it is too much of a pipedream to expect the candidates for president this year to credit any adverse tallies when certified, then Congress had better start preparing for. Contestation over results certified by the states could extend overtime into January, when Congress will meet in joint session to receive the votes from the states. There are two ways in which the rules in Congress for this are deficient and worth redressing in advance.

Census Bureau confirms plans to end data collection early
The first issue is the calendar established by Congress. It requires states to hold their Electoral College meetings in December and to complete all the ballot review procedures six days earlier if they want the “safe harbor” promise by Congress to abide by such certified results. These deadlines proved to be challenging for Florida in 2000, and might be even harder this year with counting delays in the midst of the coronavirus. Congress should give states until early January to resolve controversies.
The second issue is the statute governing the joint session of Congress. Its convoluted language seems to require that, if Congress receives two conflicting submissions from a state, the results signed by the governor prevail unless both chambers of Congress agree otherwise. However, the statute is sufficiently ambiguous that Congress should clarify, in modern language, that interpretation of the tiebreaker by the governor is indeed correct. If Congress makes these two critical changes before November, then that would be much better than simply relying on prayer.

I am not talking about the slang definition of “liberal” but the historic consensus by those on the center left and the center right around fundamental values such as freedom of speech, independent judges, government ethics, and support for the rule of law around the world. The election was held in Poland, and friends of those democratic values have reason to be concerned.
President Duda, an ally of Donald Trump, won 51 percent of the vote in the runoff election against centrist Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Duda ran his campaign based on fear, which seems to be the powerful motivator of voters at this time. Fear of Jews. Fear of gays. Fear of foreigners.
It is part of a trend of ugly authoritarianism. From President Duterte in the Philippines to President Trump
in the United States, populist leaders have been stoking fear to rip people away from accepted norms. Trump attacks judges and journalists. President Erdogan of Turkey imprisons judges and journalists. Duterte deploys extrajudicial killings of his citizens.
In Poland, the supporters of Dude alleged that his opponent Trzaskowski was backed by “shadowy foreign forces” and took “money from Poles and disbursed it to Jewish interests.” Duda has described gay and transgender rights as an ideology worse than Soviet era communism, and proposed to prohibit same sex couples from adopting children with the law.
The race was closely watched as an indicator of the health of democratic liberalism. Trump did his part by meeting Duda at the White House before the election and praised him. Supporters of democratic norms take solace in how close the election was. Opponents only shrug their shoulders and promise that Duda will double down on his efforts to rein in the judiciary and expel unfriendly media outlets until his term expires in 2023.
Democratic illiberalism marches on, crushing what remains of the center left and the center right. In Germany, the far right Alternative for Germany is now the third largest party in the Bundestag, despite trying to dress up fidelity to Nazi principles in appropriate garb. Hungarian President Viktor Orban peddles his antisemitic tropes across billboards and media outlets. Count on the list Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, as well as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
So the question is why? Why have Europe, Latin America, the Philippines, and the United States provided such fertile soil for demagogues to till? I think this is a collective response to three fairly recent events that shook public confidence in the norms. These are the September 11 attacks, the flood of refugees triggered by the war in Syria, and the 2008 economic meltdown. Each challenged our senses of comfort and security, ignited anxiety, and could very easily be exploited by fear mongers.

The Polish election coincides with the release of “Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism” by Anne Applebaum. In the book, she explores how people who used to be dependable allies of democratic norms drift to illiberalism and take their countries with them. It is a good companion to “Road To Unfreedom” by Timothy Snyder and “Fascism: A Warning” by Madeleine Albright. When many bookshelves start to crowd with the same theme, something is happening in society.
Time will tell whether the pendulum swings back or catapults forward. By time, I mean less than four months from now, when Americans cast their votes in the election this year. The choice will be no different than those offered in other countries that are now losing their democratic character. Our decision will decide whether the world retains its liberal democratic norms or shifts to be something much darker and different.

. Should he stay in his basement and let the botched national coronavirus response of President Trump speak for itself, or should Biden mount an aggressive offense against his opponent, as James Carville has suggested and talk about what a “massive fat failure” he is?
One tool that campaigns have used in the past to lessen perceived risks associated with a candidate, or to compensate for apparent weaknesses, is to select a running mate who brings balance to the public image of the ticket. But research suggests that balancing act is much more fraught for a woman candidate as vice president in a country with as complicated a history with gender and political power as the United States.
The political landscape is a profoundly gendered space, especially at the White House level. Campaigning as a woman comes with roles, traps, and expectations that a male choice for vice president does not have to worry about. Given our track record in this country of holding female politicians to unfair double standards, Biden might have made the task of defeating Trump even tougher by doing what many Democrats consider to be the right thing in promising to select a woman as his running mate.
In the case of Biden, it is pretty clear what attributes need balancing and which do not. His direct knowledge of policy and how the machinery of government works, and the value which he places on expert advice, are welcomed departures from the haphazard style of leadership that Trump regularly exhibits. The weaknesses of Biden are his age and his tendency to embarrass himself or offend voters as he thinks on his feet.
His best decision for a running mate would be someone who is a much more nimble and energetic political attack dog than he is, and who also has government experience that reassures Americans that the person a heartbeat away from the presidency is up to the job. At first glance, the women on his short list for vice president, such as Susan Rice, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, seem to fill both the criteria well.
Including a woman on the Democratic ticket also brings other important benefits. The possibility of a woman vice president is notably meaningful in the United States, where we often tell young girls that their hopes and ambitions are limitless yet cannot point to a single instance in our history when a woman occupied the first or second highest government office in the land. This is not the case in other Western democracies.
What we have learned from decades of research on gender and politics, and from recent history, suggests a more complex picture. Women are unevenly punished when they assert themselves or display aggression, something that seems fundamental to the task of defending Biden and campaigning against Trump. Hillary Clinton has since spoken at length how her gender was a constant consideration with her 2008 and 2016 campaigns, translating to more hours spent preparing and dissecting strategies, such as how much humility and emotion to show.
The tightrope that women candidates must walk is even more tedious for African American women, who must contend with racist stereotypes that further constrain their attempts to gain traction with voters and support for their policy messages. As political science professor Wendy Smooth writes, African American women candidates, who are often considered left of center, face the dual pressures of offering “crossover appeal” for white voters while staying connected to communities of color.
Research showing that many of these effects seem to be muted by party members in a general election, as well as my own research on celebrities seeking office, may seem comforting in this case for Biden, as does much considerable literature that concludes most candidates for vice president have little to no impact on the way voters pick the president.
Trump campaign manager: We want more debates against Biden, and sooner
Trump: Election results could be delayed by months
But in this election, with Biden possibly not seeking a second term, voters are more likely to apply the standard for the president to the candidate for vice president. That makes concerns about overt bias against women and the many ways that gender affects our perceptions of credible leadership as relevant as they were in the last two Democratic primaries. Clinton may have ended the candidacy of Lincoln Chafee with her one word dismissal, and Warren may have defeated the campaign of Michael Bloomberg with her intelligence, but those powerful displays did not halt the concern that the losses of these women candidates were fueled by sexism.
In order to beat Trump, Democrats have to be aware of these pitfalls and take stock of them. Assuming gender will be positive for how the ticket is perceived is not an option yet neither is ignoring this. Biden has to call out gender criticisms about his running mate as fit, and account for the risks and benefits of a woman on the ticket with healthy pessimism.

It is a clear attempt to suppress the vote across communities of color, including in Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. What is happening in Texas marks a preview of the challenges people could face when they vote in November.
The Texas primary elections are held today in the midst of the spreading coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Texas state leaders and officials have continued this stubborn opposition to voting by mail, which would make elections safer for everyone. Under restrictive state laws in Texas, mailed ballots are only available if residents are 65 or older, have a disability or illness, or will be out of the county during the election period.
A multiracial and nonpartisan coalition is now pushing to ensure all Texans can vote by mail in the general election in November. That includes Harris County, which surrounds Houston and has a population of more than four million people. We are doing this because what is true in Texas is true all across the nation. Voting by mail increases both safety and convenience. Texas officials know this. As only one example, Senator John Cornyn has voted by mail numerous times, including for a general election.
Asian American and Pacific Islander voters and all voters of color would benefit from efforts to accelerate and expand voting by mail. Our recent brief found that 23 percent of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters are habitual users of voting by mail, the highest among all racial groups. But less than 3 percent of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters in Texas regularly use mailed ballots due to restrictive state laws.
Let us move past the biggest and most bogus argument against voting by mail, which is the false claim that it leads to voter fraud. But the reality is that the United States has seen less than 150 convictions for fraud using mailed ballots, not in one year or five years, but in the past two decades. That is a miniscule fraction of total votes cast for that time. Anyone who talks about increased fraud with voting by mail is simply wrong.
By contrast, the benefits of voting by mail are indisputable, especially for more accessible and convenient voting for all. It makes perfect sense that Asian American and Pacific Islander voters have exhibited preferences for using mailed ballots. This population is disproportionately limited English proficient. Even if polling places make voting materials available in Asian languages, as many but not all districts have been required to do, Asian American and Pacific Islander voters appreciate the ability to cast their ballots at home with language assistance from family members.

Trump: Election results could be delayed by months
Texas and other states must adopt the gold standard practices that allow more people to take advantage of voting by mail, including a “no excuse” permanent voting by mail option for all residents. Other steps that states and communities can take now include providing better language access, including multilingual educational materials about how and when to vote, sending out prepaid return envelopes, and allowing voters to turn in their completed ballots at official polling places on Election Day.
Our research shows the portion of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters who use voting by mail rises in places that adopt these kinds of policies, and we are sure the same is true among all population groups. Whether in Texas or other states, those against voting by mail are on the wrong side of history, especially in the face of the coronavirus crisis. For communities of color and all Americans, voting by mail provides a safer means of making sure our voices are heard at the ballot box.

President Trump
has solved almost every policy challenge that the Democrats identify. The document, which is the product of extensive collaboration between Biden and Sanders, includes some of the most left wing proposals ever considered by the party. It urges liberal lawmakers to work toward a government health care system, enact new environmental regulations, overhaul the criminal justice system, and more.
Such proposals are usually excluded from the party platform for fear that they would alienate moderate voters. But the Democrats have shifted so far to the left that the party has become almost unrecognizable to some lifelong members. Pleased by the work of the Unity Task Force, Sanders has praised the former vice president for his new embrace of the radical platform, declaring that the platform is poised to make Biden the “most progressive president” since Franklin Roosevelt if he is elected.
Ideological extremism, however, is only half of this problem. Democrats have written dangerous prescriptions for mild diseases that have already been cured by Trump. According to the Unity Task Force, for instance, the federal government must spend gargantuan amounts of money on green energy and other environmental policy proposals since Americans have “the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live without fear of exposure to toxic waste.” It is clearly an undisputed objective.
From his very first day in the White House, Trump has implemented robust environmental protections, ensuring that Americans have access to clean air and clean water no matter where they live, without asking them to pay such exorbitant costs or endure regulations that reduce jobs and damage the economy. “That means being good stewards of our public lands, and prioritizing a clean up of polluted lands that threaten our most vulnerable citizens and threaten them very dearly, and implementing growth policies to unlock innovation and new technologies,” Trump declared.
Moreover, the Unity Task Force doctrine strives to reduce prescription drug prices and premiums, cut back overall health care expenses, and tackle inequities in the health care system. Democrats think these goals must be achieved only by implementing “universal health care coverage” through an inefficient single payer government program, but Trump has demonstrated with his actions that the opposite has been true.
Thanks to his emphasis on accountability and transparency, prescription drug prices have fallen in recent years, helping Americans save billions of dollars on medications. Trump has worked to improve the quality of health care for millions of our forgotten veterans by reforming and modernizing the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that our national heroes who are home do not die while they wait for routine medical care.
Another section of the Unity Task Force doctrine is dedicated to criminal justice reform. This is ironic given the role Biden played in implementing the “tough on crime” sentencing laws that created many of the problems he seeks to solve. Democrats want to enact bold changes to the criminal justice system to minimize police brutality and reduce crime. While their ambitions are laudable, their methods remain questionable. In what looks like an attempt to appease progressives, the doctrine pushes lawmakers to “reimagine policing for the benefit and safety” of citizens.
The Hill's Campaign Report: What to watch for in Tuesday's primaries
Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks
The truth is that no one else in Washington knows more about enacting effective criminal justice reform than Trump. The historic First Step Act made critical changes to the federal sentencing guidelines, established innovative new education programs for inmates, achieved reductions for nonviolent felons incarcerated under obsolete laws, and much more. The president has also signed an executive order on safe policing to address some of the worst deficiencies for outdated protocols without affecting the ability of law enforcement to protect innocent citizens.
As Trump has clearly demonstrated in almost four years as president, we can protect the environment without dismantling the energy sector, lower health care costs without turning medicine into a public utility, and reform the criminal justice system without defunding the police.

The lead of Joe Biden over Donald Trump and falling job approval of the president point to the potential for a landslide White House victory for the Democrats, as well as competitive races for Congress.
Biden now maintains a national lead of nine points over Trump, according to the Real Clear Politics average, while the job approval of the president has fallen six points to its lowest level in almost two years. The declining polling position and waning job approval of Trump are having a negative impact on Republican candidates in races down the ballot.
If Trump loses badly in November, which is entirely possible at this point, then we can expect his defeat to cascade down to Republican candidates with competitive House and Senate races. Given that Democrats have also framed the election as a referendum on Trump, his poor position presents an opportunity for Democrats to not only defeat him, but also to maintain control of the House and possibly take back the Senate.
In several Senate races, Democratic challengers are favored to beat the Republican incumbents, signaling an opportunity to flip Republican seats. Only one Democratic seat, Alabama, is a likely pickup for the Republicans, while there are around five seats that Democrats have a chance to win in Maine, Arizona, Montana, Colorado, and North Carolina.
This is especially the case in Arizona, where coronavirus cases have been skyrocketing and the hospitals have almost reached full capacity. Trump is trailing Biden by seven points in the state, according to a recent New York Times survey, despite Trump winning Arizona by four points in 2016. In the Senate race, incumbent Republican Martha McSally has fallen behind her Democratic challenger Mark Kelly by about seven points.
In North Carolina, Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham, a former state senator and lieutenant colonel with the United States Army Reserve, leads the Republican incumbent Thom Tillis by nearly ten points, according to a survey by Public Policy Polling. In Montana, former Democratic Governor Steve Bullock leads incumbent Republican Senator Steve Daines by four points, according to a survey by University of Montana.
Moreover, Democrats also have a significant edge in the House. They hold a national generic ballot lead of eight points, as 50 percent of voters said they would support the Democratic candidate in their district, while only 42 percent of voters said they would support the Republican candidate, according to a recent survey by Monmouth University.
Given their advantage, if the election were held today, it seems likely that Democrats would win the White House and the Senate, while maintaining control of the House. But we are still months away from the election, and it is entirely possible that the circumstances could change in the coming days. To be sure, both parties have risk factors. Democrats may move even further to the left or be positioned that way by this fall.
It is apparent, given recent results of primary elections, that the party has moved further to the left. If this is reflected in the mainstream policies of Democrats, it could result in their advantage shrinking. This is particularly true if the party starts to embrace progressive policies that are unpopular with most voters, such as defunding the police. Democrats have to find a way to unite progressives and moderates around a message of unity and an inclusive agenda that can bring the country together.

For Republicans, it is clear that the president is putting the party in danger of a substantive loss in November. But if Trump can develop a message of unity and make this election a choice between him and Biden rather than a referendum on his performance in the White House, the race could get much closer. Indeed, Biden leads by only six points in key swing states, despite Trump having an absolutely horrible recent streak.
It is entirely clear that Trump faces an uphill battle to win a second term, and Democrats appear poised to win big if they stay away from moving further to the left. Finally, a substantial victory for Biden would severely hurt Republican candidates in races down the ballot and may result in a considerable across the board Republican defeat this fall.

0,07/10/20 07:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/506820-can-iraq-win-the-war-on-corruption,Can Iraq win the war on corruption?,"As Iraq resumes negotiations with the United States over the fate of the strategic relationship, hopes have been raised that the reformist Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhimi may finally be able to address the debilitating problems that have stymied the transition of the beleaguered country to democracy. The problems in particular are the entrenched sectarianism and the kleptocratic political system wasting critical resources.
Even in the time of the coronavirus, corruption is the central issue facing Iraq today. The protesters that toppled the previous government last year decried the incompetence and opacity of government institutions run by the elite. There were demands for jobs and a  broad movement rejecting the status quo. The anger caused by corruption was so intense that even brutal retaliation could not break the resolve of the protesters.
Kadhimi has won cautious approval from their movement. He has shown encouraging signs to address their key demands of pushing back against Iranian influence and rooting out corruption, and ordered a review of the government payroll to eliminate “ghost employees” and illegal duplicate salaries. He also carried out a raid against one of the Shia militias. Yet the path toward achieving meaningful reforms will be long and treacherous, as evidenced by the shocking assassination of outspoken security expert Hisham Hashimi, widely viewed as a warning shot to Kadhimi.
Almost two decades after the troubled transformation from dictatorship to aspiring democracy, governance is still debilitated by endemic graft. Despite vast oil wealth with the potential to benefit all citizens, the Iraqi state is essentially engineered to launder oil revenues through a bloated public sector for political parties based on patronage and the parastatal armed forces while avoiding any form of real accountability.
The pandemic and plummeting oil prices have placed new strains on the Iraqi state, exposing the corrosion of public institutions, such as medical schools and hospitals, an inevitable byproduct of squandered revenues. Hospitals and private clinics have been overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis, lacking therapeutic medical supplies and even personal protective equipment for thousands of doctors, nurses, and other staff.
The inevitable fall in revenues has made it impossible for the government to prop up what is left of its safety net, and any belt tightening is likely to ignite anger considering that about half of the Iraqi budget goes to state salaries, pensions, and benefits for government workers. The severe risks of unrest and financial collapse are real, as the challenges magnify each other, compounding the public distrust in state institutions.
The power sharing system is the most intractable obstacle. At the root of the corruption is muhassassa, an informal consociationalism adopted in 2003 which prioritizes party interests over technocratic competence. It has ushered in a political culture that divides government power among party members who hold the authority to appoint some 800 civil service positions across ministries during the cabinet negotiations.
With every election, each party has used its ministry to employ more and more members and followers. This has therefore expanded the payroll and ultimately conditions access to the job market, which the state dominates, on allegiance to party. The payroll has ballooned from 850,000 workers in 2004 to more than seven million workers in 2016, with the party members primarily benefiting. So political parties in Iraq have captured government institutions with intricate patronage networks, forming parallel institutions and perverting the function of public office for personal gain.
While Kadhimi and his team should be applauded for the bold actions they have taken, unraveling the kleptocratic networks will require more efforts. Iraq needs a paradigm shift and realization that such problems are not just structural but cultural. Indeed, the young protesters originated with major demands for an entitlement to employment by the government. Without a cultural shift away from patronage by the state and toward accountability to the people, corruption reforms will struggle to gain traction.
Trump: Election results could be delayed by months
There should be strong media outreach with persuasive data to illustrate the volume of corruption and its negative impact. An environment that is conducive to change needs to be built. Groups that fight corruption also have to take advantage of the existing support by government officials to introduce the necessary policies and build a political culture of individual initiative. Such a culture would acknowledge the price of corruption, and reorient society away from resource dependence and toward economic diversification, fiscal responsibility, and political accountability.
For the first time in years, one can cautiously praise the recent measures taken by the government of Iraq to address the many ills that still plague this perennially troubled country. However, there is lots to do and a ways to go before it can come close to winning the war on corruption.

Politicians responsible for drawing these districts in many states are fine with voters having to risk exposure to the coronavirus to face any real accountability at the ballot box.
Many voters across the country feel excluded from the electoral process because politicians have drawn these districts in a way to ensure they win reelection or keep their party in power. Voters have had enough. Voters in several states like Nevada, Oregon, Arkansas, and North Dakota, are trying to remove this partisan gamesmanship from the redistricting process. This makes sense because the players should not be the umpires.
This process starts with the 2020 census, which has the goal of counting everyone who is living in the United States as of three months ago. Once the bureau finishes this monumental task, the data is then given to states in 2021 to draw new lines for districts for Congress and state legislatures. That means that if democracy reform does not go through this year, then gerrymandered districts remain in place for the next decade.
In many states, the governor and legislature are responsible for drawing these new districts. Unsurprisingly, when one party has unilateral control over the map drawing, they typically go on to give themselves more and safer seats than they otherwise would if the process was fair.
One important solution to this unacceptable partisan gerrymandering is the creation of independent redistricting commissions. These are bodies that are separate from the state legislature tasked with drawing maps in a much more transparent process. The proposed Arkansas commission, for instance, would be composed of nine randomly selected citizens from the two major political parties along with independents and voters registered with other political parties. The commission would be tasked with drawing district maps that, among other things, have partisan fairness.
To get this measure on the ballot, supporters must collect the signatures of over 89,000 Arkansas residents. In normal times, this means standing outside of concerts, farmers markets, and other events with large crowds. The person collecting signatures, known as the circulator, has to witness each signature in their presence. The circulator then has to go to a notary to affirm they have witnessed all signatures being submitted. In the midst of the pandemic, events have been canceled and standing within six feet of large numbers of people is unsafe. Even worse is that some politicians have refused to make this electoral process safer for all of us.

Most view news media as biased, but critical to democracy: poll
I represented voters in Arkansas and North Dakota in federal court, and I argued that these groups and supporters should be able to express their fundamental right to support a ballot measure on redistricting safely. The North Dakota court disagreed while the Arkansas court decision removing the witnessing and notarization requirement has been paused pending an appeal. Arkansas politicians, in the midst of the pandemic that has rising coronavirus cases, argue that supporters have not been burdened. They have looked at the voters and simply shrugged their shoulders.
The fight is far from over. Grassroots organizations in Arkansas and North Dakota have submitted over 100,000 signatures and 36,000 signatures, respectively, to get independent redistricting commissions on the ballot in November. This reflects what we already know, which is that voters on both sides of the aisle overwhelmingly prefer fair redistricting. Politicians, however, are generally reluctant to give up their power. They have shown so many times that they would rather protect their ability to gerrymander than allow voters in states to safely support democracy reform.

It may be tempting to think that only the obviously impacted sectors, like health care and the service industry, need to adapt and learn from the pandemic. In truth, however, the coronavirus has touched more spheres of the economy and society than can easily be observed.
Among the most important of these spheres is education. Public officials and schools have been forced to implement new and innovative ways to teach our children from kindergarten to earning advanced degrees. The coronavirus has exposed a deeply rooted problem in education that may damage our economy long after the pandemic subsides.
That problem is a lack of preparedness for the future. As the private sector continues to grow increasingly digitized every year, many students across the country lack a basic understanding of technology and are becoming less qualified for the thousands of advanced manufacturing jobs that will soon dominate the economy. Often from the marginalized communities, these students are on the wrong end of the digital divide.
The digital divide is the visible disparity between the haves and the have nots. In few places is this disparity more apparent than in schools. Those children who have early access to technology are positioned to succeed down the road. They are digitally literate, informed, and equipped to one day become leaders in politics, business, and society, all of which will be touched in different ways by the presence of technology.
But those who do not have advanced technology at home and school are at a great disadvantage. As members of the digitally illiterate generation, they will find that the country which educated them will have few places for them in a modern economy built around electronics, computerized engineering, and information services. As children left behind, they will find that domestic companies will prefer better trained employees from our competitors in places such as China and India, and local legislators will do little more than shrug their shoulders in sympathy.
The coronavirus crisis has made the digital divide a double edged sword. Under normal circumstances, many students have already been missing out on an education in digital technology that is critical to their futures. But in an extraordinary time when remote schooling is the only option, they do more than just fail to learn about technology. They fail to learn anything at all. The pandemic has shown that basic internet access and digital capabilities are not simply essential to the education of children, but are also quickly becoming essential to their success.
The answer to the digital divide is clear. Policymakers must push for schools across the country, and particularly those in less resourced communities, to invest for connecting students with next generation technology now. The 5G wireless network will not only allow students stuck on the wrong side of this digital divide to learn at lightning fast speeds, but also enable cutting edge technology like augmented and virtual reality to be used within future business processes.

By learning how to use technology early, students will be better poised to enter the workforce of tomorrow. Legislators, educators, and leaders have to refuse to fall into the trap of pushing off important investments without immediate returns. If there is a silver lining to be found in the pandemic, it is the realization that the resilience of our economy is owed to the key fact that more business is now conducted online than ever before.
Rather than chalking this up to the demands of an emergency, we have to understand that the digital trend is here to stay. We have to take action by spending money today to equip the future generation of workers with the skills to compete both at home and in the world. Schools should not label technology classes and online homework capabilities as luxuries. Sooner than later, knowing how to use technology and having all resources to do it will be far from luxuries. They will be absolute necessities.

would appoint liberal activist judges to the Supreme Court, securing left wing dominance over the third branch of government for decades. Such a distinction is not merely political.
Originalists such as Justice Clarence Thomas assist the Supreme Court to fulfill its core purpose of interpreting the Constitution and then applying its understanding of the intent of the founders to contemporary debates. But judicial activists such as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg bend and twist the Constitution to suit ideological agendas, handing the only unelected branch of government a dangerous amount of power for change.
The former vice president would no doubt seek to build upon the legacy of President Obama, who added liberal extremists such as Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. Obama also nominated California Supreme Court Justice Goodwin Liu to the critical Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, despite support shown by Liu for radical views such as a right to receive welfare. Liu was even rumored to be on the shortlist of judges for Obama to select for the Supreme Court.
Sotomayor once declared that a wise Latina could be more likely to reach a better legal conclusion than a white man, arguing that “experience and heritage” should play an influential role in decisions by judges. If elected president, there is no doubt that Biden would apply that same reasoning that led Obama to select Sotomayor. Biden has already pledged that he will use race and gender as determining factors in his choice, promising to choose a Black woman for his first Supreme Court nomination.
Ginsburg, who has attained cult hero status on the far left in recent years, would serve as another model for Biden to follow when making his pivotal decision for Supreme Court nominations. Ginsburg famously claimed that the South African Constitution would serve as a better model for a newly democratic country to follow than the United States Constitution.
Progressive activists see Biden as an opportunity to secure the Supreme Court for the left over the next several decades. Some have even floated the idea of expanding the number of Supreme Court justices to “pack” it with liberals the next time a Democrat wins the White House. Biden has rejected that idea, but the enthusiasm it has from progressive activists says plenty about what the left wing of the party wants from him.
Liberal organizations have seized upon the promise of Biden to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court, urging him to consider someone like Leslie Abrams, the sister of Stacey Abrams, or liberal academic Michelle Alexander, who compared the nation of Israel to apartheid South Africa. Though Biden himself has not yet released his own shortlist of potential nominees, progressive activists who would wield immense power in his potential administration are already narrowing down the names.

Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks
We cannot afford to give Biden the opportunity to appoint new Supreme Court justices. With so many important cases decided along such narrow political lines, and with the “conservative majority” becoming increasingly fragile as Chief Justice John Roberts continues to drift leftward, the way to prevent a liberal takeover of the highest court in the land is to ensure that the next few vacancies are filled by reliably conservative judges.
President Trump
has spent almost four years nominating record numbers of judges to the federal bench. The Senate recently confirmed his 200th appointment to the judiciary. That includes two Supreme Court justices and numerous lower court jurists such as Fifth Circuit Court Judge Don Willett, who Trump added on his shortlist for the Supreme Court. These appointments instill a greater degree of confidence that Trump will keep pushing the third branch in the direction of originalism while he remains in office. Even if Biden is president for only one term, however, he could cement liberal control over the Supreme Court for generations.

But that right is being threatened by those who seek to promote fear and division. If fear prevails, the United States could be on a collision course to disaster in November. We cannot allow that to happen. Our nation is in an unprecedented situation. While state election officials have tried their best to hold primaries as the coronavirus pandemic rages, there have been major problems with the operations of several contests, from Georgia to Wisconsin, and plenty of challenges in others.
The causes of these problems were largely predictable. Polling stations were shut down, often without notice, due to a lack of workers, meaning long lines at those polling stations that were open. There were faulty and untested equipment and poll workers not knowing how to operate them. There were delayed results and absentee ballot requests not processed due to current staffing levels. None of this is acceptable in 2020.
Local and state officials from both parties know best what assistance they need to prepare for the election. They have made their calls clear for new funding, including federal funding, to help make voting safe and secure. The $400 million they have received so far from Congress unfortunately  does not even begin to cover all of the costs to make voting safe.

Imagine for a second what could happen without adequate preparation and funding to make that possible. We are experiencing a resurgence of the coronavirus. What if that were to worsen this fall during the election? The problems we have seen across the nation this year could occur on a massive scale in November, leading to widespread disenfranchisement, delayed results, and a questionable outcome. The fallout from an election that Americans view as illegitimate would shatter confidence and trust in our democratic system. That kind of chaos is simply not an option.
Adding to the threat are the foreign adversaries up to mischief and again trying to interfere in our elections. They will be certain to pounce on any opportunity to make an already chaotic situation worse. If we fail again to protect our most cherished right to free and fair elections, we will send a message to the world that the United States cannot protect itself. So how do we protect ourselves from a potential election disaster? There is a full range of options that election officials are exploring but, to successfully use them, they need more funding. Absentee voting has been standard procedure for our men and women in uniform around the world.
Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel cast his first vote sitting on top of an armored carrier in Vietnam in 1968. Absentee voting has been the safe and acceptable way for those defending our freedom to have their say in the future direction of our nation. Americans have increasingly embraced absentee voting, early voting, no excuse mail voting, and other alternative voting methods. None of this has been controversial. What has changed? The answer is partisan politics. We cannot allow this, however, to blind us to what must be done. Thankfully, Republican and Democratic governors and other leaders are stepping up to provide voters with the options that best work for their states. Their efforts deserve all of our support.
The reality is that many states simply do not have experience with larger numbers of voters casting absentee ballots. But almost every state now has an overwhelming uptick in requests for ballots. In Indiana, Maryland, District of Columbia, and other states, this has led to the failure to deliver them to some voters in time. This injustice must not be tolerated and can be corrected by November with financial support from Congress.

Other options like increased early voting and safe voting in person are just as important and just as resource intensive. Outreach to younger and less vulnerable poll workers must be done to help fill the increasing vacancies among traditional volunteers. The public must also be made aware of the options to participate and those steps necessary for each to work.
Despite the Civil War, the Spanish Flu, the World Wars, and other difficult times in our history, our nation has successfully maintained an unbroken succession of citizens defending the future of their country by exercising their right to vote. The torch of responsibility has now been passed on to all of us to ensure that every eligible voter across the nation has the right to a free and fair election to decide the future of the United States.

, you Democrats will lose.” That was the warning of a Republican friend of mine. He detests the president and expects to vote for Joe Biden, but he clings to his Wall Street Journal values. He is worried that Trump has cleverly and effectively moved the spotlight away from the grotesque image of a cop kneeling on a Black man to an image of sledge hammers against marble statues. He predicts that Republican voters who now doubt Trump will return to him if the 2020 election is not about him but about culture.
I can hear some of my fellow Democrats agitating. “Who cares what a country club Republican thinks? It is not about politics. It is about the higher cause of eliminating racism whether it is systemic or symbolic.” While they may have a point, this uncomfortable topic bears exploring.
Let me be clear that we should not be memorializing traitors and racists. I realize that as a white man, I can never truly understand how it feels for Black Americans to see the people who enslaved, beat, and raped their ancestors immortalized in marble. I suppose the closest I could come to understanding is the statue of Charles Lindbergh in Minnesota. Lindberg was a rabid antisemite who found common cause with Adolf Hitler. His heroism in piloting a plane across the Atlantic Ocean remains scarred by his noxious views on Jews. His statue has been forever stained with hate.
But what if my Republican friend is right? What if Trump, the most potent demagogue in recent history, finds a way to win his second term on the backs of the broken statues of Confederates? What if such a strategy to change the narrative from George Floyd to George Washington works?
The biggest electoral dilemma that Trump faces today is an erosion of support by white voters without a college degree. He has no path to win unless he reclaims them. What better way than to scare them back? His speech at Mount Rushmore should be accompanied by the soundtrack of the movie “Nightmare on Elm Street.” It was one of the darkest speeches by an American president. Trump stands at the brink of this culture war holding a torch in one hand and a John Birch manifesto in the other.
The subtext of the campaign this year may be coming to grips with our past as a country. History had often gripped me when I was a member of the House of Representatives. I had founded the bipartisan Congressional Battlefield Preservation Caucus, organized several congressional trips to Gettysburg Battlefield National Park, and hosted salons with authors of history, such as Doris Kearns Goodwin, Walter Isaacson, and others.
Late at night, I loved walking through an empty Capitol Building. My only company were the ghosts of history and the marble statues. I imagined the echoes of John Adams and Daniel Webster as I crossed Statuary Hall. In the small Senate rotunda, I would trace the stone walls with my fingers and imagine the hand of Abraham Lincoln where mine was. I would stand mesmerized at the foot of Capitol Hill looking at the monument to Ulysses Grant on his horse in 1862. His collar is folded up and his hat is sitting low on his forehead. You can almost feel the driving sleet of that night, as he surveyed the carnage after the Battle of Shiloh and decided to attack the Confederate positions the next day instead of retreat with his soldiers.
During these walks, I noticed how age had affected the memorials. There were slight imperfections and discoloration in the stone. This was an apt metaphor since age exposes the frailties of our leaders and history itself. The passing years remind us of our imperfections. So I have found my own reconciliation with the passionate debates and the political consequences of public symbols. Our noblest ideal is not sculpted into stone but written on parchment to form a more perfect union. It is a stunning admission by our Founding Fathers. We are not perfect as humans and, therefore, will never have a perfect union. The best we can do is try to be more perfect.
The Nation reporter says DHS agents 'upset' at administration over '...

Let us sculpt, chisel, and erect more statues to the men and women who worked to make us more perfect. We can do what Franklin Roosevelt did in another economic crisis and fund artists to memorialize the extraordinary times in our public places. Let us enhance those places with more statues of the civil rights leaders Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks, of the civil rights martyrs James Cheney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, of the suffragist heroes Susan Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and others.
We should lift the words “in order to form a more perfect union” from the parchment it is written on and embed them in stone. We should let those portrayals remind us who we are at our best. We are flawed but fearless, human but humane, and always striving to build a better country for our children. That notion will not only shape the election but history as well.

0,07/07/20 06:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/506257-down-with-confederate-monuments-up-with-the-stars,"Down with Confederate monuments, 'up with the stars'","During the national debate about American symbols and monuments, Donald Trump
makes two claims: He argues it is an affront to our heritage to take down Confederate monuments and rename military bases honoring Confederate generals, and he also demands that everyone — including athletes and others protesting racial injustice in our society — must act in ways that are properly respectful of our flag.
The first argument makes little sense. The second is starkly inconsistent with the first.
Monuments memorialize individuals and events that deserve to be honored. They do more than describe the past. They assign value to it. To put it simply, all individuals who played a role in American history, every event of any magnitude, is part of American history. But it is absurd to suggest that all such aspects of our heritage deserve to be honored with monuments.
During the American Revolution, 15 percent to 20 percent of the colonists were loyalists who maintained their allegiance to the British Crown. They supported British forces. Thousands took up arms against the patriots fighting for our independence. These loyalists are part of our heritage. Should we memorialize and erect monuments to them?
During the early 1900’s millions of Americans were members of the Ku Klux Klan. They are part of our heritage too. Should we erect monuments to Klan leaders as well?
Playing a part in American history, standing alone, doesn’t justify erecting monuments to people or naming military bases after them. To deserve this kind of recognition, historical figures have to have done and stood for things worthy of our admiration over time. What did the leaders and generals fighting for the Confederacy do? What did they stand for?
First, they fought to dehumanize and enslave an entire race of people. That cause deserves our contempt. It should receive no badge of honor.
Second, they took up arms against our flag. If Donald Trump demands respect for and allegiance to the American flag, why in the world does he insist on protecting monuments to, and honors for, those who disgraced it?
Trump’s apparent commitment to the flag is so great that he wants flag burning criminalized. The Supreme Court held in Texas v. Johnson in 1986 that it violates the First Amendment to punish protestors who burn the American flag as symbolic speech. This was a 5-4 decision emotionally argued by the justices on both sides.
Then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote a particularly passionate dissent. In it, he quoted in its entirety a poem titled “Barbara Frietchie” by John Greenleaf Whittier. Supreme Court justices do not typically recite poetry, much less entire poems, in their opinions. But Texas v. Johnson was a special case because the flag is a special symbol. The poem recounts an allegedly true story of how during the Civil War a Confederate army invaded the northern town of Frederick, Md. Seeing the American flag flying from the attic of Barbara Frietchie’s home, the rebel troops stopped and fired on it, and “rent the banner with seam and gash.” The elderly woman, Barbara Frietchie, took up the flag before it could fall and dared the soldiers below to shoot her, but to spare the flag.
Most law school case books do not include this poem when they publish the highly edited text of Texas v. Johnson. But for the many years I taught the First Amendment as a constitutional law professor, I always read the entire poem to my classes. I wanted my students to know not only the doctrine, but also the passion stirred by this case, and by the American flag.
I doubt Donald Trump has read either the Texas v. Johnson case or Whittier’s poem. If he did, he might think for a moment about who it was that fired on the American flag and “rent the banner with seam and gash.” It wasn’t Black athletes kneeling during the national anthem, calling for our country to live up to the ideals represented by our flag. It was the Confederates whom Trump wants to honor with monuments and the naming of military bases.
And this is the key point: If you demand respect for the flag, you cannot at the same time honor the Confederate leaders and generals who turned traitor against it. The flag was on only one side in the Civil War. It flew in the ranks of the Union troops under assault by Confederate rebels.
Loyal Americans rallied to the colors. In a popular song of the time, they marched to war singing:
Yes, We’ll rally round the flag, boys, rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.
We will rally from the hillside, gather from the plain.
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.

The Union forever, hurrah boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitors and up with the stars;
While we rally round the flag, boys, rally once again
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.

We are springing to the call of our brothers gone before
Shouting the battle cry of freedom
And we'll fill the vacant ranks with a million free men more
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.
The Union forever, hurrah boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitors and up with the stars;
While we rally round the flag, boys, rally once again
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.

We will welcome to our numbers, the loyal, true and brave,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom,
And although they may be poor, not a man shall be a slave,
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.

The Union forever, hurrah boys, hurrah!
Down with the traitors and up with the stars;
While we rally round the flag, boys, rally once again
Shouting the battle cry of freedom.
For those who respect both our flag and our history, the issue of taking down monuments to Confederate leaders and generals and renaming military bases honoring them should be an easy one.
As Americans we should rally round the flag, shouting the battle cry of freedom.
Down with the traitors and up with the stars.
Two Black moms say Secret Service handcuffed them, separated them...
That means taking down the monuments and renaming the bases.
Down with the traitors and up with the stars.

0,07/06/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/505965-justice-roberts-plays-the-long-game,Justice Roberts plays the long game,"To state that Chief Justice John Roberts has disappointed conservatives may be an understatement. He provided key votes in decisions rejecting the White House efforts to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and uphold a Louisiana abortion regulation. These votes, Curt Levey lamented in the Washington Post, “mark the death knell for conservative hopes” that the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court “would finally produce a reliably conservative court.” Levey criticized Roberts for being “guided by political strategy as much as legal principles.” His arguments against the chief justice compel at least these following two responses.
First, aside from these immigration and abortion decisions, the Supreme Court has produced decisions which reliably accord with those goals of conservatives. Consider the decision in the Seila Law case, released the same day as the Louisiana abortion ruling. Roberts wrote for the majority in striking down the configuration of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren that was enacted as law under President Obama. Congress created the institution to be led by a single director who could be removed by the executive branch only for cause, that is, if he or she engaged in some kind of malfeasance or negligence.
This kind of protection for agency heads has been imposed by Congress and accepted by the Supreme Court. However, it has never been popular with the advocates of limited government, who view complete executive branch control as a means to curb the growth of these federal agencies and the bureaucracy in Washington. For the Seila Law case, a majority of the justices embraced the view that the Constitution prohibits Congress from conditioning the removal power of the president. While the law that created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau did not eliminate the ability of the president to remove its director or even influence its policy priorities, the Seila Law case takes an important step toward the judicial recognition of this unqualified removal power available to the president.
Second, even assuming Roberts is guided by political considerations, that approach should not necessarily be viewed as problematic. Though many commentators and justices rail against the notion, the Supreme Court is a political actor within the American scheme of government. As Alexander Hamilton put it, the Supreme Court is possessed of neither “the purse nor the sword.” Dependent upon Congress for funding and lacking the means to enforce its own decisions, the Supreme Court must rely on the strength of its decisions, in writing for all to see, and the way it navigates the many controversial issues of public policy which come its way for its legitimacy.
It follows that, to the extent Roberts recognizes cases in which there is a risk that the Supreme Court might stray from its constitutional lane, such awareness should be seen as a benefit to the institution. Just because the majority of justices is inclined to decide a particular issue in one particular way does not, in some cases, necessarily mean it should. Sudden shifts in constitutional rules undermine the consistency and predictability that we associate with the rule of law in the United States. Adhering to precedent, as Roberts wrote in the decision striking down the Louisiana abortion law, is an important way for the Supreme Court to counter public claims that its decisions in major cases are arbitrary or that they are purely partisan.
The Global Fragility Act provides the tools to address long-term...
A closer look at those recent decisions of Roberts that have disappointed conservatives reveals that none is likely to be the last word on the subject. In the immigration case, the Supreme Court did not say that the president could not eliminate the program for young immigrants, just that he had to follow the proper steps to do so. In the abortion case, the Supreme Court did not say that states could not pass laws regulating the right of women to choose, just that they could not do it in the way Louisiana had wanted.
So it is worth remembering, as Alexis Toqueville famously remarked, that “there is hardly any political question in the United States that sooner or later does not turn into a judicial question.” Given that the justices of the Supreme Court serve for life, Roberts can certainly afford to play the long game as chief justice. Moreover, there is nothing necessarily wrong with his efforts to ensure that the government institution he leads can as well.

0,07/05/20 07:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/505944-americans-leave-large-cities-for-suburban-areas-and-rural-towns,Americans leave large cities for suburban areas and rural towns,"A combination of the coronavirus pandemic, economic uncertainty, and social unrest is prompting waves of Americans to move from large cities and permanently relocate to more sparsely populated areas. The trend has been accelerated by technology and shifting attitudes that make it easier than ever to work remotely. Citizens of all ages and incomes are moving in record numbers to suburban areas and small towns.
A perfect storm of factors makes the decision to leave major cities like New York very obvious. The dense nature of urban living and the lack of proper local government planning led to the coronavirus spreading five times faster in New York than the rest of the country. The city that never sleeps now resembles a ghost town in many areas after thousands of its wealthy and middle class residents fled early in the pandemic.
Many are moving to small towns north of the five boroughs. Four upstate counties have seen an incredible surge in real estate demand, while the rest of the New York market is cratering. In Ulster County, the number of homes now under contract nearly doubles the 2016 figures. It saw steady sales in March and April, while the overall New York market fell by almost 30 percent. Some people are staying at their vacation homes, but much data suggests there are many permanent moves in the works.
An estimated quarter of a million New York residents will move upstate for good, while another two million could permanently move out of the state. More than 16,000 New York residents have already relocated to suburban Connecticut. The preliminary figures show New York is also losing citizens to rural New England and Florida in significant numbers. Similar trends are also occurring in other large urban areas. There is a political element with the domestic migration at play across the nation, but what is more telling is the level of movement to the suburban areas and rural towns.
Over 40 percent of urbanites have browsed online for real estate, more than twice the level of people who live in the country. Redfin reports that more than a quarter of searches on its website are by urbanites in Seattle, San Francisco, and the District of Columbia searching for homes across less populated places. While real estate sales are down in San Francisco, where prices are falling by more than 50 percent, demand in its suburbs has been soaring, where prices are rising by almost 10 percent.
There has been a sharp uptick in interest in moving out to Montana, with the majority of new inquiries coming from California. Real estate sales in Montana are 10 percent higher than at this time last year. Rural Colorado, Oregon, and Maine have seen similar upticks in property sales. Vermont is going through a renaissance in real estate, with an agent there remarking that “people are buying houses without even seeing them.”
Some changes are much less obvious, yet even the hidden trends support the idea that cities are emptying out. In March and April, over two million young people had to move back with their parents or grandparents. When the allure of cities declines further thanks to the risk of disease, a crashing economy, and a future of telework, the flight to suburban and rural safety will continue well after a coronavirus vaccine hits the market.
Social unrest and urban crime rate spikes also raise the possibility of the sharp increase of exits from large cities. A breakdown in order, especially if police are defunded, could further downsize cities rebuilt with law and order approaches. Urban trends of the last 50 years are being reversed. Instead of smaller towns and rural areas facing the steep declines, large metropolitan areas may soon be the places bleeding citizens.

The moves and the circumstances that precipitated them will likely cause profound changes in the places receiving the most coronavirus refugees. It is still premature to forecast the political impacts of these demographic trends, but they could prove significant. Floods of former urbanites could bring more taxes, restrictions, and regulations to these areas.
On the other hand, an influx of money can reinvigorate former industrial towns. A curious question is whether the waves of new residents will see these smaller areas as their real homes or as places of convenience that need to be reshaped in the image of the cities they fled from.

0,07/04/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/505849-the-myth-of-the-boston-tea-party,The myth of the Boston Tea Party,"As the country celebrates Independence Day, many Americans will view monuments that have been toppled, defaced, or entombed in protective fencing. Businesses across the nation have been vandalized or boarded up, creating a surreal landscape for many this holiday.
Most protesters did not engage in rioting or looting. Yet the only thing more maddening than random destruction is an increasingly common media rationalization that the rioters are the new Boston Tea Party patriots continuing a tradition of property damage as a form of political speech. These rioters have as much in common with the Boston Tea Party as the antifa movement has with the antifederalists.
The rationalization is not new. After violence in Ferguson in 2014, Yale University hired Black Lives Matter figure Deray Mckesson to lecture on “transformative leadership.” His course included reading about looting as being a “righteous tactic.” He defended property damage as a tradition dating to the Boston Tea Party. Many in the media have raised the analogy, including Don Lemon, who recently chastised anyone judging the rioting because “this is how this country started.”
Even some academics have given these crimes the license of history or patriotism. Northwestern University professor Steven Thrasher wrote that “property destruction for social change is as American as the Boston Tea Party.” These statements misrepresent history. Consider five conflicts.
First, the Sons of Liberty did not commit “property destruction for social change.” The embrace of them as a model by the left is as comical as it is incorrect. They were the ultimate capitalist movement. Some of the men were merchants or smugglers upset with the sale of huge amounts of tea by the East India Company. One would think the current activists would be least likely to embrace a group of militant capitalists engaged in the most famous act of cultural appropriation in history.
The Sons of Liberty, dressed as Mohawk Indians, wanted to destroy the tea itself. The taxation of tea did not trigger this confrontation. Tea had been taxed, along with other items, since 1767 under the Townshend Revenue Act. In 1770, those taxes were lifted, except on tea, to enable the East India Company to sell over 540,000 excess pounds in storage by bringing it to the market in the colonies. The Boston Tea Party was more like supporters of American steel dumping Mexican steel in a Texas port. Targeting tea had as much of an economic as a political purpose.
Second, the Sons of Liberty were not looters. They did not take the tea home with them. Conversely, the looters seen carrying televisions out of stores were not desperately seeking a harbor to toss away cursed symbols of tyranny. They were stealing televisions. While academics like Keele University professor Clifford Stott may assure some that “looting is an expression of power,” it is primarily a crime for personal gain.
Third, the Sons of Liberty did not advocate wanton property destruction. In fact, they would have been the first to condemn the current vandalism. We know that because they had said so. Before boarding the ships, they agreed not to cause any damage beyond destroying the tea, as the ships were owned by Americans. Samuel Adams, one of the leaders, insisted that the Sons of Liberty carry out their mission “without the least Injury to the vessels or any other property.” After they broke a padlock to access one of the ships, they returned the next day to replace it.
That is in stark contrast to Black Lives Matter figure Hawk Newsome, who defended rioting since “this country was built upon violence.” He asked, “What was the American Revolution? What is our diplomacy across the globe?” He added, “If this country does not give us what we want, then we will burn down this system and replace it. All right?” The Sons of Liberty would say that is not right, as they did in the Boston Tea Party.
Fourth, the Sons of Liberty did not start the American Revolution. There is a popular myth that they were praised for their actions and galvanized the nation to rebel against the British Crown. Many patriots, including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, condemned their actions. It was the heavy handed response to this and other actions that fueled the call for independence. If England had not ratcheted up oppressive measures, the Boston Tea Party could have worked to its advantage, as many wanted to reconcile with the British Crown, including many of the Framers.
Fifth, the Sons of Liberty wanted freedom and representation. We now have a Constitution that affords us the rights that were denied to them. Yet violence and vandalism is being committed today despite the legal and legislative options for reforms. Indeed, after the killing of George Floyd, an array of reforms were proposed. The crimes of looting and rioting have made reforms more difficult instead of more likely.
The Global Fragility Act provides the tools to address long-term...
Samuel Adams declared, “Among the natural rights of the colonists are these. First a right to life, second to liberty, and third to property. Together with the rights to defend them in the best manner they can.” He would not have been in the mob shattering windows.

The vast majority of protesters have been peaceful. They have forced us all to think about racial inequities and personal prejudices. However, the destruction of property and monuments are the type of capriciousness that the patriots condemned. There are many contemporary causes for anger and rage. They are worth discussing today. But leave the Sons of Liberty and the Boston Tea Party out of it.

American troops were coming home in body bags with no end in sight and no way to measure victory. American citizens were called refugees in their own country and dying from the failed White House response to a disaster. The economy was about to collapse as a result of insufficient Wall Street oversight.
Heading into the 2008 election, Republicans were not just worried over losing the White House, they were worried about being completely run out of Washington. After suffering historic losses in the midterms, there was a common question asked among reporters and politicos inside the Beltway. How can Republicans stop the hemorrhaging? The answer was they could not. Democrats took additional seats in the House, won the Senate, and recaptured the White House with Barack Obama.
Heading into the 2020 election, Republicans find themselves in a similar conundrum. American troops are dying from the conflict in Afghanistan. American citizens are losing their lives thanks to the failed White House response to the coronavirus crisis. The economy is left in shambles with severe unemployment and an uncertain road ahead to recovery.
Before even adding external factors like the protests around the country, Republicans have to deal with such a historic drag at the top of the party ticket. Reporters and politicos are once again asking the same question. How can Republicans stop the hemorrhaging? The answer is to run away from the incumbent. But that will not work this time since Republicans in Congress have inextricably bound themselves with Donald Trump
.
For almost four years, the president has humiliated his detractors. He has forced them out of the party and sends a strong message to Republicans showing any semblance of independence. Trump came into the party like the corporate raiders of the 1980s with a hostile takeover. He has remade the party into his own image. He has employed his sycophants, destroyed anyone with the ounce of political courage to stand up to his abuses, and empowered those who pledged allegiance to him and him alone.
If Republicans run from Trump in their primaries, he has proven over and over that he will risk sinking their races to settle the score. If Republicans refuse to protect him and defend his outbursts, it can be devastating for their political careers. This means the only option for many in the party is to stick with him no matter what and to suffer the consequences.
The philosophy of Trump revolves around political fireworks and personal interests. With the prospects of Republicans tied to his odds and, without a foil as polarizing as Hillary Clinton, it becomes that much more difficult for the president to use the same tactics that worked in the 2016 election. Joe Biden
is trusted and liked by voters on both sides of the aisle. Biden is shielded from much of the Trump playbook as an older white man.

Biden has a critical advantage. Trump did not win because people wanted him to be president. Trump won because they never wanted Clinton to be president. That luck of the draw will not work this time around. Trump will not get the same benefit of the doubt from voters due to his actions. How can Republicans stop the hemorrhaging? The answer is they cannot.
Republicans created Trump and enabled him to ruin the party they love. All they can do is hope and pray that he does not torch their entire party and take his base with him on his way out of Washington. As Trump goes, so do Republicans, and it looks like they are going down in flames.

0,07/02/20 01:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/505619-the-politics-of-masks-from-copernicus-to-climate-change-to-coronavirus,The politics of masks: From Copernicus to climate change to coronavirus,"President Trump
won’t wear a mask. Many of his supporters won’t either. At his “campaign kickoff” in Tulsa, his Phoenix rally inside a church and other recent events, Trump and many of his followers seem committed to defying science. They’re doing this as COVID-19 cases are spiking in many states that reopened — in some cases, prematurely, without a plan or both.
As a physician and as an American, I’m concerned. Science is the process of arriving at verifiable, quantifiable facts through hypotheses, testing and refutation. When partisanship drowns out science, the results can be deadly.
A month ago, America began reemerging from lockdowns. Workers went back to their jobs, stores reopened and many people ditched their masks, acting as if the pandemic that has killed over 125,000 Americans since February never happened. 
Then, people started getting sick again. Arizona is running out of ICU beds and deaths are rising. Infections in Texas and Florida keep breaking new records.  
Amid rising fatalities, the simple act of wearing a mask has, for some, become a proxy for political affiliation or, more accurately, loyalty to President Trump. 
His most ardent supporters refuse to wear masks, following Trump’s disdain at covering the lower half of his face. Those who oppose him or support Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden
are more likely to wear masks. On the whole, an overwhelming majority of Americans want President Trump to model good behavior and wear a mask in public. In spring, some people protesting state governors’ stay-at-home orders showed up with weapons but no masks. In summer, many Americans who rallied against police violence and racial inequities wore masks and even handed them out, although clearly they couldn't and didn't maintain any degree of social distancing.
We’re learning more about COVID-19 every day. Much of medicine and science works this way.
As a doctor who finished medical school 22 years ago, I’ve learned many treatments for stroke, heart disease and cardiac arrest that exist today but were not used in the 1990s. We’re always learning new things because the science behind medicine is always evolving as we make new discoveries.
What we know about masks follows a similar dynamic.
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Americans not to wear masks. The reason: Not enough data to indicate whether masks reduced the transmission of the coronavirus. 
Now, public health experts are unanimous in urging individuals to wear masks in public, especially when social distancing isn’t possible. These cheerleaders include the CDC and U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who says masks promote greater freedom.
So why is there a seemingly partisan divide around masks? Do Republicans care less about their loved ones and neighbors? Or is there a deeper reason why some people reject science-based opinions?
In 1633, Galileo Galilei was sentenced to house arrest for being “vehemently suspect of heresy” for publishing views that Earth was not the center of the universe. At the time, the church was busy silencing scientists who challenged church dogma because it feared the budding spirit of enlightenment would undermine its absolute authority.
Fast forward to the 1980s when President Ronald Reagan made climate change a political issue. 
The National Academy of Sciences released a report in Reagan’s first term that corroborated the earlier Charney Report in 1979, compiled from a century of data, linking fossil fuel use to global warming. Yet Reagan appointee William Nierenberg, who ran the media briefing on the 1983 NAS report, lied about its findings, claiming the report found no need for action.  
Meanwhile, the fossil fuel industry began funding a fringe group of scientists to sow doubt in the public mind, by questioning whether the science behind climate change and its adverse impact on public health are real. Corporate dark money and right-wing organizations continue to funnel campaign money to Republican candidates who deny the climate crisis.
When one political party so thoroughly dismisses science, a good part of the American electorate will reject facts and mistrust experts. This is where we are today.
Scientific research increasingly shows that the widespread use of face masks will reduce the number of deaths and decrease the need for lockdowns to mitigate COVID-19 transmissions. Yet President Trump and many of his allies continue to question the efficacy of face masks, with his more extreme supporters suggesting that masks take away personal freedoms because they’re a form of government control.

Some Americans take their cue from the president. His mask aversion is their mask aversion. By stubbornly refusing to wear a mask, Trump is not-so-subtly telling his supporters that his own public health experts are wrong, the data is irrelevant and the science is wrong.
Today’s anti-mask, anti-science denialism is different from the church’s persecution of Galileo 400 years ago. The church’s repudiation of evidence resulted in Galileo’s house arrest for the rest of his life. Refusing to wear a mask amid today's pandemic can sicken or even kill people.

0,07/02/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/505597-women-must-continue-to-persist-to-rise-as-political-leaders-of-america,Women must continue to persist to rise as political leaders of America,"Back in 1972, Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman elected to Congress, ran to be president of the United States. She did not prevail, but her pursuit was crucial in the persistence needed to elect a woman to the White House. Today, Joe Biden is poised to put a woman on the ticket as vice president, something that was first tried in 1984. Biden may even make new history by partnering with a woman of color.
His announcement that he would select a woman to be his vice president followed the 2020 Democratic primary when six women ran for president, both white and African American, signaling a major shift from the past. It comes at a time when women are at the forefront of society. During this coronavirus pandemic, most nurses, teachers, child care workers, home health aides, and local public health officials are women.
It also comes at a time of demand for social justice. Women leaders like Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, those organizers of Black Lives Matter, and many others have raised their voices and have been heard. It comes at a time of economic crisis when racial and gender disparities are mirrored in the coronavirus pandemic and the struggle for social justice. Women voters are clearly more than ready for change.
But the path to the White House has been tough. In 1984, the Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco. The buzz was tremendous as Walter Mondale was set to announce the nomination of the first woman to be his vice president. Nancy Pelosi
led the volunteer host committee as she showed her fundraising efforts in gathering support for this event. As chief of staff for campaign member Barbara Mikulski, I had the credentials to be present that night. Mikulski went on to become the first Democratic woman elected on her own right to the Senate in 1986.
Every woman who worked on the 1984 campaign somehow found their way to the floor that night. It was an electric and extraordinary moment. The image making mirrored the times. Geraldine Ferraro appeared in a white dress as if to say the country could handle a woman acceding to power, but only if she came off as demure and virginal, looking like she was about to walk down the aisle. The ticket went down in defeat, but it was a crucial moment leading us to where we are today.
In 2008, John McCain faced a very uphill battle against Barack Obama. McCain surprised the country by picking Sarah Palin to be his running mate for the election. Looking for a game change, his advisers thought the Alaska governor might close the significant gender gap and add in more charisma to the campaign. That bet did not pay off. Palin was not prepared and, while previewing support for Donald Trump, set back the ascendance of a woman candidate on the national stage.
Yet we persisted. In the Democratic primary that year, Hillary Clinton
, a champion for women around the world, lost to Obama. But in 2016, she appeared on stage to accept the nomination for president of the United States. She also wore white, but times had changed. Now it was a bold choice, a pant suit, echoing the white dresses of suffragettes a century before. Such need for persistence from women remained when Clinton lost the Electoral College vote to the misogynistic Trump.

The country took a step back before moving forward again. After nearly four years of chaos, sexism, and racism from the president, the United States may finally move into the future. Some have argued that women are acknowledged when there is a mess to clean up or when power no longer matters. But women are coming to the forefront because of our persistence. We understand how to wield power for good.
We know how to clean up a mess. We know how to be effective principled leaders. So when a woman is sworn in as vice president, we will know it is because of Chisholm, Ferraro, Clinton, and even Palin, along with all of the women, brown, black, white, and every other color, who ever took a risk to lead and persisted until she did. To get to that historic moment, however, we must persist, register, and vote in the election this year.

0,07/01/20 07:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/505489-the-truth-about-karens,The truth about Karens,"As a woman with the name Karyn, I take personal offense to the cultural Karen stereotype and moniker. My response to it was visceral and I need to speak up. I can already hear people saying “how Karen of you.”
The misnomer Karen might be a convenient shortcut to explaining the profound problem of racism and white entitlement, but it raises another profound problem. Do not confront racism with sexism. It is misogynist stereotyping. Every nasty woman becomes a Karen. The term is often paired with other sexist put downs, like shrill or loud mouthed.
Calling a woman a Karen is simply another way of controlling women and their behavior, telling us to be quiet and stop complaining. It legitimizes misogyny. I speak out about injustices, equal rights, and climate change. My view is on the other end of the political spectrum from most Karens, but I am sure that my opponents would prefer that I too would shut up. I will not. Does that make me a Karen? Probably so in their eyes.
Some say this is not discriminatory because it applies to white women of privilege. Whatever its origins, Karen has turned into a pejorative directed only against people of a certain age, race, and gender, making it a slur by definition. Such an eponym serves no more useful purpose than any other offensive stereotype. In my own case, for example, although I am a middle aged white woman, I do not use such privilege to victimize others.
I am about as far from a supporter of Donald Trump as one can get. I do not wave guns at protesters. I like to think that I am not a racist and that I am progressive. I support Black Lives Matter and the movement to remove Confederate monuments. I do not have the “can I speak to your manager” bob haircut. I do not abuse Asian American health workers. I wear a mask in public. I stay at home in the pandemic. I know that I am privileged to be able to do so. The Karen stereotype does not help you to understand this Karyn, but still somehow, by virtue of my name, I am stuck with it.
Few Karens actually have the name Karen. When she was asked to leash her dog where it was required, Amy Cooper, the Central Park Karen, called the police shouting that an African American man was attacking her. Lisa Alexandria, the San Francisco Karen, called the police on James Juanillo, who was stenciling “Black Lives Matter” in front of his own home. Luckily he was recognized as a resident and was not harmed. I do not want my name associated with Amy or Lisa or any such despicable behavior.
Assigning an anonymous Karen moniker lets people like Amy and Lisa off the hook. Although people learned the real names of these two women, and they faced some negative consequences, that is not typical. There is the woman in New York who coughed on someone who called her out for not wearing a mask, the woman in California who rampaged against Asian Americans, and several others. They and their dirty deeds are under the cover of the Karen moniker. I do not know their names. Do you?

Like most real Karens, I am not this stereotype in thought, word, or deed. Since I missed the spelling only by the grace of my mother, I do take the twisted appellation as an affront to my name, which is the foundation of my identity. When I speak up, I am patronized with “alright Karen.”
I am told I should keep my feelings to myself and not take offense since the designation is clearly not meant for me. But I do not see it that way. There is nothing more personal than your name. It makes you stand out, distinguishes you, and ties you to your family. Ironically, using the term Karen classically sees nobody as an individual. Stereotypes such as this one have the same adverse effect on society. Let us stop it already.

0,07/01/20 02:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/505433-democratic-leaders-are-much-more-progressive-than-you-might-believe,Democratic leaders are much more progressive than you might believe,"The wave of the progressive movement rushes across districts and crests in primaries. Sometimes, however it can be misdirected, as in the case of a challenge to Representative Richard Neal
in western Massachusetts.
In New York, where the votes are still being counted, progressive Jamaal Bowman holds a double digit lead over House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel. In Rockland and Westchester counties, newcomer Mondaire Jones will likely secure the Democratic nomination to succeed House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey. Finally, inside the five boroughs, House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney maintains only a sliver of a lead against Suraj Patel.
Energized by these showings, some progressives have set their sights on Neal, who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He is being challenged by Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse. Every candidacy needs a rationale. According to Morse, Neal is part of the leadership in Congress and is “out of touch” with his district. When did being in the leadership and being progressive become mutually exclusive? Does sitting as the head of a committee mean you cannot stand up to Donald Trump
?
Morse has declared, “I think it is time we have a body that reflects the life experience and identity of the people we represent and what our country looks like.” He is correct, which is exactly why the Democratic leadership that he bemoans has worked hard to recruit and elect the most diverse House caucus in history on race, gender, and sexual orientation.
Neal is an ideological progressive. His ratings are 100 percent with the Human Rights Campaign, 100 percent with Planned Parenthood Action Fund, 92 percent with the League of Conservation Voters. Then they go down with conservative groups. His ratings are 12 percent with Club For Growth and 5 percent with Freedom Works. Does he have 100 percent progressive ratings like Representative Barbara Lee? No. Springfield is different from Berkeley. Trump won 37 percent of voters in his district.
Neal commits the unpardonable sin, to some, of mirroring the left of center orientation of his constituents instead of the farthest to the left. Morse has criticized Neal as not being sufficiently aggressive in forcing Trump to turn over his tax returns. Morse is right to be outraged with the smarmy stonewalling of the White House, but criticizing Neal for lack of effort is a brittle and breakable stretch across the campaign trail.
Neal demanded the tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service last year. The administration refused to provide them so Neal filed a lawsuit. The case is tied up in the courts. As a spokesperson for Neal said, “It was absolutely critical that no mistakes were made for Trump and his various attorneys to capitalize on. Neal worked closely with House counsel and followed direction on how to proceed.” I would imagine that even Morse has had to begrudgingly accept the legal advice offered by his Holyoke lawyers. The goal is winning in court instead of stomping around.
Morse should be praised for his good work on climate change. He has reportedly set Holyoke on a path to 100 percent renewable energy. But Neal has been assertive on the issue as well, introducing legislation for a more than $1 billion green infrastructure package. Finally, it seems that Morse is operating on the theory that the primaries in New York foretell victory everywhere else. As I have said before, Trump has been the most effective ally of Democrats in triggering energy among voters, especially progressives. But primaries are chapters. They are not books.
Democratic leaders report 'some progress' in talks with White House
Five primary races to watch on Tuesday
You have to understand the dynamics of each one. Dave Wasserman with the Cook Political Report said Engel “came under criticism late in the race for comments he made on a hot mic after not having been in his district in a while.” Engel had to fight a narrative that he had not paid attention to his district. Neal, on the other hand, was described by a Democratic strategist in Boston as following an “old school model of delivering for your district.” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler followed this playbook and handily won his progressive primary battle in New York.
Morse says recent momentum “indicates the winds of this country and the strength of the progressive movement.” He noted the Democratic race for president created energy and enthusiasm that has shifted to other races. He is right. But those winds should claim Trump and his enablers instead of the people who are best positioned to fight against them.

will face if his standing in public opinion polls holds up and he becomes the next president. High among these is the dramatic deterioration in the transatlantic alliance, which served American interests well for decades. Biden would inherit allies who have lost faith in the United States and no longer share a world view or a desire to work with Washington.
In Germany last year, Biden reassured European leaders that this would pass, but he was wrong. Public opinion polls show that both Europeans and Americans have turned inward, the ties that bind them have frayed, and their interests have diverged. Foreign policy analysts bemoan the isolationist sensibilities of Americans, but Europeans have also turned their backs on the United States. Around 60 percent of Europeans in a recent survey by the Council on Foreign Relations say their view of the United States has changed for the worse in the last few months.
Given such sentiment, it is not surprising a recent survey by the German Marshall Fund found there is no majority support by the French, German, or American publics for their governments to get involved in any number of current international issues. The strongest backing for more action was for restricting Iranian access to nuclear weapons and even then the allies disagreed. Less than 50 percent of Germans, 40 percent of Americans, and only 28 percent of the French wanted something done on this.
On most other issues, including the Sahel, Ukraine, Afghanistan, North Korea, and South China Sea, public support for decreasing international engagement tended to be greater than increasing involvement, especially in France and the United States. There was also no sign of support for the allies working together to deal with shared international challenges.
A majority of Americans back joining with Europeans on the coronavirus crisis, while a majority of the French and Germans support transatlantic cooperation in combating climate change. However, Americans disdain collaboration on climate change issues, and Europeans look askance at cooperation on the global health crisis. Moreover, on a whole range of other problems, such as Russia, China, economics, cybersecurity, and more, there is minimal public interest in transatlantic cooperation.
Finally, when it comes to the flashpoint of military burden sharing, only about a third or fewer of the Germans and the French and a quarter of Americans want to increase defense spending. Moreover, as both the United States and Europe face constrained revenues as they dig out of recessions induced by the pandemic in the last few months, aversion to defense spending could truly become an even bigger headache.
Without a shared desire to avoid another European war and absent an external adversary to create solidarity, Biden would need to refocus the transatlantic alliance on future challenges where there is at least some concern about the issues or willingness for international engagement to deal with them. Foremost among these should be climate change, the coronavirus, and the Iranian nuclear weapons program, which are each challenges that cannot be dealt with by countries acting alone.
To that end, Biden should announce that the United States would rejoin both the Paris Agreement and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Such initiatives have great symbolic value, signaling to Europe that the Americans are back. Washington and its transatlantic partners will then need an approach to improving their climate commitments consistent with an international goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks
Tensions flare as GOP's Biden probe ramps up 
With regard to Iran, Biden and the European allies should offer to freeze future sanctions on Iran in return for a freeze on advances in its nuclear weapons. They should begin talks with Iran on missiles, terrorism, and human rights. The United States and Europe should lift all trade barriers on medical supplies and equipment. They should also establish a joint stockpile to better respond to inevitable health emergencies.
During the Cold War, there were transatlantic differences, and these will undoubtedly continue. But Biden would have to deal with an even more divided alliance after the last several years. The only way to preserve the transatlantic alliance if he becomes president is for his administration to demonstrate that cooperation between the United States and Europe is the best way to solve the problems people care about most.

Putting aside the coming back and forth about what the president knew and when he knew it, this incident is simply the latest in which the inability of the United States to push back against Vladimir Putin merely emboldens a regime that needs no encouragement.
Vladimir Lenin said, “You probe with bayonets. If you find mush, you push. If you find steel, you withdraw.” Even if that quote is apocryphal, all Putin is finding now is mush and, unless something changes, it is all he will find. Russian interference in the 2016 election garnered political posturing but no consequences. Expeditions into Libya and Syria, both overt and covert, are met with condemnation but nothing more. The seizure of Crimea six years ago was met with sanctions and tepid support to Kiev. To this day, Ukraine finds itself mired in an ongoing battle on its own territory.
With an attempted coup in Montenegro, the destabilization campaign in Moldova, and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, the list of nefarious Russian activity goes on with very little in the way of responses. Of course, there is now a tendency to see Moscow behind every setback or development that is counter to Western interests. We created a boogeyman and, without a doubt, Putin is content to allow the myth to continue and spread. If your adversary thinks you are 10 feet tall, why disabuse that notion?
Mark Galeotti notes that Putin is more of an opportunist than one would otherwise suspect. He is less a chess master and more a judoka who uses the strength of adversaries against them. Catherine Belton, who wrote a fascinating book into his rise to power and the security and intelligence officials surrounding him, argues that the siloviki are following a plan to confront Western democracies while also enriching themselves.
These arguments are not mutually exclusive or contradictory. Leaders in Moscow want to confront Western nations, divide alliances, and reclaim what they view as their rightful place as a great power. By any real metric such as life expectancy, business creation, economic growth, or exports beyond natural resources, Russia is anything but a great power. However, Moscow pursues its political objectives by seizing upon opportunities to elevate its position to that of a great power. The civil unrest in the United States, Brexit in the United Kingdom, the Catalan election in Spain, and instability in Libya and Syria have presented such opportunities.
It appears the White House will not confront Putin with condemnations. After intelligence officials reported the bounty program, the president invited Russia back into the Group of Seven, according to the New York Times. Absent leadership from the very top, how can the United States push back against Putin? This is not to say there are not any options. As Belton wrote, Russian money is deeply entangled with Western nations among “friendly firms” and financial networks, many of which look the other way. As the saying goes, follow the money. We have to go beyond targeted sanctions and cut Russian access to Western markets.
Short-term health plans are a threat, not a victory, for sick patients
Watch live: Trump signs the Great American Outdoors Act
In Washington, the intelligence committees of Congress must get out of their torpor and hold public hearings to highlight what Moscow is doing, what it means, and how it is a threat both to the United States and to the Western liberal order. Such hearings are not for scoring political points or relitigating the 2016 election. With the blood of American soldiers on the hands of Russian military intelligence, this is not a partisan matter.
We have to empower the intelligence community and the instruments of diplomacy to aggressively push back against Russian activity, counter the interests of Moscow, and stymie its advance. Indeed, Langley must go on the offense like in the days of the Cold War. The goal is not just advancing American interests but frustrating Russian efforts wherever possible and warning other competitors. If we are to win in the new era of great power competition, we must shift our mentality and get out into the field. Russia is already there. The United States cannot afford to wait any longer.

Protesters and their allies are demanding just, inclusive institutions that redress grievances, promote equality, and offer broad-based opportunities to all communities. Driving justice reforms at home will challenge our near peer competitors, Russia and China, and highlight their profound governing weaknesses.
There are clear policy distinctions between successful and fragile states. Modern states that innovate, invest, and prosper have inclusive political institutions, functional governments, and a respect for the rule of law. Conversely, fragile states at risk of conflict, conquest or collapse suffer from authoritarian leaders and extractive institutions that fail to provide social, economic, and political opportunities for their citizens. America now has a choice. Do we continue to refine and improve our justice system? Or do we allow grievances to undermine the legitimacy of our institutions? The human toll of these policies is clear — citizens of fragile states are poorer, less educated and die earlier.
In the era where Russia and China will each seek to extend their influence, markets and military might, the Black Lives Matter protests give America a clear advantage.
To begin, the Russian and Chinese governments rest on fragile foundations. Both are ethnonationalist states that define their common heritage, history, and future along ethnic lines. The problem, of course, is that each country has a rich diversity of ethnic, religious, and language groups that may not accept an ethnonationalistic governing structure indefinitely — particularly during periods of economic downturn, pandemic, or other existential crises.
Russia, for instance, has 140 million citizens with nearly 200 different ethnic groups, multiple language groups totaling 20 percent of the population whose native tongue is not Russian, and a Muslim population between 10-15 percent. Russia continues to maintain a low boil internal war with Chechnya, its province in the North Caucasus. Rather than effectively addressing Chechnyan grievance, the conflict became a rallying cry for global jihadists, seeding fighters throughout the Middle East and North Africa.
China, ten times larger than Russia, officially recognizes 56 ethnic groups numbering 105 million people. If the minority population of China were a country, it would be the 14th most populous on earth. Nearly 30 percent of Chinese citizens do not speak Mandarin as their first language. Christianity is booming in China; soon it could become the world's largest Christian nation. One million Muslim Uighers live in concentration camps in Xinjiang province; these concentration camps undermine Chinese state legitimacy and regional influence.
Russia and China also face other fissure points. Both have serious urban/rural divides and limited LGBT protections. Ironically, perhaps, for post-communist societies, both Russia and China face similar levels of wealth inequality as the United States. Given that both of these states have authoritarian governments that control media and preclude dissent, the world may not appreciate their inherent structural weaknesses and may overestimate their geopolitical strengths.
The opposite is true in America. Cable news and social media heighten political polarization, nationwide protests, a failing economy, and a resurgence of COVID-19. America appears as a chaotic, weakened, and declining power; yet, with a constitutional history of decentralized government, enumerated individual rights, a free media and a talented people, the United States may simply be better prepared than Russia and China to face the challenges of the next generation.
The American experiment to create a more perfect union has certainly been flawed at times, but the Black Lives Matter protests offer an opportunity to reform law enforcement, build a better justice system, and create a more fair society. To be that beacon, the nation must take four steps.
First, the public and private sector must draw from the deepest talent pool possible where merit and opportunity provide the basis for a competitive, future-looking nation. America cannot lead the next century without including all of its people.
Second, federal and state governments must address racial and equality grievances so that law enforcement and justice systems are effective, fair, and inclusive. The African American community must have confidence that these systems are credible and safe. An improved justice system can then serve as the foundation for economic development and prosperity.
Third, the United States must be better prepared for a complex, multi-risk future. James Madison said it best when he wrote in Federalist 41 that “America united with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat.” Our nation simply cannot adequately confront emergent military and other geo-political challenges without the cohesion and integrity of equality from enlisted to senior officer ranks. Anything less than equality papers over long-standing American fissures and leaves us susceptible to foreign manipulation.

Fourth, America historically has had a deep well of influential power. Future threats will require that the United States build a more inclusive diplomatic corps to attract allies and put adversaries on notice. A diverse diplomatic core would illustrate American commitment to strengthening our bonds with scores of nations. Further, the United States can deploy intelligence agencies that draw from all corners of society to present a more nuanced counter to Russian and Chinese espionage threats. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has acknowledged that “to be successful against increasingly complex global threats, the intelligence community  must employ and develop a dynamic, agile workforce that reflects diversity in its broadest context and includes all aspects that make individuals unique and America strong.” The future requires that we diversify influential power today.
In 1968 Martin Luther King, Jr., reminded us “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” Black Lives Matters is a clarion call to advance justice, liberty and freedom. The diversity of America is its strength against ethnonationalist states. Bending the arc will help America blunt the challenges from competitors that have no aspirations to be that city upon a hill.

and the Justice Department led by Attorney General William Barr have been laying waste to the rule of law as the election advances toward them. Whether it is the execution of an exit strategy or the groundwork for a second term, the toll is staggering. 
Trump dismissed five inspectors general, all of whom were either critical of the administration or doing their duties to actively investigate alleged misconduct. His former national security adviser John Bolton has clearly accused the president of seeking some assistance from China to win the election. But with the collective outrage rendered numb from countless scandals and the mounting national crises, his relentless obstruction of justice and several efforts to undermine democracy barely register.
With few paying much attention, Barr is flourishing in his execution of an exit strategy for Trump. Without any apparent sense of ethical obligation, Barr has harmed the independent reputation for the Justice Department. Any notion that the Justice Department must defend the interests of the United States without fear or favor are nakedly exposed. This president, his administration, and his attorney general will allow those interests of Trump to supersede or contradict the interests of the United States.
One need only recall the last few months to see a pattern. There was the politically motivated dismissal of the charges against Michael Flynn after the former national security adviser pleaded guilty to those charges. The move was not long after the equally politically motivated interference in the sentencing for Roger Stone. The Justice Department embarrassingly overruled the line prosecutors in an effort to secure a much more lenient sentence for the consultant and campaign adviser of the president.
Those inexplicable legal maneuvers gave rise to this new deep skepticism surrounding the even more embarrassingly botched recent removal of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. There can be no benefit of the doubt given to Barr for suddenly dismissing a prosecutor overseeing criminal investigations into the president, his business entities, and of course their myriad of questionable financial entanglements.
Under any evidentiary standard, the conduct exhibited is intentional and ongoing. However, none of these actions takes place in a vacuum. These are dark days for the efforts of the president to win a second term. While there is still time for Trump to recover, the idea that he will serve only one term is growing. Perhaps the professed belief of Barr in an executive that is not only unitary but also supreme over the other branches explains his willingness to subvert all of the decades of independence for the Justice Department to a commander in chief with authoritarian inclinations.
However, the motives for Barr still seem politically motivated. If Trump is president for just one term, then the legal maneuvers are not the advent of an authoritarian takeover but of a calculated exit strategy to purge the record of a corrupt administration on its last legs. Any investigations that started under Trump may continue past the election if another president follows. But if they can be quashed now, the mood of reconciliation and peace may convince the next administration to leave the past alone.

If the president does manage to pull off another victory, this exit strategy converts seamlessly into a second term. With that scenario, the president has set his most loyal lieutenants into positions where he is vulnerable for legal attack. If the rule of law is to be redeemed, the responsibility falls to the career men and women of the Justice Department, who have to take a stand against the lawlessness of its leaders, as the Assistant United States Attorney Aaron Zelinsky, one of four prosecutors who quit the Stone case in protest of politically motivated interference, did with his testimony.
The restoration of Justice Department honor has to come from within. The men and women who comprise the institution, as well as the next attorney general, must restore their steadfast commitment to the Constitution.

and Republicans. It was evident that his endorsements down the ballot did not carry the same weight as they had in previous races. Trump, who has frequently touted his strong record of endorsements in primary elections for Congress, had numerous political setbacks as Republicans snubbed his choices at the ballot box.
This presents a challenge for Trump and the party moving forward as his influence among Republicans wanes. This is a problem for Trump in light of the fact that moderate Republicans have defected from him lately, and a number of prominent party leaders have publicly rebuked him for being divisive and reckless. One of the most remarkable upsets for Republicans was in the 11th district of North Carolina in the party contest for the seat formerly held by the White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.
Political newcomer Madison Cawthorn defeated Lynda Bennett, who had been chosen by Meadows and endorsed by Trump. Cawthorn positioned himself as the leader of a generation of conservative politicians who can take on the young members of Congress on the progressive left, such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. While Cawthorn said in his acceptance speech he did not “believe this election has been a referendum” on the influence of the president, but it has become clear that the endorsement by Trump in these critical down ballot races do not have the same sway.
In the 4th district of Kentucky, incumbent Thomas Massie won with almost 90 percent of the vote in the face of opposition from the president. Trump called Massie a “disaster for America” and a “third rate grandstander” after he opposed the first coronavirus relief bill. Trump went so far as to call for Massie to be ousted by Republicans. The defeat of Bennett and the victory of Massie are clear rebukes of the president in his own party.
This is a challenge for Trump, as nearly 60 percent of voters disapprove of the job he is doing as president, according to a Marist Poll. Further, Trump trails Joe Biden in the general election by 8 points. While there are several undeniable hurdles for Trump and Republicans, the primary elections for Democrats indicate there are also opportunities. Some liberal Democrats performed better than expected against their strongly backed moderate opponents, a sign of the progressive insurgence in the party.
Positively for Republicans, the leftward movement of Democrats may lead to greater pressure on party leaders to embrace more liberal policies that are unpopular in a general election, including defunding the police, more unfettered immigration advocacy, and a possible wealth tax. This leftward movement was evident up in the 16th district of New York, where political newcomer Jamaal Bowman campaigned on a social justice platform and beat House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel.
This was also the case in the race in Kentucky to nominate the Democrat that will challenge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Progressive candidate Charles Booker is close to defeating establishment candidate Amy McGrath, who has been endorsed by prominent Democrats, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. If the party will embrace radical policies in response to these primary results, it will create an opening for Trump to gain ground with moderate voters and for Republicans to take back vulnerable seats across swing districts they lost in 2018.
Trump: Election results could be delayed by months
Five primary races to watch on Tuesday
Some Republicans who lost in swing districts in the midterm elections two years ago won their party nominations last week and are set for rematches against incumbent Democrats. Indeed, Democrats must defend a number of swing districts which they won in 2018, such as the 11th district of New York, where Republican Nicole Malliotakis won her primary race last week and will challenge Democratic incumbent Max Rose in the fall.
There is a clear opportunity for Trump and Republicans to succeed in the general election this fall if Democrats continue the leftward movement in response to the progressive surge in the party. But Republicans also face the clear challenge of uniting their party around an unpopular president, especially as his approval ratings slip and his influence wanes.

Chaos and confusion may have worked in 2016 when the country was not in the midst of a historic pandemic and economic downturn. This will not work this time around. After these last few years of uncomfortable family dinners, awkward conversations with coworkers, and irreparably broken friendships, Americans are exhausted and want someone boring.
This race is not over, but it is trending in favor of the Democrats. Indeed, the White House response to the coronavirus crisis has turned a toss up election into a potential runaway victory for Joe Biden
. The numbers for Trump with older Americans and women with college degrees are rather devastating. He does not have the benefit of the doubt this time around, and he is actually motivating people to vote against him this fall.
Americans do not blame the president for the outbreaks of the pandemic across the country. No one could have predicted the horrors that we have seen. But many Americans believe that his failures early on exacerbated a bad situation. The crisis and the death toll did not have to be this terrible. That is why Biden is breaking away across several swing states.
The coronavirus has also exposed the inequities of our economic system. Those who could afford to shelter in place or drive to their beach homes were better protected than those who were on the front lines, delivering our groceries, stocking the shelves, and driving taxis. After 2008, we saw a populist movement rise up and demand change. That movement led to the Tea Party, the rise of Bernie Sanders, then President Trump
.
No one should be surprised to see a blending of the populist movement. Supporters on both sides of the aisle are tired of always getting screwed over as many donors and executives receive favors. Americans are sick of having to sacrifice their Social Security, their health care, and their taxes, while the rich continue to get bailed out by Washington insiders.

The coronavirus may have started the polling death spiral for Trump, but his violent response to protesters is what is tanking his election chances. He is not making this country great. It is why Trump is under water in red states like Texas and Arizona. It is why members of the military and of the faith community have condemned his authoritarian response to peaceful protesters. It is why suburban women are starting to abandon him. Trump is so bad at his job that George Bush is now looked at favorably.
We have a president who does not just embrace authoritarian tendencies, but he has brought them to the streets of our cities. The Biden campaign is doing exactly what it should be doing, which is allowing the protesters to have their voices heard. This awakening is bigger than the candidates. The Biden campaign knows that truth. Americans of all stripes are taking to the streets because it is time for a change. This election does not look like it will be a repeat of 2016. I do not see a world where Democrats take their foot off the gas until they win. The stakes here are too high.

A high ranking federal official accepts luggage, tickets to sporting events, scholarships for a girlfriend, and other gifts worth about $35,000. Two state officials closed all but one lane on a bridge into New York during rush hour as retaliation against a politician who did not back the governor.
Most citizens would rightly consider these unacceptable acts of public corruption. Surely these abuses of trust from citizens would bring about swift punishment, but not according to the Supreme Court. In each case, and in many other examples, the conviction was overturned.
Take the most recent public corruption case. Last month, the Supreme Court overturned those convictions in the Bridgegate scandal. In doing so, the justices wrote that “the evidence the jury heard no doubt shows wrongdoing” of deception, corruption, abuse of power but “the federal fraud statutes at issue do not criminalize all such conduct.”
So how is this possible? While the Supreme Court found these acts of corruption legal, it has suggested that federal fraud laws could prohibit “schemes that defraud citizens of their intangible rights to honesty and impartial government.” But that is not what the current laws say, leaving prosecutors without the tools to successfully bring charges.
Each of these cases unleashed a domino effect, resulting in an often swift series of blows that have helped erode our statutes against corruption in the United States. It has made it more difficult to protect the public from officials who violate their trust. But while these Supreme Court decisions may have overlooked the spirit of why such laws exist in the first place, the failure of the laws ultimately rests on the legislative branch.
Congress has never bothered to amend the fraud statute or any of the other public corruption laws that allowed such violations of public trust. But we are not defenseless as a nation. We do not have to accept acts of corruption that occur “for no reason other than political payback” that prevent an ambulance from reaching a victim of a heart attack.
One possible solution, the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act, was originally sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy and Senator John Cornyn, was repeatedly introduced and even passed the upper chamber. The bill would plug many of the holes uncovered by the Supreme Court, however, it has not been reintroduced since the 112th Congress.

It is unconscionable that the corruption laws in this country have been allowed to be eroded with impunity, in full view of the American people. This further highlights the broken status quo that fuels apathy, distrust, and rightful anger among so many across the United States.
It is unacceptable for many members of Congress to simply shrug their shoulders. Congress has a constitutional role to provide for the general welfare of our democracy. Holding our public officials accountable for violating public trust is integral to doing this. It is time to seize on the bipartisan recognition of and outrage over these problems.

0,06/24/20 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/504392-the-next-steps-in-libya,The next steps in Libya,"There has been mildly encouraging news out of Libya in recent months, almost nine years after the overthrow of Muammar Qaddafi led to chaos rather than an improvement in governance and stability. The international community has ignored many chances to help the country get back on its feet. Now it has another opportunity that should not be squandered, lest a humanitarian tragedy ensue, and Libya once again becomes a gateway of numerous refugees streaming into Europe, as well as extremists making their way to the conflicts of the broader Middle East region.
The immediate reasons for this renewed opportunity come from a series of military setbacks by the forces of Khalifa Hafter and his Libyan National Army, which is essentially one large militia operating out of strongholds in the east. Last spring, Hafter and his forces moved south then west, taking much of the country, including the central regions where oil is produced, ultimately knocking on the door of the capital of Tripoli, a city otherwise generally spared of the fighting until then. Haftar benefited from Russian mercenaries and United Arab Emirates airpower, and quieter assistance from countries such as Egypt, France, and Saudi Arabia.
Fortunately, various militias operating in support of the Government of National Accord, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj and blessed by the United Nations, have managed to push Haftar back, first out of the city center, then out of nearby strongholds, and now entirely out of the west. The situation is still fluid, to be sure, and Russian warplanes have been seen in the country, raising the prospect of an escalation. With material assistance from Turkey, however, the tide has now turned.
Libya again resembles what had been the norm for a number of years, with a well intentioned but weak government effectively controlling only parts of Tripoli, various militias dominating in one city or another, some oil flowing with production, and the population generally managing to scrape by, at least more so than people in other war torn Middle East lands such as Yemen and Syria can. This means there is an opportunity.
Tracking a similar state of affairs in 2018 as part of a working group led by the Brookings Institution, we advocated a form of governance based on cities for Libya. Rather than a strong central state with its own powerful military, we favored effectively stitching the country together piece by piece from the ground up. Militias and other local power brokers that tolerated outside observers, minimized use of violence, and provided security or services to local populations would, under this concept, qualify for a prorated share of the oil revenue in Libya.
An oversight board composed of Libyans as well as outside technical experts would make the determinations about who qualifies for such funding, and who should be at least temporarily docked from some of it based on bad behavior. A United Nations observation force could also deploy to the country in small numbers, not to keep the peace, but to report on violations and thus incentivize the militias to keep the peace between themselves and within the areas they control.
The situation in Libya does not suggest that all armed groups in the area can lay down their weapons. Their existence is not only a phenomenon related to power. It goes much deeper. Young men, without a state grid capable of giving them a critical citizenship dimension, have found their economic and social realization in the militias, a sense of belonging that will be difficult to unhinge. Over time, this system could evolve into a set of municipal governments and small armies or paramilitaries that would then join the coast guard as a truly national security service. The effort would happen from the bottom up and not the top down.

But there are some problems. Haftar may not yet have accepted his return to a regional power broker in just part of Libya. If he is hatching plans to retake much or all of the country again, he will have to be stopped. But the challenge is that this kind of idea is not going to emerge from the Libyans themselves. There is not enough trust, and there are too many disparate actors, all of whom are relatively weak. None except perhaps Sarraj are in a position to request the economic and security assistance, along with a United Nations observation force, that would most likely be needed for such a concept of recovery and reunification.
At a time of uncertainty at home and abroad, and with diplomatic efforts from North Korea to Afghanistan and elsewhere mostly dead in the water, the administration should consider arbitrating a new peace process to promote a vision of cooperation in Libya. The United States more than other parties is still seen by most Libyans as neutral and relatively well intentioned. The moment is ripe to give this problem another try, while being more realistic about what it will take to bring some semblance of order to Libya than other previous efforts have attempted.

Notably, Bolton claims that Trump asked President Xi of China to use economic powers to help him win this election, and offered to assist President Erdogan of Turkey with avoiding a criminal investigation into one of its state banks.
These are shocking revelations that raise questions over how Trump has conducted himself, and they highlight the foreign policy challenges that remain unresolved in light of what Bolton tells about China, among other things. Regardless of criticism Bolton is receiving from some politicians, his claims should not be dismissed or ignored, as they fulfill the broader pattern of behavior by Trump of not handling foreign policy well.
Yet it is unclear whether the revelations will move the political needle one way or the other. They certainly have the power to distract from the White House agenda, especially if Trump spends time excoriating Bolton instead of focusing on policy issues. Further, the book could make it more difficult for Trump to consolidate Republican voters, now that a leading traditional conservative has accused him of repeatedly using powers of his office to court favors from our adversaries and undercut national interests.

This has resulted in charges against the four police officers, but that does nothing to compensate his family for their losses. Only the civil justice system can do that.
House Democrats have introduced a bill dealing with police misconduct, including a provision that would scale back with the defense of qualified immunity, which almost always enables police accused of conduct such as that used with Floyd to avoid paying damages for their wrongful acts. The Supreme Court also has several pending cases for which victims of wrongful acts by the government are asking the justices to modify that doctrine, which the Supreme Court itself had founded more than three decades ago. Such efforts have great intentions, but they will not solve the problem because, while they might enable the plaintiffs to win their cases, they will do nothing to assure they recover their losses.
The case of Floyd significantly illustrates the problem. Even if the qualified immunity defense were eliminated entirely, and his family were to obtain a judgment against the four police officers, they could still not collect more than a tiny fraction of it. While law enforcement officials are paid decently, they do not have money to pay awards running upward in the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Further, this assumes that the defendants have not been fired or are not serving lengthy sentences for their criminal conduct. The Civil Rights Act of 1871, under which cases of this kind have been brought, precludes governments that employ the offending officers from getting held financially responsible in cases like this one.
Fortunately, Congress would be able to solve this problem by amending the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and make the employers of law enforcement officers liable for the misdeeds of their employees to the same extent as private employers could be held liable for their workers. If a department store security officer used unreasonable force in detaining a suspected shoplifter, the store owner would have to pay the damages awarded at trial, with no defense like qualified immunity available to use.
That is already the rule for federal law enforcement officers. The Tort Claims Act of 1946 was primarily enacted to make the United States responsible for routine tort cases, such as negligence of postal truck drivers. There was initially an exclusion for most forms of intentional misconduct by federal agents. In 1971, the Supreme Court found that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents could be held liable for, in this case, violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of the person whose home they unlawfully entered in the course of an investigation.
Then three years later, Congress recognized that the United States must defend those cases and pay for the damages of any claim that arises “out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution,” if conducted by someone “empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of federal law.” So if a Drug Enforcement Administration agent killed Floyd during the process of arresting him, his family could have successfully sued the United States, without any qualified immunity defense.

To remedy the qualified immunity problem, Congress must not tinker with the doctrine, but instead amend the law to provide that the employer of a law enforcement officer whose conduct has involved assault, battery, false arrest, abuse of process, or a malicious prosecution is liable to any person who is injured by that conduct and that the defense of qualified immunity is not available to the employer. Local governments will doubtless cry that this law would cost them considerable money, but that begs the question of who must bear the loss. Should it be the victim or the city?
Moreover, some companies are happy to sell municipal liability insurance to those entities that choose not to insure themselves, just like they sell it to private businesses that employ security guards and others who may be prone to commit those same types of wrongful acts. The need for cultural changes in the attitudes and practices of our society cannot be doubted, but Congress cannot legislate them. It can, however, solve the qualified immunity problem today. So what are lawmakers waiting for?

might be the luckiest person in politics. Despite endless gaffes and awkward encounters, he became the Democratic nominee following several candidates dropping out and the implosion of the Bernie Sanders campaign. Biden had another major boost with the coronavirus lockdown. Stuck at home, some of his worst qualities, including degraded language skills, a tendency to pick fights with his supporters, and his dubious track record, became hidden from the public. However, with restrictions being lifted across many states, his weakness will be laid bare.
Before the lockdowns, his campaign was flailing. Biden seemed to make it a point to stick his foot in his mouth at every available opportunity. Do you remember when he called a voter a “damn liar” in Iowa? Or when he oddly asserted that 150 million people have died from gun violence over the last 13 years? While these incidents might seem like forever ago with all that is going on in the country, they shaped the poor public perception of Biden before the coronavirus took the spotlight away from him.
With the lockdowns ending, Biden will lose his advantage of staying out of the spotlight. He will have to transition from interviews with friendly hosts, conducted from his home in Delaware where aides could carefully control optics, to the unpredictable style of town halls. Without any handlers able to manage every moment, his loose tongue or instigative attitude toward voters threaten to define the remainder of his campaign.
Biden still had blunders over the last few months that would have made headline news during normal times but were quickly forgotten amid the pandemic reports. Honorable mentions include when he asserted black Trump supporters are not really black, stated just 85,000 jobs were lost due to the coronavirus but millions had died, and appeared to fall asleep during a virtual town hall with Hillary Clinton. Such faux pas will become more frequent as Biden is forced into public and will do greater political damage with a news cycle more focused on the election.
The shifting news cycle will also place his track record under increased scrutiny, most notably his pivotal role writing the disastrous 1994 crime bill. His tough on crime overhaul may be considered common sense to moderates, but the protests reveal what a political liability it is among Democrats today. The bill raised police funding and was so strict that Biden said it did it all except “hang people for jaywalking.”
While the lockdowns allowed Biden to hide his all greatest flaws, they also prevented Donald Trump
from using his greatest strengths. The president is at his best in front of energized crowds at his massive rallies. Due to the coronavirus, he has not utilized his most potent tool just yet. However, the reinvigoration of the Trump campaign through its heavily attended events will serve as a reminder of the reasons why he won four years ago. His first rally since the start of the pandemic will be next weekend.
The very stark comparison between Biden and Trump, both in their 70s, only belies the fact that they are less than five years apart. The speaking ability of Biden will be highlighted as the race wears on him. Humiliating mistakes and numerous “senior moments” might hand not only general voters, but perhaps hardcore Democrats, cause for concern, especially when contrasted with the energy and stamina from Trump.

As November draws closer, expect the Biden campaign to continue using the pandemic as a reason to reduce his visibility and liability, especially at the party convention, which will likely be sparsely populated compared to previous election cycles. Democrats could even try to avoid a live debate with Trump by citing the pandemic. This would then allow Biden to speak mostly with scripted comments and surrounded by his staff.
Trump is not out of the woods. His approval fell below 40 percent in some polls, and there is plenty of time to make his own errors. But we have seen a race between Trump and another Democratic candidate who struggled before. Biden could hide behind the effects of the coronavirus. While the country moves on, his campaign may act too slowly to fight the fact that Biden has been the only American to benefit from the crisis.

The answer is the Federal Reserve. In most democracies when the pandemic began, the government did not have the broad ability to halt the rapidly deteriorating economic situation. A vacuum of leadership developed in the United States, and the central bank stepped in to fill the void.
The power of the Federal Reserve is based on its credibility, which partly derives from its independent status. While it reports to Congress, it does not rely on the legislative branch for funding, and it earns money from its transactions. The president, with the consent of the Senate, appoints the chairman, yet the term does not coincide with the president. The central bank is not allowed to be involved overseas or have offices based outside the United States. Its main job is the dual mandate to protect the stability of the dollar and to maximize employment with monetary policy.
Neither of those have anything to do with supporting the economies of other countries amid a crisis. But you can stretch the mandate to mean that in a world where a crisis as devastating as the coronavirus happens, supporting other economies is also protecting the stability of the dollar and maintaining employment in the United States. This is now what the Federal Reserve has been doing in the downturn by taking international responsibility and filling the void where no other institution exists.
The Federal Reserve started making dollars available to the central banks of other countries. Since the majority of world trade is done in dollars, the Federal Reserve had to make dollars easily available, as it received foreign currencies in exchange and charged interest on these transactions. It has also cut the rate it charges on those interactions with the central banks in numerous countries and extended their maturity. This program was used amid the Great Recession, however, it was nowhere near this level.
So the Federal Reserve went far beyond its dual mandate, acting while the administration and Congress dithered. As Chairman Jerome Powell stated about preventing the economy from diving into free fall, “When it comes to lending, we are not going to run out of ammunition.” Over two months, the Federal Reserve sent more than $2 trillion into the domestic economy, twice the amount that it used after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
It is as though the mandate of maximizing employment gives the Federal Reserve the power to take any monetary action to fill that power vacuum left by the government. Take the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York. The financial situation swiftly declined as the pandemic caused ridership to drop near zero. A bill had been introduced in Congress to help states fund such problems, however, it became a political football with the Senate majority leader refusing to support it. But as Congress was bitterly fighting, the Federal Reserve allowed states to designate their mass transit systems so they can raise funds by selling debt to the central bank.

There is no doubt that the coronavirus would have caused much greater hardship if it were not for the extraordinary actions taken by the Federal Reserve. But what does that mean for the future? In the United States, it becomes very easy during any emergency for democratic institutions to give power to a supposedly neutral institution. Yet who gets voted out if the central bank makes a bad decision or is involved in a scandal?
On the world stage, the Federal Reserve takes on a totally undefined role. There has never been an international conference that has granted it this power, and there are no outside shareholders in the Federal Reserve. For the veiled area of central banks, it is assumed that if a crisis occurs, the Federal Reserve will act forthrightly. It will be the global fireman putting out fires that the common citizen does not understand, which is what it has done this time. But what if it does not act as wisely next time?

Last week, Fox News revealed Joe Biden
leading by 9 points above Donald Trump
in battleground Wisconsin. In 2016, Trump won the critical state by less than 1 point. This week, CNN found Biden leading by 14 points among registered voters nationwide. These Fox News and CNN polls align with other live interview polls this month with Biden ahead by an average of 10 points. As I used to declare when my beloved New York Mets scored a run in the top of the first inning, game over.
But as we learned in 2016, this game is never over if Trump is playing. At this time four years ago, Hillary Clinton was leading Trump by 10 points in a Reuters poll, by 7 points in a Monmouth University poll, and by 4 points in a CNN poll. In Wisconsin, she was leading by 8 points in a Public Policy Polling survey. Then the bombshell of misogynist comments by Trump in the Access Hollywood tapes hit. Right after this, Clinton was up 11 points nationwide, 12 points in Michigan, 7 points in Wisconsin, and 5 points in Florida. Then one month later, Trump was elected president.
So it turns out that credible 2016 polls were not wrong. They consistently reflected a significant lead for Clinton with the popular vote and showed races too close to call for battleground states. The recent Fox News and CNN polls do signal trouble for Trump this year, but have we not learned about his abilities to wrestle or tweet his way out of anything?
Trump faces a perfect storm, although I must say he is the only politician I know who can turn a Category 1 storm into a Category 5 hurricane. His job approval has fallen due to his handling of the coronavirus and the George Floyd killing, along with anxiety over the economy. In the Fox News poll in Wisconsin, his support among Republican voters is declining, something I never imagined I would witness. In the CNN poll, Trump is trailing slightly with his base, while Biden is picking up quickly with his own.
In fact, the Trump base strategy is not working right now. As Harry Enten writes, “The candidate who is employing a base first strategy is actually finding it is that other candidate who is doing better with his own base.” Biden supporters can be heartened by one other dynamic, which is that the polling average holds him above 50 percent on a consistent basis, a number that Clinton never had at this stage in the campaign.
Will this Biden surge propel him to the Oval Office? It is as powerful as a stiff breeze, and we all know how quickly climates can change. There are reasons for cautious optimism that the economy will not fall into another deep depression. Like everything else, Trump will take full credit for that, even though it was Democrats in Congress who pushed for the effective financial relief bills for the middle class and working families.

We do not know what other national security or foreign policy crises, real or spun, may dominate the thinking of voters as we approach the election this fall. Then there is the most unpredictable but significant influence on the election. This is what David Axelrod calls the “feral instinct” of Trump. When his back is to the alley wall he turns rabid. We may believe that we have seen it all, but Trump always takes us below and beyond.
I am a strong and involved supporter of Biden. But I know that no matter where the polls are, we underestimate the capacity of the Trump team to do what it must in order to win, not just at the peril of Biden, but perhaps also to America. This is not the time for complacency or overconfidence for Democrats, no matter how much Fox News and CNN agree.

0,06/07/20 10:30 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/501522-as-the-economy-recovers-republicans-and-democrats-will-play-different-roles,"As the economy recovers, Republicans and Democrats will play different roles","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted American life in unprecedented ways. Yet all pandemics eventually come to an end, and so too will this one. When the economy begins to rebound it will rely on pent-up consumer demand to drive the recovery.
So, are consumers ready to spend? Who will spend more than normal, and on what?
Data collected from a nationwide sample of 1,151 Americans during early May 2020 paint a fascinating picture — and reveal that partisanship helps explain both how consumers are feeling during the pandemic and how they plan to behave after it.
The data illustrate the difficult realities confronting most Americans: About 95 percent of respondents were under lockdown at the time of surveying. Some 16 percent had been laid-off, furloughed, or were unemployed. Nearly 42 percent said their income has decreased since the pandemic began. About 78 percent are currently working from home, compared to 37 percent before the pandemic.
However, consumers’ emotional response to the adversity differs greatly between political parties. Republicans express greater anxiety, stress, and powerlessness than Democrats. For example, 38 percent of Republicans reported being either “quite a bit” or “extremely” anxious, compared to 29 percent of Democrats; 41 percent of Republicans reported being either “quite a bit” or “extremely” stressed, compared to 32 percent of Democrats, and 37 percent of Republicans reported feeling either “quite a bit” or “extremely” powerless, compared to 28 percent of Democrats.
Although Republicans are more negatively impacted emotionally by the pandemic, they also express greater positivity about the future. While 34 percent of Democrats reported being either “quite a bit” or “extremely” hopeful, this leapt to 49 percent among Republicans. Only 40 percent of Democrats reported being either “quite a bit” or “extremely” optimistic, compared to 50 percent of Republicans. These differences are all statistically significant.
Will these varying emotional responses to the pandemic across partisan groups translate to different shopping behaviors? Are Democrats and Republicans likely to exhibit “politicized consumerism?”
You bet.
We first asked the respondents what they would spend $1,000 on if they received it unexpectedly. Democrats indicated they would spend just over half ($514) on savings or on paying debts and bills. Republicans, on the other hand, reported they would spend almost two thirds ($613) on purchasing and various outlays.
Republicans, in short, may represent a bigger share of the consumer dollars flowing into the economy by purchasing goods, rather than saving and paying down debt. This greater desire to consume things may be driven by the greater stress, anxiety, and powerlessness Republicans are experiencing.
We also asked each respondent the first thing they would buy or do when the pandemic begins to slow or comes to an end. While the responses were open-ended — and thus varied widely — the two most common goods mentioned by Democrats were restaurant and vacation. By contrast, the two most common goods mentioned by Republicans were food and clothes.
Democrats, it seems, may be more interested in experiences post-pandemic, while Republicans are more focused on everyday purchases. More detailed data confirms this assumption.
Perhaps because of the high anxiety and stress Republicans are experiencing, they appear eager to spend more than Democrats on necessities such as household items (39 percent vs. 29 percent), health and personal care items (36 percent vs. 23 percent), food to consume at home (39 percent vs. 30 percent), and utilities (32 percent vs. 21 percent). 
In addition, and again probably as a coping mechanism to ease their emotional turmoil, Republicans (44 percent) are more eager than Democrats (28 percent) to spend on luxury goods like jewelry and electronics after the pandemic as well as on telecommunications such as cable TV and streaming services (33 percent vs. 21 percent).
In a rare show of unity, Democrats and Republicans expect to spend at roughly equal levels (“somewhat more” or “much more”) on restaurants and bars, clothing and apparel, travel and leisure, and entertainment and events (concerts, sports events). So, politicized consumerism will be more active in some consumer industries, such as health and personal care items, than in others, such as showing support for local restaurants and bars.
As we look toward the post-pandemic economic recovery, it will be important to track not only how quickly it happens, but also which consumers are driving it. Understanding which consumers are most likely to spend, and on what, will help companies serve these customers. It will also help policymakers forecast the recovery’s trajectory.
Our data show that consumer spending will be unequally distributed across partisan lines, and that Republicans may contribute a larger share of this spending. Democrats, on the other hand, may be quicker to get on airplanes for vacations and to flock to restaurants.

What if we never let the coronavirus get to the point it has? What if the U.S had appropriate healthcare infrastructure in place to combat a virus as serious as COVID-19? What if Donald Trump
was not the one responsible for leading America out of the nation's worst economic crisis since the Great Depression? America can no longer survive on ""what-ifs."" It will survive solely on action, collaboration, and believe it or not, the U.S Postal Service. 
There's no denying that Americans feel hopeless, running scenes in our heads about what might have been or could be our future. And to keep ourselves sane and engaged while sheltered indoors, we are looking for every bit of light at the end of the tunnel — to regain even the simplest sense of control. 
The good thing is — we have more control than we think. At home, in our lives, on the internet, we have all the power we could ever need to affect the future of our most sacred right as Americans — your right to vote. 
We've seen how the coronavirus has brought America to a grinding halt and with it the majority of in-person voter mobilization efforts. The progressive movement, which typically reaches its full potential in the months leading up to November, is now sitting at home, waiting for the all-clear to resume the usual canvassing, phone banking, and general voter outreach activities.
However, we don't have time to waste. Donald Trump is actively pressuring states to restrict voting opportunities and preparing to deploy 50,000 ""poll watchers"" to suppress the vote of communities most likely to vote against him. So, to counter his efforts, we started Vote From Home 2020 to harness progressive momentum across the country and connect swing-state voters with vote-by-mail applications and ballots in the 2020 general election.
The initiative provides organizers and volunteers the digital and remote organizing tools they need to stay engaged by connecting voters in communities most vulnerable to voter disenfranchisement with vote-by-mail applications and ballots.  
We want to start with voters in key swing states like Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania; states that allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without needing an excuse, but historically have meager rates of voters using this option, have the right to vote by mail amid a global pandemic properly. 
Looking back, only 10.7 percent of voters in Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania voted by mail in 2016 and now, for the first time, every voter in these states has the opportunity to request a ballot without an excuse. Meanwhile, states such as Oregon, Colorado, Washington, Utah, and Hawaii conduct almost all of their elections by mail and have some of the highest voter turnout rates in the entire country.
The progressive movement is being challenged now more than ever to harness the grassroots momentum that every progressive campaign and operation depends on. Prioritizing outreach to communities of color and young voters in swing states to ensure they have the tools to participate in our democracy will be the upper hand the movement has been looking for.
Vote From Home 2020, powered by grassroots volunteers, will mail voters absentee ballot applications, instructions for filling them out, messaging on why voting by mail is safe and important, and pre-paid return postage for the application. 
A strong vote-by-mail organizing operation will be a show of force that we still have civic good left in this country. It will require us to rally and to collaborate and come together in an unprecedented time when our national belief in our ability to do so is exceptionally low. 
Vote-by-mail is not a one and done solution to the raging voter disenfranchisement rooted in America's election system, but it's a start. Research shows that the likelihood of voter participation increases by up to 7 percent of voters are urged to vote by mail. Additionally, like Vote From Home 2020 commits to doing, reminding voters up to two times to return their ballot increases the probability of voting by 4 percent.

Individuals and groups opposed to state and local efforts which are designed to blunt the renewed spread of the pandemic will be ready with legal challenges. States, in defending the next round of orders, will be able to point to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.
Roberts appended a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court denial of an injunction in the case of South Bay United Pentecostal Church versus Gavin Newsom. It concerned a California emergency order that placed a temporary numerical restriction on public gatherings in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. State guidelines at the time had restricted large public gatherings of people “in close proximity for extended periods of time,” including music concerts, university lectures, movie screenings, spectator sports, theater performances, and places of worship.
In his opinion, Roberts explained that the First Amendment posed no bar to the emergency order because the state subjected similar secular and sectarian activities to identical restrictions, placing no particular burden on religious gatherings. Roberts recognized that governors are facing an unprecedented public health crisis, a situation poorly suited to second guesses by federal judges who lack the “background, competence, and expertise” to assess efforts to address the emergency situation.
This reasoning should prevail in most cases where individuals seek to use constitutional rights protections as a means to undermine the efficacy of emergency orders aimed at halting the spread of a disease for which, as Roberts noted, we have no known cure, vaccine, or effective treatment. His lesson for governors, for whom it is not too early to be thinking of a next potential wave of the pandemic, is to draft emergency restrictions that treat constitutional rights protections the same as others.
The current medical thinking is that the disease spreads most readily the more time people are indoors, close together, and with someone who is infected. It follows that states should seek to limit gatherings at places and situations where people are likely to be together for long periods of time, regardless of the nature of the event. The coronavirus, after all, will not discriminate between music concerts and church services.
If the government treats all places and situations in the same way, then individuals cannot claim the state discriminates against constitutional interests as a wedge to undermine emergency orders. If Massachusetts had the benefit of the opinion of Roberts in the case of South Bay United Pentecostal Church when the state defended its emergency order which treats gun shops the same as all similar nonessential businesses in federal district court, perhaps the court would not have concluded that the order had imposed an “improper burden” on the Second Amendment rights of citizens who were seeking to buy firearms and ammunition.

There is little doubt that treating gun shops as nonessential businesses served to promote the key public interest in the health of Massachusetts residents. When the court had finally held a hearing on the request for an injunction, thousands of Massachusetts residents were infected and the coronavirus had claimed more than 4,000 lives. To flatten the curve and slow the spread, the state had to reduce potential vectors where it could. Even conditions the court ultimately approved, such as masks and social distancing, could not eliminate gun shops as vectors in the same way as preventing contact, as with other nonessential businesses.
At the end of the day, the concurring opinion by the chief justice in the case of South Bay United Pentecostal Church suggests an important role for the federal judiciary in the midst of the pandemic that today seems to be imbued as it is with modesty and appropriate deference to state and local officials who must, under the constitutional system in this country, bear the responsibility for keeping citizens safe and healthy.

While most residents are eager to resume their lives, New York does not have final strategic guidelines or any systematic approach that will help us to avoid the feared second wave of coronavirus infections. If we are to reopen safely, then we have to start by introducing sensible guidelines based on our knowledge of the coronavirus to date in order to prevent a second wave of infections and avoid the need for stay home orders or business closures during the recovery in the future.
We know that the coronavirus has not mutated over the last three months, meaning that its biology, lethality, and transmissibility remain the same as when the lockdowns started. We know that more than 10 percent of New York residents are antibody positive, meaning that they have overcome the coronavirus and are presumably immune to reinfection. This would offer limited protection for those who have not been infected, but this alone is certainly insufficient to prevent a second wave of infections.
What sets this disease apart from the other coronavirus strains over the past century, which were both significantly deadlier, is the fact that this coronavirus has many asymptomatic carriers, making it a larger invisible world threat than the Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Before New York starts its process to reopen, it is absolutely critical to identify these asymptomatic carriers so that we can prevent or at least dramatically reduce the spread. In doing this, we can prevent a second wave that is more devastating than the first wave.
Given that we know some people are more vulnerable to the coronavirus than others, only those individuals under the age of 65 years old with no significant medical issues should be allowed to enter society at this time. These individuals could provide the labor force needed to allow the more vulnerable to stay at home while still enabling the critical recovery in the economy. Those over the age of 65 or those who are younger and have significant medical issues should not enter society if at all possible until there is a vaccine or an effective treatment that is widely available.
There are several misperceptions as to when and how people can safely enter society without risking exposure to the coronavirus, as the public has been told that most activities can resume as long as precautions are taken, despite the deadly toll of the coronavirus. The way to clear up this confusion is by continuously expanding testing. Unfortunately, however, we have extraordinarily little data because of limited testing to date.
Individuals who are under the age of 65 with no significant medical issues should be subject to a system of risk stratification, which would be given to those people who enter society with the goal to help these individuals understand their own risk factors. Every New York resident would receive both coronavirus testing, which determines whether one currently has it, as well as antibody testing, which confirms whether one has already had it. Individuals would then be designated as green, meaning safe for entry, yellow, meaning moderate risk of entry, or red, meaning no entry yet.
People who test negative for the coronavirus and positive for the antibody should be designated as green because they can safely enter society and feel reassured that they are not susceptible to getting reinfected with the disease. Further, the individuals who test negative for the coronavirus and negative for the antibody should be designated as yellow and can start to enter society with caution since they are still susceptible to infection.

Individuals who test positive for the coronavirus should be designated as red, should quarantine for two weeks, and should not enter society unless they have had two consecutive negative coronavirus tests 24 hours apart. Moreover, this testing needs to be done at the minimum of once a month, ideally once a week, to determine whether the individual has contracted the coronavirus or has the antibody to guard against future infection.
We cannot prevent a second wave until we identify asymptomatic carriers who might spread the disease and identify all those who can enter society with low risk levels or who are coronavirus negative and antibody positive. To avoid a second wave that could overwhelm the health system, increase the death toll, and create further economic devastation, then we have to impose policies that will protect the most vulnerable and rely heavily on testing to figure out all the various infection risk levels of individuals.

But the key foreign policy matter for the future of the United States is a rising confrontation with China. We are hurtling toward a new cold war with China. President Trump and his administration are eager to attack and demean the Chinese for every problem. He stays so committed to blaming them that he is even willing to withdraw from the World Health Organization in the middle of a major global pandemic.
The Chinese have much to answer regarding how they handled the novel coronavirus and communicated to the world about its significant danger. For many years, China has been a persistent thorn in the side of American businesses through intellectual property theft. The Chinese are enjoying greater power and are pushing around their neighbors, including Hong Kong and American allies like South Korea and Taiwan.
There is almost no upside for Republicans or Democrats to say anything nice about China or to propose any areas where collaboration between the two countries might be productive. Yet in addition to global security issues, there are important areas where American interests coincide. It is critical to work together on climate change, global pandemic responses, science and technology, and key agricultural issues.
Trump understands that beating up on China has some utility, but that is not being a stronger leader. The problem is not figuring out how to make collaboration with China a palatable issue. American voters are skeptical of China as a positive force, and politicians must not try to convince them that they are wrong about this. But responsible politicians have to outline a sensible strategy for engaging with China that still defends American interests while leaving room for less toxic relations.
Trump is unlikely to be responsible for anything, and he certainly cannot be counted on to be responsible for a sensible strategy for China. This is problematic for American farmers. Can we treat China as an enemy and plead with them to buy our agricultural products? Can the Chinese buy our agricultural products and continue to engage in rampant intellectual property theft when they need these food items? Trump has too short an attention span to confront these questions seriously.
Perhaps Joe Biden and the Democrats can offer a path that shows that China has been taking advantage of the international economic system and unfairly tilting the balance of trade, but also shows that the Chinese invest a lot of money in factories and businesses across the country that employ many of our fellow citizens and offer a huge market for American products. We want to compete with the Chinese under an agreed set of rules. We can protect our interests from unfair Chinese actions while still having healthy diplomatic ties with this critical country.

We do not need a conflict with China in these uncertain times. American leaders must temper the rhetoric on both sides and not make the election about who can bash China the hardest. It is time for mature politicians of both parties to recognize the important need to diffuse the problems and work together to solve them. China is the source of some of our problems but not all of them. We have to heal ourselves internally on many fronts, and China cannot be the scapegoat for our challenges.
Responsible politicians must step forward with an actionable strategy for the United States to both work with and confront China on a diverse array of issues. Hearing politicians bashing China might make us feel good, but we should instead use our strengths such as ingenuity and human rights to compete with China and continue to lead the world.

It first seizes us as confusion and anger, underscored with pain and mourning. Then it emerges as an understanding that the path forward cannot look like the one behind us, but it is unclear how to pave the new path. What is clear is that we are all aching to begin anew. It is time for a great reset.
But how does that reset start? Where do we begin rebuilding the nation? How do we include everyone in the process? When a house is collapsing, the first thing to do is shore up the floor joists, upon which everything rests. In our country, those joists are our democracy, the political system by which people have power, and policy is made on their behalf.
Indeed, those joists have been mercilessly hacked at in the last three decades. We have all seen it happen, and much of it has been intentional. The gerrymandering, which carves people, and often communities of color, out of districts so that those in power can continue to hoard it. The overwhelming dominance of money in politics, which hands the policy process to the wealthiest and leaves almost everyone else behind.
The intentional disenfranchisement of black and brown voters through dirty tricks and crafty laws that echo Jim Crow. The autocratic control of both chambers of Congress by the House speaker and the Senate majority leader. The executive branch aggregating power as the legislative branch loses its limbs. The decline of civic learning and the loss of our sense of common purpose as fellow Americans. The creation of two very different narratives about current events through the tribalization of the media.
The result, of course, is the situation we have all come to hate today. It is one marked by gridlock, division, resentment, and legislation crafted by special interests sailing through the legislative process while the public interest drowns in the wake. As hard as it might be to imagine today, there is a venn diagram overlap between certain supporters of President Trump and all those marching in the streets to protest on behalf of Black Lives Matter, a political system that keeps powerless people powerless.
Unless our leaders begin the process of reconstructing and reinventing that political system, we should not expect anything to fundamentally change in the coming years. That is why democracy reform is the most important precondition for national progress at this point in history.
Reverend William Barber, one of the great civil rights leaders of our time, spoke of the death of George Floyd over the weekend. Barber addressed not just the direct physical violence that had killed him, and kills so many like him every year, but also the violence of policy that undermines poor communities across the nation every day. They face a lack of health care, decent incomes, and affordable housing. Unless we fix the violence of policy, Barber said, then we will continue to be “a divided and a deadly and a distorted society.” Unless we fix the violence that has been done to our democracy, the violence of bad policies will not end.
About a year ago, the Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz was asked what it will take to rebuild the middle class in the country. He said, “If we are going to actually achieve the kinds of changes that we need, we are going to have better politics. A concern which I raise is that we have been engaged in processes which entail disenfranchisement, weakening the power of ordinary individuals in the political process, both through gerrymandering and through the power of money, and then weakening some of those systems of checks and balances.”
Watch live: Trump holds press briefing
Most view news media as biased, but critical to democracy: poll
What makes our nation great is, in large part, our grand experiment in government by the people. Getting that experiment right in a way that brings all to the table is the first step on the path to national recovery. It requires the passage of laws that strengthen voting rights, reduce the influence of political money on the policy process, end gerrymandering, and rebuild the institution of Congress. Skipping such an important step means we are bound to stumble with the subsequent ones.
The repercussion of stumbling again could be as high as the cost of losing our country to the darkest undercurrents of human history. But if we can muster the strength and the camaraderie to apply ourselves to the task of reforming and reinventing our democracy, we will have the tools needed as a people to begin fixing the many other problems we face.

This was evidently “racist” and I was demanded to apologize. Even “Saturday Night Live” parodied my reference to her nonviolent protest in the civil rights movement.
But no one bothered to take note that I wrote my college thesis about civil disobedience and our storied tradition of nonviolent protest as the way to redress government injustices. I referenced such heroic leaders as Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Rosa Parks.
I was advising the organizers of the lockdown protests to make sure that they were engaged in safe peaceful assembly by wearing masks and not bringing guns or wearing “Make America Great Again” hats if they really wanted to effect change. I attended some of the rallies and, fortunately, that is what most of those protesters around the country have done.
Now the left has taken to the streets with bricks and molotov cocktails to protest racial injustice. It might have been helpful if someone on the left advised them to imitate Rosa Parks instead of burning and looting many businesses owned by immigrants, spray painting obscenities all over the streets and buildings, and endangering police, who are outnumbered by the mobs and have been courageously trying to keep our cities safe.
Many protesters sadly have not been anything like modern day versions of Rosa Parks. A New York Times opinion columnist over the weekend argued that violence can lead to social change. Consider also the hypocrisy of the mainstream media and liberal intelligentsia on public health. They seethed with contempt over the lockdown protesters for ignoring all the stay home orders and endangering themselves and others. The Washington Post also sneered that their philosophy was “give us liberty and give us death.”
Blue cities are under severe lockdowns ordered by Democratic mayors, with thousands of protesters in the streets, and social distancing is the furthest thing from their minds. But have any mainstream media pundits objected that these protesters could be spreading the coronavirus and endangering themselves and their communities? Apparently, those stay home orders and social distancing requirements apply to the protesters on the right only, while those on the left can ignore its own dictates.

Similarly, many in the media decried the lockdown protesters as “heavily armed” gun nuts waving confederate flags around and organized by the extreme right wing groups. I can attest first hand that this is a deliberate falsification. These protesters were mostly middle class people who lost their jobs, business owners who had to close down, minorities who lost their incomes, and folks who lost their right of religious freedom. While some bad apples participated, they were definitely the exception.
The irony, of course, is that those people armed with weapons were the rioters over the weekend. Now if the mainstream media and Democratic leaders want to play a constructive role, perhaps they could remind the enraged protesters that the great Rosa Parks did more to advance racial equality in America with one act of civil disobedience than those tens of thousands of violent protesters destroying many cities combined.

With the absence of a traditional campaign structure, President Trump
and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden
face a challenge of a digital advertising war in lieu of a basic strategy.
Trump, whose campaign has raised nearly double the cash of Biden, has already outspent the former vice president on advertising by a margin of three to one since Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, according to Advertising Analytics. The finances of the Biden campaign have been less substantial, although advertising in his favor has ramped up with recent support from super political action committees.
Both sides are working to frame different narratives of the crisis through their digital advertising. The Trump campaign has focused on achieving two goals. The first one is making the case that his handling of the crisis resulted in millions of lives getting saved, and the second one is that his leadership is initiating a comeback that will result in a robust rest of the year and a comeback in the economy. Conversely, the Biden campaign has focused on framing the election as a referendum on Trump.
How the competing strategies play out will determine the 2020 election. The Trump campaign seeks to make its case in a digital ad with selective use of audio visuals that touts the coronavirus response of the president, saying it saved two million lives. It also notes that he is leading a historic comeback. It is unclear whether this narrative resonates, with Americans disapproving of his coronavirus response by 12 points, according to new data from Reuters. The comeback argument may be effective if, as Larry Kudlow has predicted, the economy bounces back this summer.
Further, the economy is an area of weakness for Biden, who trails Trump on who voters trust to handle it. To counter the comeback argument, the Biden campaign is running digital attack ads across battleground states on the failed leadership of Trump on the coronavirus, saying it cratered the economy and also resulted in the loss of thousands of lives.
Two ads blame the severity of the public health crisis and downturn in the economy on Trump because of his early inaction, depicting him as frozen when the coronavirus struck. In an effort to level the political playing field, the Trump campaign set out a digital ad blitz hitting Biden on some issues where the president is also vulnerable, including our relations with China. Its lack of transparency and failure to control the outbreak has resulted in broad public sentiment against China here in the United States.

While this could certainly backfire, it might neutralize some vulnerabilities of the president. This negative strategy is rather similar to what the Trump campaign ran in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. Indeed, a recent ad says that Biden defends China and features the former vice president criticizing the travel ban as “hysterical xenophobia.” The ad of course does not show that Trump also praised China and lauded President Xi Jinping on his handling of the outbreak. The Biden campaign attacks Trump for his failures on this key diplomatic issue in a recent ad that features a narrator saying that the president “rolled over for the Chinese” and just “took their word.”
Ultimately, with digital advertising taking on considerable importance in politics this year, the 2020 election will hinge on whether voters believe the Biden campaign narrative that Trump failed as president against the pandemic and the country is now worse off, or whether they believe the Trump campaign narrative that the president mitigated the coronavirus and his leadership is starting a great comeback in the economy.

. This is because of demographic shifts in several states as well as the declining support for President Trump among voters who fueled his win four years ago. But with the uncertain nature of the coronavirus crisis and the economic recovery, there is no clear advantage for Biden. If Trump is able to make a case that he successfully dealt with the current pandemic and set the country on a strong path out of this, then he will no doubt win the election.
Biden holds a narrow edge in swing states. He leads by at least 5 points in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, according to Public Policy Polling. He leads by 4 points in Florida as well, according to Quinnipiac University. The data reveals independents and some moderate Republicans in these states have defected from Trump during the coronavirus crisis.
It is likely that a substantial number of those independents and defected moderate Republicans will drift back to Trump, both in swing states and red states where Trump has lost ground, if he could deliver a convincing economic message. However, his support is still eroding among certain groups in a way that may be difficult to overcome in November.
In Florida, Trump is losing ground with older voters and white voters with a college degree. Biden leads by 10 points with older voters, a group that Trump won by a landslide. Biden leads by 11 points with white voters with a college degree, another group that Trump won by a clear margin. There are some states where these demographic shifts and eroding support for Trump signal the potential of surprising wins for Biden this fall.
This is the case in Arizona, a red state that has trended more blue, where Biden leads by 4 points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. His path to victory in Arizona can be attributed to falling support for Trump among suburban voters and Hispanic voters. To understand this electoral shift in action, look to Maricopa County, a diverse area that includes Phoenix and Scottsdale with a high Hispanic population. Biden now leads by 12 points, despite the fact that Trump won the region by nearly 4 points.
Similarly, there are electoral opportunities for Biden in Georgia and North Carolina, red states that Trump carried four years ago. In Georgia, there is declining support for Trump among suburban voters and a rising swath of registered black voters, who now comprise a third of registered voters for the state, so many believe that Biden can possibly flip Georgia.

In North Carolina, Biden has a narrow advantage in the state overall, while Trump faces eroding support in sprawling suburban communities, such as those areas around Charlotte and Raleigh. Biden leads by 16 points among suburban voters. This marks a new troubling development for Trump, who won suburban voters in the state by a wide margin of victory.
Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2008 by generating a high turnout of black voters. Biden could do the same with a strong “get out the vote” campaign, given his support with black voters. There are some doors for Biden to win in traditional swing states and might even upset Trump in a few traditional red states. However, the odds for Biden are based on the ability, or lack thereof, of Trump to make a case to voters that he has set the country on track toward an economic recovery this year.

0,05/24/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/499341-why-withdrawal-from-open-skies-harms-national-security-interests,Why withdrawal from Open Skies harms national security interests,"President Trump
has announced that the United States would withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, citing violations by Russia. The Open Skies Treaty allows 35 countries to conduct unarmed surveillance over each other in an effort to provide transparency about military actions and to reduce the possibility of conflicts. It is part of a broad network of arms control agreements that ensure the stability between countries.
The decision to withdraw from this pact goes against our interests, and it harms our relationships with European allies. It will embolden Russia and leave American forces and partners with less protection and coordination in the region, increasing the threat of aggression from Russia. In justifying the decision, the administration argued that Russia was not abiding by the Open Skies Treaty, citing complaints from American officials who claimed that Russia was not allowing any flights over areas with military exercises, including where they believe nuclear weapons might be stationed.
American presidents should steadfastly pursue a foreign policy that puts our interests first and foremost, while holding aggressive countries such as Russia accountable. However, it is clear that this decision to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty goes against our own interests by damaging our relationships with European allies that count on this pact for security, and it leaves deployed American forces at risk while doing nothing more to contain the military actions and nuclear capabilities of Russia.
European members of the Open Skies Treaty, such as France, Germany, and Poland, have expressed concerns over the withdrawal of the United States, arguing that despite doubts over Russia abiding by the terms of the pact, actions taken by Russia so far do not justify the United States leaving the agreement. The domestic political backlash to the decision was swift with Democrats in Congress highly criticizing the withdrawal. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith declared the decision a “slap in the face to our allies in Europe, leaves our deployed forces in the region at risk, and is in blatant violation of the law.”
Moreover, this is the third major arms control agreement which Trump has pulled out of since taking office. This indicates that if he wins the election, he would withdraw from that only remaining arms agreement with Russia, which is the New Start Treaty. Trump has said that he would not renew the New Start Treaty negotiated by President Obama. The pact imposes limits on nuclear arms deployments by the United States and Russia.
Further, the administration has reportedly talked about the United States conducting its first nuclear test in nearly 30 years. This would be a sharp reversal from the suspension on testing. Taken with the withdrawals from several nuclear accords and arms agreements, resuming nuclear testing would have destabilizing effects on our national security, since doing so could encourage other countries to strengthen their programs.
This is true for rogue countries like North Korea, as nuclear talks with Kim Jong Un are stalled, and Iran, after the United States left the nuclear deal without negotiating a replacement. Withdrawal from the New Start Treaty would embolden Russia to augment its program since it would no longer feel bound by the containment accords of the last few decades.

As I have previously written, Russia has tactically amassed many ballistic missiles and invested heavily in weapons system modernization over the years. The most effective deterrent the United States has against a more aggressive Russia is a commitment to our allies. Leaving the Open Skies Treaty and others sows division between the United States and our allies. This is exactly what Vladimir Putin, who wants to restore the influence of Russia back to the days of Soviet Union glory, has been seeking.
I implore the administration to consider keeping the United States in other arms control agreements to ensure that our national security is protected, while reaffirming our commitment to our valuable European allies in order to ensure a peaceful world order rather than a more volatile one.

0,05/22/20 05:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/499217-americans-will-vote-for-their-lives,Americans will vote for their lives,"The right to vote is precisely what makes our government a democracy by the people and for people. So many have sacrificed plenty for the right to vote. While bipartisan efforts expanded the right to vote in our history, the current rancor and sharp divides in our society have led some in power to believe their road to victory includes the systemic disenfranchisement of certain groups of voters. Unfortunately, the coronavirus can be used as a ruse through which they could seek to expand that disenfranchisement.
The pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color, both in the economy and overall infections of the coronavirus. Now is the time for more democracy and more voices from impacted communities. Under normal circumstances, the promise of democracy in the United States is access to participation in elections. We must not let that commitment be undermined by poor election administration that can lead to low turnout.
Government decisions have immediate life and death consequences, so the will of the people must be heard. The Heroes Act allocated more than $3 billion toward election security assistance, setting an appropriate floor that the Senate needs to meet or exceed. Our patchwork election system is outdated at best, but in the midst of a pandemic, it has become unsafe.
No American should have to choose between protecting their safety and exercising their right to vote. The explicit risks that the coronavirus poses to our democracy include low registration, dismal turnout, administration errors, too few polling workers, and increased risk of infection as a result of unprepared election sites. Fortunately, these risks are known and they can be managed with smart planning and immediate legislative actions.
First, Congress must expand access through automatic voter registration. For Americans who are not covered by automatic registration since those traditional registration routes are narrowed, Congress needs to give them more time and opportunities to register with online voter registration and same day registration. Most states already allow their residents to register to vote online, while North Dakota requires no registration at all, but there are still several states that continue to refuse this common sense reform.
Through same day registration, eligible voters are able to join the rolls or correct their records on the day they cast a ballot. It is critical in addition to online registration, as some voters may not have internet access. They include low income voters, who are disproportionately those of color, or Native American communities, which have limited broadband access on tribal lands. While several states allow people to register and vote on the same day, this option is still not possible for voters in a majority of states.
Second, Americans want mail voting. For this to be truly universal and not perpetuate existing divides in society, voters should receive stamped and addressed envelopes far in advance of the election. They also must not be required to break quarantine to photocopy identification or obtain witness signatures. Congress needs to act quickly to ensure the Postal Service has the necessary resources to fulfill its key purposes, along with the freedom to continue serving the public in an efficient manner as it has for decades.
Finally, we must resist the temptation to limit in person voting because of the pandemic. Mail voting elections without an option of in person voting will disenfranchise many voters, particularly black and brown voters who face higher barriers to mail voting. We have also seen women, particularly women of color, express their concerns at higher rates than other groups that their votes will not be counted as intended. Congress has to address this as women today constitute the majority of voters across the country.

Congress also should ensure in person voting is safe with trained polling workers, sufficient numbers of polling places, generous early voting, and protective equipment. Some of our organizations have now been helping recruit additional polling workers, given higher risks of the coronavirus to the elderly. Congress should incentivize greater participation by offering hazard pay and protective equipment. In recent years, some legislatures have disproportionately closed polling places for communities of color.
There must be increased polling opportunities in these areas to minimize the crowding in the places that have been hit hardest by the coronavirus. Early voting is decisive for black and brown voters, who are more likely to work in jobs without flexibility or paid sick leave. Americans are watching how seriously Congress takes the health of our democracy and the safety of its constituents. By taking action, our leaders can make sure we come together in every election between now and November to prove that the government for the people prevails, even amid an unprecedented crisis.

at the same popularity as this time last year but actually rising in states like Ohio. When one poll found him leading by 7 points in battleground states, John King warned his viewers to “be careful not to invest too much in any one poll” especially amid the coronavirus. While Biden leads in other polls, the situation is certainly not unique.
The media seems to be confused. It was not supposed to work this way. With unrelentingly negative coverage of an impeachment, a pandemic, and an economic collapse, voters were supposed to be angry. There is even a psychological model for such social cognitive learning known as “Bobo the Clown” and, while this experiment by the psychologist Albert Bandura was done 60 years ago, recent polls suggest that conditioning does not work quite as well in politics as it does on playgrounds.
In 1961, Bandura used a goofy inflatable clown named Bobo and had children watch adults as they acted aggressively toward it. Soon the children would follow the example of the adults and beat the clown. Conversely, when children watched the clown being treated without aggression by the adults, they were less aggressive toward it.
For many voters, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are not funny clowns, and voters are being conditioned by the media to treat one aggressively and the other unaggressively. It was not the first attempt at it. In 2016, when every poll indicated that voters wanted outsider candidates, Democrats pushed Hillary Clinton, one of the most unpopular candidates in history. She was beaten by Trump, who was the other most unpopular candidate. After positive treatment of Clinton and negative coverage of Trump, the election stunned experts who predicted an easy win for Clinton.
The conclusion of the media appears to be that the scathing treatment in 2016 was not actually aggressive enough. The president today is routinely called a clown by some in the media. There are also consistent attacks on Trump supporters. As Washington Post “conservative columnist” Jennifer Rubin has declared that Trump supporters on the whole are racists, that common stereotyping of Trump supporters is uncontested, even as the media objects to his generalized statements about other groups.
Leonard Pitts wrote a recent column in which he said Trump supporters “fear a black and brown America.” Indeed, the media narrative today has moved past that description by Clinton of Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables” to portraying Trump supporters as racists. Even wearing “Make America Great Again” hats is denounced by some academics as a kind of symbol of “modern day hitlerjugend” and hate speech.
It is all part of media cognitive learning, and it is working in a curious way. Polls show Trump at the exact same spot as he was last year, with about 43 percent support. Trump is even ahead in Ohio by 3 points in a survey done by Emerson College. Trump and Biden are in a statistical dead heat in Wisconsin. As in 2016, the media narrative is forcing Trump supporters in the political closet but not away from backing the president.
Meanwhile, the media has been working hard at less aggressive treatment of Biden. His gaffes are quickly dismissed. When he was accused of sexual assault, the media reluctantly noted the story. Even when Biden espoused the Postal Service conspiracy theory that Trump would somehow halt the election this year, the media called it a prediction and ignored that it was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the Constitution.
The Media Research Center found network evening news was 96 percent negative against Trump last year. The drumbeat rose with impeachment and pandemic coverage this year. Despite this, polls show the number of voters expressing strong enthusiasm for Biden is wallowing at 24 percent, while Trump is at 53 percent. Additionally, Biden is just 3 points ahead of Trump in recent polls, behind where Clinton was in 2016. The reason may be that the narrative against Trump is so overwhelming that voters think they are being played like kids in the psychology experiment.
Consider again the attack of Rubin on most Republicans. She lashed out at the immigration order by Trump during the pandemic. But she was still not satisfied with denouncing this new policy as a stunt to appeal to the unemployed. She declared there is no doubt the Trump base is “primarily motivated by racism.” The statement reveals the accepted and unhinged bias against all Trump supporters by the mainstream media.
I did not vote for Trump and I have criticized him publicly. But I have also watched the stereotyping of Trump supporters at media conferences for years. That suggests those 63 million American who had voted for Trump in 2016 are all racists. It ignores the fact that Clinton was widely viewed as pathologically inauthentic. Polls show 85 percent of Republicans support Trump. According to Rubin, those 85 percent of Republicans are primarily motivated by racism. This tracks with zero sense of reality.
What is not discussed in the media is that people have reasons other than racism in voting for Trump. The fact is that he has a curious record. He is often chastised for untrue statements, yet he has one of the best records for delivering on campaign promises, like cracking down on immigration, building the Mexican border wall, nominating conservative jurists, rolling back regulations, allowing oil drilling, and lowering taxes.

These and many other features of his administration happen to be the most controversial, but they also remain on the wish list of conservatives dating back to Ronald Reagan. Indeed, while 85 percent of Republicans support Trump, a new poll shows more than 20 percent of Republicans would like to see someone else as their nominee. Yet Rubin and others simply dismiss all Trump supporters as monolithic racists.
Recent polls indicate that the unending media attacks on Trump and his supporters are not actually conditioning but instead are repelling voters. They are fulfilling his narrative that voters cannot trust the media. While many voters may still view both Trump and Biden as clowns, they resent getting continually conditioned to punch one over the other. Indeed, if Trump wins reelection, he could have the media to thank.

0,05/14/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/497711-the-unmasking-of-joe-biden,The unmasking of Joe Biden,"The declassification of material from the Michael Flynn case has exposed more chilling details of an effort by prosecutors to come up with a crime to use against the former national security adviser. This week, however, a letter revealed another unsettling detail. Among over three dozen Obama administration officials seeking to “unmask” Flynn in the investigation was former Vice President Joe Biden
. This revelation came less than a day after Biden denied any involvement in the investigation of Flynn. It also follows a disclosure that President Obama was aware of that investigation.
For three years, many in the media have expressed horror at the notion of the Trump campaign colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 election. We know there was never credible evidence of such collusion. In recently released transcripts, a long list of Obama administration officials admitted they never saw any evidence of such Russian collusion. That included the testimony of Evelyn Farkas, a former White House adviser who was widely quoted by the media with her public plea for Congress to gather all of the evidence that she learned of as part of the Obama administration.
The media covered her concern that this evidence would be lost “if they found out how we knew what we knew” about Trump campaign officials “dealing with Russians.” Yet in her classified testimony under oath, she said she did not know anything. Farkas is now running for Congress in New York and highlighting her role in raising “alarm” over collusion. As much of the media blindly pushed this story, a worrying story unfolded over the use of federal power to investigate political opponents.
There is very little question that the response by the media to such a story would have been overwhelming if George Bush and his administration had targeted the Obama campaign figures with secret surveillance. That story would have been encompassing if it was learned that there was no direct evidence to justify the investigation and that the underlying allegation of Russian collusion was ultimately found to lack a credible basis.
But the motives of Obama administration officials are apparently not to be questioned. Indeed, back when candidate Donald Trump
said the Obama administration placed his campaign officials under surveillance, the media universally mocked him. That statement was later proven to be true. The Obama administration used the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court to conduct surveillance of Trump campaign officials.
Yet none of this matters as the media remains fully invested in the original false allegations of collusion. If Obama administration officials were to be questioned now, the coverage and judgment of the media may be placed into question, as even this latest disclosure from the investigation of the unmasking request of Biden will not alter the media narrative.
Unmasking occurs when an official asks an intelligence agency to remove anonymous designations hiding the identity of an individual. This masking is a very important protection of the privacy of American citizens who are caught up in national security surveillance. The importance of this privacy protection is being dismissed by media figures, like Andrea Mitchell, who declared the Biden story to be nothing more than gaslighting.
While unmasking is more routinely requested by intelligence officials, with a reported 10,000 such requests by the National Security Agency last year alone, it is presumably less common for figures like Biden or White House chief of staff Denis McDonough. Seeking unmasking information that was likely to reveal the name of a political opponent and possibly damage the Trump administration raises a concern. More importantly, it adds a detail of the scope of interest and involvement in an investigation that targeted Flynn without any compelling evidence of a crime or collusion.
The media portrayed both Obama and Biden as uninvolved. But now we know they both actively followed the investigation. According to former acting attorney general Sally Yates, she was surprised that Obama knew about the investigation and knew more than she did at the time. Obama called upon former FBI director James Comey to stay after a meeting to discuss the investigation. Comey had mentioned using the Logan Act to charge Flynn, even though the unconstitutional law has never been used successfully in a prosecution since the country was founded.
Biden has repeatedly denied knowledge of the investigation. Just a day before the latest disclosure, George Stephanopoulos asked Biden in an interview what he knew of the Flynn investigation. Biden was adamant that he knew nothing about “those moves” and he called it a diversion. But that is not true if he took the relatively uncommon action for a vice president of demanding the unmasking of Flynn information.
Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks
Trump campaign manager: We want more debates against Biden, and sooner
Yet none of this matters. A Democratic administration using a secret court to investigate the opposing political campaign does not matter to many in Congress or in the media anyway. An investigation continuing despite the lack of credible information supporting collusion does not matter to them either. A president and a vice president who take personal interest in the surveillance of their political opponents also does not matter.
There was a time, however, when all of this did matter. There was once a time when this would be viewed as the story of the century, including the unmasking of Biden himself in this investigation. But these are not those times, and this cannot be the story. Russian collusion is the story and, as Biden stressed, the rest is just a diversion. It is up to the public to decide who has been ultimately unmasked by the Flynn investigation.

, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has pledged to continue funding the dysfunctional World Health Organization. It is not just another tip of the hat to the left wing. It is an open admission that the former vice president is willing to do whatever it takes to protect Chinese interests.
In a recent interview, Biden revealed that he would restore funding to the World Health Organization if he is elected president in November, despite concerns about how the institution mishandled the coronavirus crisis. Let us all remember that during the early stages of the pandemic, the World Health Organization criticized international restrictions, urging countries to avoid using travel bans such as the ones imposed by President Trump
.
Only three months ago, the World Health Organization director general said, “We reiterate our call to all countries not to impose restrictions that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” arguing that such travel bans would trigger “fear and stigma with little public health benefit.” This kind of open borders message from a globalist institution funded with American taxpayer dollars is what liberal Democrats love.
Leading infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, however, has offered a totally different take on the travel bans by the White House. Fauci praised the swift decision of Trump to restrict international travel from China and Europe, explaining that it played a key role in preventing the early spread of the disease in the United States, thereby saving American lives. “It was pretty compelling that we needed to turn off the source,” Fauci claimed.
The World Health Organization also infamously echoed Chinese talking points early this year, endorsing the unfounded claim by Beijing that the coronavirus could not spread between humans. The group had ignored the obvious pitfall of encouraging international complacency toward the coronavirus threat based on “preliminary investigations” by the Chinese regime desperate to appear competent and sympathetic to human life.
Imagine how many more lives could have been saved if the World Health Organization had just issued the appropriate advice to the international community. Think how much devastation could have been prevented if it did not push Chinese propaganda. According to a recent study from the University of Southampton, the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by a stunning 95 percent if Chinese authorities acted just three weeks earlier. Where was the World Health Organization as Beijing was clearly hiding the truth about the pandemic from the entire planet?
Sadly, the eagerness of Biden to write the World Health Organization a check is not the only time he has run interference for China during this crisis. When the White House first announced lifesaving restrictions on international travel, Biden immediately accused Trump of “xenophobia” and “fear mongering.” Some things never change with some politicians.
Trump is correct that the United States should not send another taxpayer dime to the World Health Organization until authorities fully investigate its botched response to the deadly coronavirus pandemic. Now is simply not the time to cover for this globalist institution that serves the government interests of the Chinese regime at the expense of countless human lives.

0,05/04/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/495924-how-to-protect-the-right-to-vote,How to protect the right to vote,"When the books and blue ribbon reports are written on the response by the United States to the global pandemic of 2020, one fact will stand out. Governments at every level were unprepared and playing catch up as the coronavirus made its voracious march across the country. Nowhere was this clearer than Wisconsin, where the state legislature and the Supreme Court refused to delay a scheduled primary election last month after the coronavirus swept in, forcing thousands of citizens to crowd a few open polling places and risk their lives to exercise the right to vote. Wisconsin health officials confirmed that dozens of people who voted in person or worked at polling places have since tested positive for the coronavirus.
A tragedy of far greater proportions awaits if officials do not quickly take proactive steps to avoid such a situation this fall. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director warned that a second wave of infections, even more dire than the current one, is likely to hit later this year with the start of flu season. Absent some common sense preparations, the lives of thousands of Americans could be at risk in the upcoming election. Worse yet, some people may argue that the election should be delayed, a move that would profoundly shake public faith in our democracy here at home.
The Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress has joined with a coalition of nonpartisan electoral reform groups to launch Fix the System, a new group dedicated to effective governance and fair representation for all Americans. One measure stands above all others as the country faces this pandemic, and this measure is expanding the ability to vote by mail.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ohio recently offered a glimpse of what such a proactive proposal might look like. At the urging of Republican Governor Mike DeWine, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle unanimously approved an all mail vote for the primary election that had successfully concluded last week. Governors and state legislatures across the country need to quickly adopt vote by mail reforms in anticipation of the election this fall. Additional federal funds must also be made available immediately to assist these efforts.
Mail voting carries advantages over in person voting, and it is typically cheaper. Not only does the practice reduce long waits at overburdened polling stations, it also increases fairness, bolsters overall turnout, and makes voting procedures much more conducive for public health. Red, blue, and purple states have discovered these advantages after a lot of experience with absentee voting. States only need to expand measures that already exist today and are in widespread use across the country.
Criticism that mail voting is less secure than in person voting does not hold up to scrutiny. The digital machines used in many physical polling stations are vulnerable to hacking or other tampering, for instance, and many leave no paper trail to verify results or conduct recounts. Voting by mail necessarily leaves such a paper trail, and the ballots themselves are marked with barcodes unique to each voter. So as long as voter rolls are kept up to date, which is crucial for accurate voting by mail or in person, then mailed ballots are arguably more secure than conventional voting.
Voter turnout in the United States also lags behind many other advanced democracies, largely because we make it harder for voters to exercise that right. Many Americans simply do not have the ability to vote, whether it is due to work schedules, health concerns, child care, or some other reason. By contrast, in both the 2016 and 2018 elections, the states that employed mail voting witnessed 10 percent greater turnout on average. Mail voting can also help address the criticism that some states discriminate against minority voters by closing polling places in majority minority precincts.

Virtually every state has experience dealing with mail or absentee ballot systems, which are particularly helpful to military voters or citizens with mobility challenges. Five states already conduct their elections almost entirely by mail, and three other states each allow counties to conduct elections completely by mail if they so choose. Another 28 states allow voters to cast absentee ballots by mail without having to give a reason. Meanwhile, more than 70 percent of Americans of all political leanings support the introduction of mail ballots to make elections much safer.
The coronavirus has exposed weaknesses in institutions and governing systems, but it has reminded us that we are in this crisis as one people, battling a common scourge and united by the ties that bind us. Perhaps the most fundamental is the right to vote, which needs to be protected from all the ravages of this disease in the coming months and beyond.

0,05/02/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/495788-the-dangerous-liberal-ideas-for-censorship-in-the-united-states,The dangerous liberal ideas for censorship in the United States,"Almost everywhere you turn today, politicians are telling the public to “get used to the new normal” after the pandemic. For some people, this means public health precautions from social distancing to banning handshakes. Others have quickly added long standing dreams for everything from the guaranteed basic income advocated by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, which was also recently raised by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to mailed voting elections advocated by many Democrats.
The most chilling suggestion, however, comes from the politicians and academics who have called for the censorship of social media and the internet. The only thing spreading faster than the coronavirus has been censorship and the loud calls for more restrictions on free speech. The Atlantic recently published an article by Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith and University of Arizona law professor Andrew Keane Woods calling for Chinese style censorship of the internet.
They declared that “in the great debate of the past two decades about freedom versus control of the network, China was largely right and the United States was largely wrong” as “significant monitoring and speech control are inevitable components of a mature and flourishing internet, and governments must play a large role in such practices to ensure that the internet is compatible with society norms and values.”
The justification for that is the danger of “fake news” about coronavirus risks and cures. Yet this is only the latest rationalization for rolling back free speech rights. For years, Democratic leaders in Congress called for censorship of “fake news” on social media sites. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have all engaged in increasing levels of censorship and have a well known reputation for targeting conservative speech.
Hillary Clinton has demanded that political speech be regulated to avoid the “manipulation of information” and stated that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg “should pay a price for what he is doing to our democracy” by refusing to remove any opposition postings. In Europe, free speech rights are in a free fall, and countries such as France and Germany are imposing legal penalties designed to censor speech across the world.
Many of us in the free speech community have warned about the growing insatiable appetite for censorship in the West. Yet we have been losing the fight, and free speech opponents are now capitalizing on the opportunity presented by the pandemic. Representative Adam Schiff sent a message to the executives of Google, Twitter, and YouTube demanding censorship of anything deemed “misinformation” and “false information.”
Yet YouTube did exactly that a few days earlier by removing two videos of California doctors who called for the easing of state lockdown orders. The doctors argued that the coronavirus is not as dangerous as suggested and that some deaths associated with the pandemic are not accurate. There is ample reason to contest their views but, instead, YouTube banned the two videos to keep others from reaching their own conclusions.
Facebook will not only remove posts it considers misinformation about the coronavirus but will issue warnings to those who “like” such postings. Facebook said that it wants to protect people from dangerous remedies and false data. Ironically, the World Health Organization praised Sweden for its rejection of the very restrictions criticized by the two doctors. The group declared that Sweden is a “model” country despite its rejection of lockdown measures being protested in the United States.
Moreover, many mainstream media sources have reported information that is now known to be false from the lack of any benefits of wearing masks to the failure in trials of drugs like remdesivir to the shortage of thousands of ventilators. Despite those being wrong, related opposing views were often treated as either fringe or false positions.
This subjectivity of censorship is why the cure is worse than the illness. The best cure for bad speech is more speech rather than regulation. The fact is that the pandemic, as Clinton reminded voters, is a “terrible crisis to waste.” Yet the waste for some would be to emerge from the pandemic with free speech still alive. Even former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean, who has falsely declared that hate speech is not protected under the First Amendment, recently boycotted MSNBC until it stopped airing press briefings by President Trump as “fake news.”
Ocasio Cortez has called for action against Facebook for not censoring false or misleading political ads. In a confrontation with Zuckerberg, she dismissed concerns over censorship of speech and demanded, “So you will not take down lies or you will take down lies? I think that is a pretty simple yes or no.” Whether contesting lockdown orders by officials or challenging the views of politicians, you can just declare an opposing view as “misinformation” and demand that others not see it.
This crisis is a chance to redefine free speech to allow greater ability to control what opponents say and what the public reads. Academics have been laying the foundation for an anemic form of free speech for years. Even college presidents a few years ago had declared that there is no protection for “disingenuous misrepresentation of free speech.”
Goldsmith and Woods wrote that the public should resist those “urging a swift return to normal,” and the “extraordinary measures we are seeing are not all that extraordinary.” So this is the new normal that some leaders and academics want the public to accept. After all, it is tough to get people to give up freedoms. It takes a crisis to convince them that notions like free speech are no longer relevant. After spending years seeking to convince Americans to follow the European trend against free speech, these folks are using the pandemic to claim that free speech could kill you.
Censorship works in a country much like the coronavirus. Initially, you feel better from silencing those views that you consider lies. Then comes the crash as others demand more and more censorship, including views that you consider to be true. That is what has happened in Europe, where an expanding range of speech is being criminalized or censored. Without uncensored speech, the political system is left gasping for air.

China has been particularly eager not to “waste” the opportunity of this crisis. Chinese professor Xu Zhangrun is one of many citizens arrested after publishing criticism of Xi Jinping on his handling of the crisis. The government deemed such criticism to be fake news causing panic. It has censored accounts of its concealing the source of the original outbreak, including censorship on popular Chinese apps such as WeChat.
Citizens now will have to decide, as Goldsmith and Woods insist, if “China was right.” For my part, I remain hopeless in my longing for old fashioned free speech before the pandemic. You see, this “new normal” seems a lot like the old normal which the Framers changed with the First Amendment. China may be right for many in Congress and academia, but it remains on the wrong side of history. Not even a pandemic will change that.

. He has already committed to naming a woman to be his vice president, and he has a rich field to choose from, as the bench of party members runs deep. As the presumptive Democratic nominee, he should carefully consider all of his choices. It will certainly be the most important decision that he will make before the election.
The first rule is to do no harm. Given the talented roster of black women in office, Biden can be confident that no potential choices would bring harm to him or to the nation. The second rule is also critical. He must choose a winner, or at least someone who bolsters the ticket. The key to victory for Democrats is indeed turnout. The higher the turnout, the more likely they win. Black voters comprise the most loyal base of the party. Black voters have also been poorly served by President Trump. This is why he asks, “What do they have to lose?” The answer is everything.
Now is not the time for Biden to get cute. Every cycle, politicians show up at black churches and tell the African American community what they will do to make their lives better. They usually give the same formulaic speech centered around civil rights, criminal justice, and the systemic unfairness that takes place in this country. This all sounds nice, but as soon as these politicians get elected, the interests of the African American community become a lower priority. That will simply not fly this time.
If Biden is going to beat Trump, he needs support from black voters. He can increase their turnout by naming a black woman as his pick for vice president. There are numerous qualified candidates to accomplish that goal, but none of them would drive African American voter turnout the way Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, or Val Demmings would.
For every Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, there are also many more black women in office who have put in the work and still have not gotten the job. Being on the short list is not enough. It is time for someone like Harris to get the job. This is not a criticism of Klobuchar or Warren, who are absolutely qualified to be vice president. It is just an uncomfortable truth. Black women, who are the most loyal members of the Democratic base, will drive turnout and get the job done to elect Biden.
Without support from black voters, specifically black women, Biden would not be the presumptive Democratic nominee. Before his key endorsement from James Clyburn, his campaign was gasping for oxygen, leaving many to wonder whether the former vice president would even make it to South Carolina. Biden not only made it to South Carolina, but he handily won the state and catapulted his campaign into the history books.
The numbers do not lie. More than 60 percent of the votes cast by African Americans in South Carolina went to Biden. He also won over 60 percent of black Democratic voters in Virginia, Michigan, and Alabama, and about 60 percent of black Democratic voters in Texas and North Carolina. This is the reason why it is so important for Biden to choose a black woman to be his running mate so he secures this turnout in the election.

Tensions flare as GOP's Biden probe ramps up 
It is not as if there are not enough qualified black women candidates. The party certainly has several of them and each one brings unique strengths to the table. Biden should think carefully about the message that he sends to the African American community if he does not choose a black woman for vice president. Trump would surely call him out for it.
Biden needs to make the smart choice, the prudent choice, and the right choice to select a black woman to be his running mate. The failure to do so engenders unnecessary risks and may prove to be a costly mistake the party cannot afford to make with Trump on the ballot. In a campaign cycle with many difficult decisions, this is certainly an easy one.

now sit in a much more perilous position than ever. With more than 26 million Americans unemployed and an entire decade of job gains wiped due to the coronavirus pandemic, he continuously fails to provide the effective leadership and direction which the public is so desperately seeking during this historic national crisis.
Trump has created plenty of confusion and chaos over who has power to reopen states, initially claiming his “total authority” then walking back and conceding that it was in fact the responsibility of the governors. Moreover, Trump has also spread false information about the effectiveness of certain drugs at treating the coronavirus, even insinuating that humans injecting disinfectants could perhaps be an effective way to combat the disease.
While Trump commands attention as the face of the federal response to the coronavirus, attempting to cast himself as a “wartime president” and leaving Joe Biden
to seek some spotlight from his home in Delaware, his erratic behavior and uneven handling of the pandemic is taking a toll on his polling numbers in key swing states that are critical for his election.
In Michigan, a state Trump won in 2016 and where the coronavirus wields a tragic and deadly toll, Trump trails Biden by 8 points, according to two statewide polls. According to a Fox News poll last week, Biden also leads Trump 49 percent to 41 percent. An Ipsos poll this month also shows that Biden holds a similar advantage of 46 percent to 38 percent. In Wisconsin, another critical battleground state Trump narrowly won in 2016, the Ipsos poll shows Biden slightly leads the president 43 percent to 40 percent.
In Pennsylvania, a state Trump also won in 2016 and will be important this fall, the Ipsos poll shows Biden leads 46 percent to 40 percent. According to the Fox News poll, Biden also leads Trump 50 percent to 42 percent. In Florida, a critical battleground state with some notable Republican gains in recent years, Biden leads 46 percent to 42 percent, a new Quinnipiac University poll found last week. Further, a Fox News poll conducted last week shows Biden also leads the president 46 percent to 43 percent.
While swing state polling is indicative of the prospects of Trump, national polling reveals that his federal response has taken a toll on his chances in the election in November. A Wall Street Journal poll shows Biden leads the president 49 percent to 42 percent. A Harvard Harris poll shows him with a similar advantage and leads Trump 53 percent to 47 percent nationally.
The Wall Street Journal poll reveals that voters thought Biden would do a better job than Trump in managing the crisis by a margin of 9 points. The initial polling bump that Trump had in managing the crisis has dissolved. Trump, getting a record 48 percent approval rating last month, has seen his numbers drop while he trails Biden nationwide and in swing states.
The weakened position and erratic messaging of Trump could also hurt Republicans in down ballot races. In Arizona, Democrat Mark Kelly leads incumbent Republican Senator Martha McSally by 9 points at 51 percent to 42 percent, according to a Predictive Insights poll. To be sure, Trump also trails Biden 52 percent to 43 percent in the swing state of Arizona.
While we are still six months away from the election, these numbers are a worrying sign for both Trump and Republicans. If he continuously fails to exhibit better leadership and proves unable to communicate a reassuring message, the president needs to prepare for a sizable loss in November.

0,04/25/20 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/494632-joe-biden-fuels-election-conspiracy-theory-while-the-media-keeps-quiet,Joe Biden fuels election conspiracy theory while the media keeps quiet,"If there are two words that have been the mantra in the media during the last three years with President Trump
, they would be “conspiracy theory.” That label is a wonderful device to attack political opponents. It not only suggests something is objectively untrue but that the person responsible for it is unhinged and unreliable. When Republican members of Congress had suggested that the coronavirus might have come from a research lab in Wuhan, for instance, it was widely denounced as a conspiracy theory, even though some intelligence officials believe the theory is credible.
It is a term that is almost exclusively reserved in the media for Trump and his supporters. That was evident this week when the ultimate conspiracy theory was declared by the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden
, who warned that he was certain Trump plans to delay the election this fall. It is a conspiracy theory utterly without factual or constitutional support, yet his warning was deemed a “prediction” by Politico in a recent article. It has been peddled by various Democratic officials and commentators for months and is all the rage on the internet, even though it should be sold as a set including a tin foil hat and an electromagnetic ghost detector.
Biden left little doubt of such a plan by Trump. He said, “Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, and come up with some rationale why it cannot be held.” It is just the type of thing that a crazed guy in a tightly buttoned raincoat whispers to you on the subway. But Biden was not finished. If you attended a recent online fundraiser, you saw Biden grow uncomfortably close and go on to explain that it was the Postal Service which actually revealed the conspiracy theory to him.
Biden alleged that the administration is pressuring the Postal Service to make changes in its operations as a condition for coronavirus relief. So as he explained, “Imagine threatening not to fund the post office. Other than trying to let the word out that he is going to do all he can to make it very hard for people to vote, that is the only way he thinks he can possibly win.” However, the other way would be that his opponent flees to the desert to live inside a bunker and protect his mail and “precious bodily fluids.”
Let us address the mail connection. For years, Trump has been a critic of the Postal Service as being an institution that repeatedly required bailouts due to running huge deficits. He wants the Postal Service to agree to raise fees for mass shippers before it asks for another subsidy. That would have no impact on voting, including mail voting, in the election. Any change in its operations would not impact such things as regular mail this year.
Now for a constitutional reality check of this conspiracy theory of Biden. Elections are indeed managed by states and not the federal government under Article Two. The date of the presidential election is set by federal law and not subject to an executive order. Even war or martial law does not suspend the date of the presidential election. Since 1845, Congress has mandated that the presidential election be on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November every four years. In order to change that date, Trump would have to have both chambers of Congress vote to do so.
Finally, any delay in the election would collide with the 20th Amendment, which extinguishes the power of the president at noon on January 20. So even if Trump somehow persuaded Congress to delay the election after then, his term constitutionally ends on that date unless he is reelected. If Trump tried to stay in office past noon on January 20 if he loses, he would have to join Biden on the subway and whisper to people that he is still the president. Of course, this conspiracy theory is tame compared to other several conspiracy theories voiced by some critics of the president.
Yale University professor Bandy Lee said that Trump plans for more than an effective coup and instead plans for a massacre. I have criticized her for calling for such nonexistent actions as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “putting a medical hold” on Trump. Such nonsensical views are pushed without the type of scrutiny they normally warrant. Today Lee believes Trump is using subconscious techniques to send “armed troops in the streets,” a technique that she explains is used with “child soldiers.”
Lee details how Trump is now testing people for “loyalty to the laws of his mind over the laws of nature, or even impulse for survival” and “the more he abuses them, the greater their devotion grows.” Why exactly is Trump preparing this army of millions of amoral zombies? Like Lee warned, “We would be mistaken to believe he will leave, or even let any losing election happen in the first place.” He is not just preparing them for his notorious brag about a shooting on Fifth Avenue but for a “whole massacre.”
Her bizarre views were featured in a recent interview with Salon without a hint of skepticism. A professor who matter of factly described a president refusing to give up office and preparing for a massacre was perfectly fine to publish. The media also reported that Lee has also briefed Democratic lawmakers on the need to remove Trump as being mentally ill and wildly insisted that if Trump were not president, his “out of touch responses to reality warranted hospitalization or transfer to a nursing home.”
Yet somehow Lee and others apparently do not believe hospitalization is needed for the candidate who thinks there is a conspiracy to control the Postal Service in order to block the next election. In their minds, that is not an “out of touch response to reality.” It is simply a “prediction.” But none of this will help if you encounter Biden and he is still pushing the Postal Service conspiracy theory. In that event, it is better to avoid eye contact, nod in agreement, and say that you use Federal Express.

In extraordinary times, however, incrementalism can be ineffective. The economy prior to the pandemic will not return. If we try to recreate it through gradual steps, we will fail financially and politically. Instead, we need to brace ourselves for the only realistic end point, which is full employment underwritten by the government. We must think imaginatively about what that might take and move there as quickly as possible before the economy turns worse.
The strategy of incrementalism has already lost once to the coronavirus. As the pandemic approached our country, many agencies at all levels of government responded using incremental measures, like banning large gatherings, some travelers, and some services. But none of this worked. There could be no stopping part way. Places that moved quickly to the end point had the best results. Simply compare California to New York.
Something similar is happening now as we approach the other end of the crisis. Applying the mindset of the normal rather than the emergency, we are drawn to incrementalism. If the economy after the pandemic will not replicate the economy before the pandemic, however, these will only be small steps to nowhere. Entire sectors and the millions of jobs that they support have likely vanished, if not forever, at least for a very long time.
There will effectively be no travel, no airlines, no cruises, no hotels, and no vacations. There will be no restaurants, only delivery services. All activities that brought many people together inside of closed spaces will not return, so there will be no sporting events, no concerts, and no theaters. Colleges and universities will have to remake themselves. These sectors supported immense numbers of support services, from janitors to drivers, bankers to lawyers, caterers to event planners, and travel agents to insurance agents.
No stimulus, however significant, can cause obsolete jobs to reappear. No support for the businesses in these sectors can succeed. Even those who have jobs will fear layoffs. So nothing like the old consumer economy can return until there is a vaccine or a safe treatment, any that may take years. The economy could deteriorate too much that any incremental approach will make the decade following the 2008 crisis look like a rapid recovery.
But we do not have that kind of time when it comes to politics. Voters who fail to see a real promise of improvement for themselves and their children will not be patient. They will embrace fantastical ideas, something akin to the rise of fascism in response to the Great Depression. The disruptions to the economy of the last decade, which were minor compared to where we are now, already aided authoritarian electoral victories in places like Brazil and Poland. Sustained frustration and social media is a recipe for disaster.
The efforts to end the Great Depression forced the government to adopt a full employment policy. The aftermath of World War Two meant Americans needed guaranteed work with federal support. The same kind of response is needed today. The government will be pushed to this as incrementalism fails. That which we do reluctantly, however, we are likely to do poorly. The government has to instead act boldly and confidently to come out of this.
The issue we should solve is what full employment through public finance looks like in peacetime. We might begin by turning a substantial portion of the workforce toward our most pressing problem after the pandemic. That is climate change. Absent success in that regard, whatever we do will turn to ruin in a few decades. Rebuilding infrastructure is certainly high on that agenda, but so is energy production from renewable resources. Ensuring our housing and transportation sectors green should also move forward.

A successful program to address climate change must be international. We will have to send an army of green workers overseas to assist others address our shared climate problem. Federal support should also flow to state and local governments. We should invest heavily in our schools and education to make up for the lost pandemic years. We have also learned we need to do a much better job of caring for our elderly and vulnerable populations. There is no other time to take up these tasks than right now.
The right mix of public and private, but subsidized, employment must be settled. We need to help those private businesses that can survive. Once we commit to full employment, there will be a good deal less pressure to support businesses and sectors that cannot survive. The workers in those businesses should know that they will have a secure future. Our recovery requires thinking bigger than ever before. Now the best is not the enemy of the good. It is the only hope for the good. The economy is not only to rebuild but to reimagine. The faster we move, the better it will be for all.

may have issued his deeply reluctant endorsement of Joe Biden last week, but this does not mean his supporters will follow suit. His own spokeswoman balked at the attempt to sell fusionism, and I suspect her reservations reflect those of many Sanders voters who view Biden as the embodiment of the political establishment that their movement tried to dismantle. No one can expect Sanders voters to flock to Donald Trump
, but there are reasons that it makes more sense than falling in line behind Biden. Democratic socialism, the ideology Sanders has espoused for his long career, is a dead end based on false premises and empty promises.
While “free everything” fantasies and expanded government control are the antithesis of what Trump stands for, Sanders voters have many of the same enemies as the “Make America Great Again” movement, namely an unaccountable elite promoting globalism and cratering the middle class. This is important today as we confront a deadly pandemic that highlights the failings of globalism, including corrupt international institutions such as the World Health Organization, too much reliance on foreign suppliers for essential products, and the dangers of allowing unregulated borders.
In his campaign, Sanders disavowed former commitments to immigration enforcement and downplayed his opposition to the free trade agenda. He instead focused on trying to be as “woke” as possible for progressives on race, gender, and sexual identity politics. Sanders walked back previous support for the Second Amendment. But none of it worked. Black voters favored Biden, and supporters of Elizabeth Warren tried to smear him as sexist. Yet it took a concerted effort by the Democratic establishment, as seen in the withdrawals of every remaining alternative to Biden, to cheat Sanders out of the Democratic nomination for the second time in a row.

If he stuck completely to his own principles, then Sanders would have been accused of acting too much like Trump. Funny how politics works. As Sanders supporters consider whether they can bring themselves to support a party that hurt their candidate so much, some of them might realize that Trump is the one candidate in this race who will deliver on their central aim of a prosperous and equal country run for the people.

Others will surely be tempted to hold their noses and vote for Biden, but I would point to the very similar experience of Trump with Republicans as a cautionary tale for anyone tempted to trust the political establishment of either party. Back in 2012, Trump made peace with Republicans in spite of his many disagreements with their approach. He decided that it was more important to beat Barack Obama than to be a purist, so he endorsed Mitt Romney, who lost anyway by running on a traditional Republican platform. But Romney still went on to attack his successor even after it had become clear that Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016 by rejecting many core elements of the brand of centrist establishment conservatism.
Sanders supporters need to know that compromising with establishment politicians offers no benefits, as Democrats have demonstrated twice now by rigging the primary contest against the one candidate who threatened to disrupt their status quo. Sanders surely had his own reasons to decide that he had no choice but to end his campaign and endorse Biden. Those who supported Sanders, however, do not face the same constraints. They have another choice left in this race, of course, and that choice is Trump.

claimed today? This is usually followed by tweeting in all caps, a gnashing of teeth, or the incredulous shaking of heads. Second, why is Biden not out there more? This is usually followed by white knuckled hand squeezing by supporters.
It is true Biden has been less visible than he would normally be, but this is a perfect storm. The media covers the president, governors, mayors, and others whose decisions have direct impacts on our health and safety. We are in an unprecedented climate today where typical candidate visibility in rallies, speeches, fundraisers, and public events is out of the question.
Strong campaigns are built to be agile, as they adjust to fierce headwinds and crosswinds. For full disclosure, I am a Biden supporter. So I asked the campaign of the former vice president how it has adapted to the reality of being a challenger during this national crisis in a virtual environment. The answer here is that Biden has gone to ground, but the ground is strategic.
He is focusing on battleground states with virtual town halls in Florida and Arizona, along with television interviews in media markets in Pennsylvania. Biden has paid attention across different demographics. He held a virtual briefing on young Americans and has made frequent appearances on the late shows that attract those key voters, such as “Quarantine Monologue” with JImmy Kimmel, “The Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon, “Desus and Mero” on Showtime, as well as “The Late Late Show” with James Corden.
He is reaching Latinx voters with appearances on Hispanic radio stations. He appealed to progressive voters in a virtual event with Bernie Sanders
. He has engaged in the health and economic issues on the coronavirus, including a Frontlines roundtable with emergency responders, a virtual briefing on Cares Act implementation and oversight, and a virtual town hall on unemployment and working families with several labor groups.
In addition to these efforts, Biden has done the usual round of interviews across the cable television networks, including a town hall with Anderson Cooper and an interview with Chris Cuomo, along with key appearances on CNN with Brooke Baldwin, MSNBC with Brian Williams, NBC News with Chuck Todd, ABC News with George Stephanopoulos, and many others.

Meanwhile, Trump is putting the bully in the bully pulpit. With a stage to himself, he drove down approval of his handling of the crisis, from a high of 52 percent two weeks ago to a low of 44 percent this week, according to Navigator Research, which aggregates public polling. As the president incites dangerous elements of his own supporters to “liberate” states that maintain social distancing, 60 percent of Americans are more concerned that social distancing will end too soon rather than continue for too long.
This means that sometimes the best campaign strategy is to simply allow your opponent do the talking while you hold onto your edge. Candidates can be invincible or invisible. In fairness, during this era, Biden is neither.

There is no acceptable reason for this to happen, since there are alternatives to voting in person on a single day. But it is possible, although unlikely, that voting by mail will be unrealistic if the pandemic were to get so much worse that it endangered the lives of postal workers. So it is not too early to ask this question. What does the Constitution provide in the event that an emergency precludes an election before the end of a term of the president? It has never happened, and it will likely not happen this year, but law professors like hypotheticals, so here is my assessment.
We begin, of course, with the words of the Constitution. They provide no definitive answer, but they do provide some clear conclusions. Absent an election, the incumbent president does not continue to serve in an interim capacity until an election is finally held. Unlike parliamentary democracies such as Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to serve until his replacement has been selected, the term of our president ends on a specific date, regardless of whether a successor is chosen.
Indeed, the 20th Amendment says “the terms of the president and vice president shall end at noon” on January 20. Nothing could seem clearer. Yet the end of that paragraph provides that “the terms of their successors shall then begin.” But what if no successors have been elected? Does the president continue to serve as an interim officeholder? The answer is no because his or her term will definitely end at noon on January 20. If not reelected, the president becomes a private citizen on that day. So who then serves as president? The Constitution provides no solid answer.

Unlike when a president is impeached or dies, there is no set succession plan for a situation with no election. The 20th Amendment speaks to the issue of when neither a president nor a vice president have been chosen “before the time fixed for the beginning of his term,” but it still refers to a somewhat different scenario. “Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a president elect nor a vice president elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as president, or the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person shall act accordingly until a president or vice president shall have qualified.”
But if there is no election, there is no president elect nor vice president elect. Congress does provide for a line of succession to the White House “if by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, inability, or failure to qualify,” there is neither a president nor a vice president. This also does not appear to encompass the absence of an election. There is an obvious gap in our Constitution as the Framers simply did not contemplate a “no election” scenario. However, even if Congress has the authority to fill this gap in the Constitution, it is unclear that it has done so with the existing law, because the line of succession begins with the House speaker.
But there would be no House speaker if there were no election, because there would be no House, all of whose members would be up for election in November. The terms of all members of the House would end, as stated in the Constitution, on January 3. There would, however, be a Senate, with a majority of its members not up for election in November and, therefore, still serving their terms. This is important as the next in line would be the president pro tempore of the Senate, which is Charles Grassley. However, if there were no election, there may be a Democratic majority among the remaining senators not up for reelection, unless sitting governors or state legislators were allowed to fill vacant seats, which is another issue.

The longest serving majority senator is traditionally handed the honor of serving as the president pro tempore of the chamber. Among Democrats that would be Patrick Leahy. But a Democratic majority could choose any sitting senator for that role, including Elizabeth Warren and even Bernie Sanders. If the succession law covers a missed election, which would be doubtful, then the senator selected to serve as president pro tem would become the next president. This thought is scary enough to Republicans to assure that they will do everything they can to hold the election.
The alternatives are unthinkable in a democracy. We would have a nation with no president and no working Congress, or an interim president who is not definitively authorized by the law. Because of the uncertainty of any alternative to voting, it is in the interest of both parties and all Americans to make sure that the election is held in a safe and timely manner.

Even if the coronavirus crisis abates in the coming months, many Americans will still cast their decisions by absentee ballot or early voting. The vast majority of states and local governments simply do not hold the resources to be ready for this rush. That is why Congress needs to step up right away to assist states and local governments with federal funds to run these critical elections that ensures democracy.
Officials across the political spectrum have been speaking out about the challenges they face to holding safe and secure elections as the country grapples with this pandemic. While running elections is the responsibility of states, as mandated by the Constitution, they need the resources and support that only the federal government can provide in this time of need. The good news is that the stimulus bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump included $400 million to assist states with elections.
This funding was an important down payment, but it is only a fraction of what is needed to ensure safe and secure elections. A majority of voters say they are afraid to vote in person due to the coronavirus. States must prepare now to meet this demand for alternatives to voting in person so Americans have confidence that they can safely be heard, or risk much lower turnout numbers as well as widespread mistrust of the results.
There are a variety of options that each state must explore. Every state in the union has some form of absentee voting, and many states require no excuse to do so. While it is important to remember that absentee ballots and early voting are valuable tools, they are still not a total substitute for voting in person, at least not at the moment. The bottom line is that this November, polls have to also be safe and accessible on Election Day.
The Wisconsin primary showed the chaos that could take hold across the country if Congress fails to act promptly. In Milwaukee, the biggest city in the state, only five of 180 polling locations were open, as the demand for absentee ballots greatly spiked. As the New York Times noted, Wisconsin voters had a choice between their health and their civic duty. The basic principle is that Americans should never have to make that choice.
As the National Association of Secretaries of State made clear in its letter to Congress, the inevitable demand for alternative ways of voting means states must address the current “global supply chain issues for high speed scanners and mail processing equipment” and scarce “necessary cleaning products and personal protective equipment.” States will need assistance with paying for printing, postage, envelopes, and data entry. Some states have already begun to explore other options such as drive up voting, like New Hampshire Governor John Sununu has announced for his state.

Another challenge that states and local governments face is finding and training people to staff polling locations, positions often filled by retirees who are now among those most vulnerable to the coronavirus. We have no idea whether the coronavirus will fade during the summer, and many experts believe there is a chance that it will return in the fall. Needless to say, the time for us to prepare for safe and secure elections is now.
At any time of national crisis, it is critical that the federal government do all it can to help states ensure that our elections proceed smoothly and that all eligible citizens have a real opportunity to cast their ballots. The risk extends beyond elections that are chaotic, unsafe, and mismanaged. Elections that permanently destroy the trust that Americans have in the legitimacy of their institutions, not to mention the legitimacy of results, are just as dangerous. Confidence in our political system is its bedrock. Our experiment in representative government crumbles without it.

to reenter the race for the election. Senator Bernie Sanders officially ended his campaign last week, days after former Vice President Joe Biden was accused of sexual assault by Tara Reade, a Capitol Hill staffer who worked for the former senator in the 1990s.
Stop for a minute and think about this. This means both the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden, as well as the presumptive Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, have been accused of sexual assault. These are incredibly serious allegations. It is possible that some allegations are not true, but that is not very likely given the number of accusers and the fact that false reporting of sexual assault is rare.
How can it be that in the United States, a country of more than 330 million people, and in a field that started with more than 30 candidates, these are the two choices we are left with? It is preposterous and unacceptable. We all know that good and honorable people do exist, and some of them are even politicians. Some of them have even run for president. So how is it that we are left with two accused gropers as our choices this fall?
Do not minimize sexual assault or say that it does not really matter, that it does not impact the ability of a person to govern, and that it is not all that important in the grand scope of things. If you minimize this, you minimize women. The answer is to recognize women by insisting that the one who was always the most qualified of all the candidates running for president, and who also happens to be a woman, needs to reenter the race. Warren suspended her campaign weeks ago, but semantics are important on this. She suspended her campaign. She did not end it. So I am now calling on her to resume it. It is imperative that we have another choice.
I am not a Democrat, and I am not particularly progressive in my political views. I consider myself to be a centrist. I was a lifelong Republican who held classical conservative leanings until I left the party I could no longer recognize after it was hijacked by the Tea Party. I am now unaffiliated with any political party. But I would vote for Warren in a heartbeat.
Warren would be an effective and a moral leader. She would be a unifier, and that is what we desperately need in this country right now. She has experience, she has a plan, and she has a compassionate heart. She also has integrity. She understands and respects the Constitution and the rule of law. Even if I might not agree with some of her more extreme positions, I can at least rest assured that she will respect our system of checks and balances and will not try to overextend her executive reach.

A century after women won the right to vote, it is time for a woman to be our president. There are more women than men in the United States. It is time for us in the majority to have our say. Research clearly indicates that when women are at the governing table, a democracy becomes stronger, more prosperous, and more peaceful. Women more so than men tend to work across party lines, be highly responsive to concerns of constituents, prioritize family, children, health, education, and other key development measures, and secure peaceful agreements to end conflicts.
Warren is a woman eminently qualified to lead in every way. We cannot let her go. In more than 5,000 years of history, save for a few rare incidences, women have had a voice in politics with the right to vote for only the past 100 years. We need Warren today. She should resume her candidacy and challenge Biden, or she can run as an independent. We need a legitimate choice. If we are good enough and wise enough and brave enough, then we will elect her as the next president of the United States.

With the potential for a second wave of infections returning this fall, policymakers on both the federal and state levels should act now to expand ballot access to prepare to conduct the election safely. Unlike primary elections, which can sometimes get postponed, federal law and the Constitution mandate the date of the general election. We are going to vote for president in November, and we need to do it safely.
With its primary falling during the eye of the storm this week, Wisconsin has shown how restrictive voting laws can wreak havoc on elections. The state law requires that a witness validates the identification of each voter, threatening to invalidate the ballots of many people who voted absentee, particularly senior citizens. Because many people have also been isolating themselves to avoid contracting the coronavirus, it can be a challenge to find a witness, particularly for all those voters who live alone.
Other states present glimmers of hope. In Arizona and Florida, with aging populations, primaries went on as scheduled last month. The turnout was not dampened as many had feared. Out in Maricopa County, home to over four million people, 2020 turnout in early and mail voting alone exceeded the total turnout for the entire 2016 Democratic primary. Allowing people to vote early in person or by mail is necessary not only because it grants people the option of casting their ballots from the safety of their homes, but also because it reduces crowding and the strain on polling locations, which are essential for all of these vulnerable communities.
The goal of a democracy should be that every eligible voter has a chance to participate. This should be a bipartisan goal. But President Trump and some Republicans have pushed back against measures to expand ballot access. Trump objected to spending federal funds to extend ballot access as part of the coronavirus relief package, calling it “crazy” in an interview last week. “They had levels of voting that if you would ever agree to it, you would never have a Republican elected in this country again.” To attempt to turn this discussion about enabling all Americans to vote into a purely partisan debate is deeply disappointing in this time of crisis.
There is no evidence that helping eligible voters cast ballots safely will aid Democrats. Polls show the elderly, and most vulnerable in this pandemic, lean right. Red states like Utah mail ballots to registered voters and allow them to vote in person if they choose, and it has not had the effect Trump predicts. It has instead improved participation. Some Republicans protest that states should be left alone to run elections, but that is not an excuse for failing to provide funding for such reforms. States can design the mail voting systems that best suit their circumstances as long as they meet the standard of providing remote ballot access in a time of crisis.

The problem of flawed “signature match” policies could cause trouble in dozens of states where they are on the books. In many states, voters may be removed from the rolls due to mistakes such as misread handwriting or the omission of a hyphen in a name, often without any notice from voters and no opportunity to fix. This practice would have prevented thousands of eligible voters from getting counted in the last midterm election if not for legal challenges by democracy groups. Without safeguards providing voters an opportunity to address potential issues, such matching policies could then disenfranchise tens of thousands of eligible voters.
Our election infrastructure will be tested in November, and policymakers on both the federal and state levels should swiftly implement a series of fixes to assure Americans that voting will be conducted safely and easily. The important thing is for Congress to act now so the people do not have to choose between public health and a healthy democracy this fall. Every single day of preparation for the election this year is precious.

We call them technologies. They are such a part of our identity that we associate human “progress” with the “advanced” technology of the time. We are, some have said, like fish who swim in an ocean increasingly of their own making, an ocean of technology. Both the global spread of COVID-19 and our efforts to combat it illustrate this point.
We understood long ago that society is changed by the technologies we use and not always in ways we like or think are good for us. Today, many wonder whether technology is enriching or impoverishing our lives.
Computers and related technologies applied to communications, the use of information and entertainment are the focus of this concern today — and appropriately so. Americans try to be honest, fair, generous and hopeful. Those behaviors and their underlying value are weakened by our misuses of digital technologies.
Vivid images of endless variety and content available on our phones and computers abstract our perception of reality in powerfully convincing ways. Our use of social media facilitates gatherings and exchanges often void of the accountability, civility and mutual respect that are present in real human communities. Access to 24/7 cable or satellite news leaves us thirsty for knowledge while we drown in information. Communication by tweet oversimplifies complex issues. Our choice of news feeds and “infotainment” personalities provides us with the version of facts and truth we prefer. 
To behave honestly, we must respect facts and the truth that can be found with them. Truth is essential for trust, and communities can’t exist without trust. By belonging to a community we learn fairness, generosity and hopefulness.
Politics is about how we make the rules necessary for us to live together and act collectively.  Our misuse of technologies, starting with television, has played a big role in turning politics into a winner-takes-all game instead of the serious and important work of understanding issues, building consensus and forging compromise around solutions.
Information technologies have profoundly influenced our economics. We have used them to make our financial sector too large, influential and short-term oriented. Modern monopolies are also products of applying digital tools to business. These commercial giants exert significant influence over our consumption patterns and behaviors reinforcing materialism and over-consumption. They manage employee pay, benefits, environmental and other costs to be efficient and competitive on a grand scale. Often, they privatize profits and socialize costs, particularly long-term costs without social conscience. Our technology-influenced economic system has led to an explosion of choice that contributes to our hyper-individualism, further atomizing society and leaving us overwhelmed.
Smartphones and the internet put a library, movie theater, sports arena, radio and television studios and more in our purses and pockets. Ease of distraction, short attention spans and a view of the world as if one were seeing it by looking through a straw are some of the undesirable effects. They connect the world and give everyone a voice. A lack of filter or fact-check tarnishes that connectivity. Our behaviors with these technologies make education more difficult.
Our computer and related technologies are now so pervasive and influential that they have personalized the awareness of a need for change. We must act to keep our use of technologies and the impact they have on society in view — and, when needed, in check. 
Some have suggested a Food and Drug Administration equivalent to regulate technology. But creative, inventive genius that produces technology has done much that is extraordinarily beneficial and it’s difficult to predict when our use or misuse turns the effects of a technology negative. Others argue that the scientists and engineers who produce technology have an obligation to assess the societal impact of their inventions and act more responsibly. This, too, would require a significant improvement in human foresight and underestimates the incentives that keep the technology-development engine running. 
The best approach is for citizens to be highly conscious and well-informed about the impacts of their technology choices when deciding how they live and what they buy. It is a huge behavioral change. For example, technology assisted over-consumption and excessive materialism in America are truths, “inconvenient” ones such as climate change. Our universities can lead by doing more research and teaching more courses on the relationship between technology and society. They can provide community colleges and high schools with their work, encourage routine public education and discourse on how technology and our use of it are changing values, politics, economics and education in our country. Making informed technology choices must become part of our roles and responsibilities as American citizens. 
We should break up our communications/information/entertainment monopolies now, reducing their concentrated influence. We must also reduce the size of other modern monopolies that have used information technology to achieve their market dominance. These companies have more influence over the lives and behaviors of more people than any profit-making institution should have in America.

Technology long ago enabled us to satisfy our basic needs and significantly reduce the impact of nature’s uncertainty. We have recently focused it on information-based systems of economic efficiency and competition, on entertainment and diversion. The techno-optimists urge us on, arguing that technological change and the impact it has on our society is a non-biological aspect of human evolution to which we must just adapt. 
I believe we have a choice. We do not have to allow the tools and amusements we create to weaken our hold on truth, trust and the human kindness that grows in community. Saving the Idea that is America and much more is at stake.

Ultimately — much like elsewhere around the world — Latin America’s ability to mitigate this pandemic will come down to the quality of its leadership, the preparedness and effectiveness of its healthcare system and the stability of its population, all of which are variable throughout the region. But there are six countries that are of particular concern at the moment. Pressure and assistance from the international community might soon be warranted.
At the top of the list of worrisome countries is Venezuela, whose embattled President Nicolas Maduro continues to lead the once prosperous and oil-rich country into an economic free fall with its hyperinflation rate hovering at 10 million percent. As a result of Maduro’s failed socialist policies (and those of Hugo Chavez before him), Venezuela’s healthcare system is in a dire state of disrepair with hospitals lacking basic supplies and medicines, and with unreliable access to clean water, the maintenance of basic sanitation and electrical shortages plaguing the country. These conditions have already led to a worrisome rise in preventable diseases — maternal mortality and H.I.V, to name two. Under such circumstances, it’s hard to imagine that Venezuela’s healthcare system won’t absolutely collapse under COVID-19 pressures and might prove to be the straw that breaks the state’s back. Until recently, those in most desperate need have migrated abroad, the majority to neighboring Colombia, but with new border closures due to the pandemic, those pressures will remain a Venezuelan problem. Maduro has ordered a national quarantine, but sadly such actions will not be sufficient given the country’s many challenges. Perhaps all of this might finally lead to Maduro’s downfall, which would be the only positive outcome of an otherwise devastating situation. 
The next two countries of concern are Mexico and Brazil, which boast the strongest economies in the region. They are also home to Latin America’s largest and most dense populations, together totaling close to 350 million. While their healthcare systems are more robust than neighboring Venezuela, these countries are experiencing a failure of leadership, as both presidents downplay the severity of the health threat and thereby put their countries and the wider region at serious risk.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopéz-Obrador has dismissed COVID-19 concerns as “hysteria” sparked by the media and his political opponents and is advocating a “live your life as normal” approach — encouraging hugging, shopping, attending political rallies, and the like. Similarly, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has called the pandemic “media hysteria,” despite the fact that several of his top aides (including some who recently traveled to President Donald Trump’s property Mar a Lago) have tested positive for the virus. Bolsonaro has also denounced the governors of Brazil’s two largest cities, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, for their move to lock down with school closures and strict social distancing guidelines. And just days ago, Bolsonaro threatened to dismiss his health minister if he publicly criticized him. 
In response, Brazilians are taking to the streets to protest their president’s cavalier approach and seem to be turning to their local and regional authorities for guidance. They are displaying a loss of confidence in Bolsonaro’s ability to lead effectively. If Lopéz-Obrador does not shift his own rhetoric very soon, he risks a similar response in Mexico. Though these leaders sit on opposite sides of the political spectrum —with Bolsonaro on the far-right and Lopéz-Obrador on the left — both are exposing themselves to potential political fallout for the populist movements they represent, and a health disaster that experts see coming. 
The final cohort includes the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, also known as the Northern Triangle. They are among the poorest in the region, with roughly 60 percent of Guatemala and Honduras living in poverty and accounting for the bulk of asylum seekers at the U.S. border. While their leaders appear to be taking appropriate measures by enacting school and border closures and encouraging social distancing, these countries are of concern because they are home to some of the world’s most vulnerable populations.

Trump says he's considering executive action to suspend evictions,...
El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele has likely led the swiftest regional response to the outbreak, blocking entry to foreigners and ordering a month-long quarantine to El Salvadorans traveling home from abroad. Nevertheless, like neighboring Honduras and Guatemala, El Salvador’s vulnerability stems from its high homicide rates, drug-trafficking-related gang violence, rampant corruption, weak rule of law, and low levels of institutional confidence. Together these factors create weak and, in some ways, defenseless societies that are not prepared to manage the deadly threat posed by this pandemic and the results could be a devastating human toll. While the U.S. border remains closed to asylum seekers, the virus also threatens to add to existing pressures for exit from the Northern Triangle. Between 2007–2015, immigration to the United States from these countries increased by 25 percent, and an untenable health epidemic may fuel those numbers to rise once the border reopens.
As concern continues to mount that Latin America may become the next COVID-19 hotspot, the world would be wise to take notice and to assist where it can. In the immediate term, increased international pressure on Bolsonaro and Lopéz-Obrador can compel them to shift their rhetoric and their national responses. In the more medium term—and once the United States and the wider international community weathers the worst of their own COVID-19 threats—they should be prepared to assist their neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. President Trump
should reconsider recommitting the U.S. aid to Central America that was scaled back just last year. COVID-19 poses not just a Latin American health threat, but also has the potential to initiate significant shifts in the political dynamics of the region and to add to future immigrant influxes at the U.S. and other neighboring borders unless pressure and humanitarian support is offered.

This was the middle of the 1990s, and the passenger sitting in the back seat was Andrew Cuomo
, the United States secretary of Housing and Urban Development. At the time, I served as a Huntington councilman, and I had been summoned to a meeting with my colleagues and Cuomo about a proposal to build low income housing in an area known as East Northport. It was an issue roiling our community.
Cuomo stepped out and smiled through all the obligatory handshakes and photos. He was warm and gracious. Then we stepped into the office of the town supervisor. Cuomo took a seat and wiped off the smile from his face. He asked the room why the housing development proposal had not been approved. The town attorney had told him that Huntington was complying with relevant state and federal laws. Cuomo was unmoved. He demanded that the town either do more or face grave consequences from the Justice Department. He walked out of the building, and his black SUV drove away.
One of my colleagues remarked that Cuomo bullied us. I thought about that moment as I watched his career advance from Cabinet secretary to New York attorney general and eventually governor. Today he is a leader whose daily coronavirus briefings command global attention. He is not a bully. But he is triggered when he sees someone standing in the way of a remedy to a crisis. He has an overpowering desire to fix what is broken.
Fixing what is broken defines New York. A few years ago, Vice President Joe Biden spoke about the inside of the LaGuardia Airport, “I must be in some third world country.” His metaphor was correct. LaGuardia Airport has emerged from an $8 billion modernization. The Tappan Zee Bridge and Kosciuszko Bridge have been rebuilt. A brand new Moynihan Station train terminal in Manhattan is underway. Arenas, highways, universities, and railways have been redeveloped, reengineered, and reconstructed from Long Island to Buffalo. Cuomo really puts the “new” in New York.
Fixing what is broken is why you see Cuomo dominating the media today. President Trump
started his response to the coronavirus with denial and delay. It improves one day, and then it devolves the next. Cuomo, on the other hand, is a walking command center. He craves handling crises. In January, he left an event in Manhattan and saw a van on its side on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. He then directed his police detail to stop, climbed a concrete barrier, and helped free that driver from the truck.
Trump on coronavirus death toll: 'It is what it is'
Unemployment debate sparks GOP divisions
He is like Superman with a Queens accent. I have had my occasional dust ups with Cuomo. As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, I once gave what I believed was an inconsequential quote to the New York Times. Yet it stirred his ire. The next day, a “senior New York Democrat” was quoted in the Daily News complaining that I was an awful chairman. But that is New York politics. It is like our roads, aggressive and loud, and if you do not move out of the way, you are bound to get dented.
Is Cuomo a bully? No. Is he perfect? No. But he has a bare knuckle way of repairing what is imperfect. It is how he rolled into Huntington Town Hall that day, and how he continues to roll now as the governor of New York.

It is an act that, to me and millions of my fellow citizens, means far more than just a sticker. For me this began as a child, when I observed my parents taking part in the vital ritual of casting a ballot, an experience that instilled in me the idea that everyone needs to vote to preserve our democracy in the United States.
With the coronavirus and urgent necessity of social distancing, we have already seen primary elections delayed in Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Legislators, party leaders, and election lawyers have also had discussions about the fate of the national conventions scheduled for this summer. Candidates up and down the ballots must look for fresh ways to campaign without rallies and town halls, while still getting their message to millions of Americans who are under quarantine. We even have heard concerns that our general election this fall might need to be postponed.
Let me be clear, I still want my sticker, but I also want all eligible voters to have access to their right to vote under the most difficult conditions in a century. It is time for us to begin an honest and expedient conversation about how we administer elections in this dangerous and extraordinary age. The United States held an election during the Civil War and during both World Wars. But can we come together to solve the unique voting problems presented by the pandemic sweeping all across the country?
It will be challenging without a single centralized apparatus when each state needs to define the specific means, access, and procedures for its voters. While federal statute specifies the day of our general election and requires that, every four years, electors must convene in their respective state capitals to cast their votes for our president and vice president, the safety and accessibility of polling places is left to every state to decide.
Polling places appear to be a hazard to our public health at this point. But consider the hazards of asking citizens not to vote in a time of crisis. What can we do? One answer may be to expand the use of safe and secure mail voting programs. We have seen high participation rates in such programs. It is critical that legislators pass laws to create mail voting systems where they do not already exist and offer broader absentee voting procedures.
Legislators must also adopt criteria to protect the process from fraud or interference by ensuring that ballots are accepted and counted based on postmarks. They should enact measures to guarantee that all ballots are properly completed, handled securely, and accurately counted. Several states already allow no excuse absentee balloting. The bill introduced by Senator Ron Wyden and Senator Amy Klobuchar seeks to address these same issues and increase the ability of every voter across the country to participate in elections even when they remain isolated or quarantined.
Most view news media as biased, but critical to democracy: poll
Trump: Election results could be delayed by months
Indeed, a national absentee voting system already exists, and some states have successful mail voting programs. We should not have to reinvent the wheel or throw out any of our rights and safeguards. But time is short. The stimulus package now passed by Congress includes $400 million to help states safely conduct the 2020 election and to “prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus, domestically or internationally.” Regardless, states do not have any specific details on how that will be implemented.
In less than six months, early voting will begin in more than 9,000 districts across the country, each with its own rules and procedures. Clarity will be key, education will be essential, and bipartisan support will be mandatory.

In colonial times, Americans overcame smallpox and yellow fever. In the 19th century, there were outbreaks of cholera and scarlet fever. In the 20th century, there was the Spanish flu, polio, measles, and human immunodeficiency virus, which all caused terrible suffering but failed to break the spirit of Americans.
As President Trump
made clear during his national emergency declaration over the coronavirus, Americans in the 21st century are facing yet another challenge. Like our predecessors in this country, we need to confront this new challenge without allowing it to destroy our prosperity.
It will take a collective and unified effort on the part of all Americans. We need to be vigilant in our hygiene, overzealous in our quarantining, and understanding of the need of our fellow citizens to distance themselves from us. If we all pitch in and do our part, as Americans have done when faced with other great challenges in the past, then there is no reason to believe that the coronavirus cannot be kept under control.
The national emergency declaration will free up more than $40 billion to ensure we have the resources to manage. If, heaven forbid, you or a loved one required hospitalization because of the coronavirus, then you would expect to be admitted, no questions asked, as the national emergency declaration provides the resources to make that a reality.
From the moment the coronavirus emerged in China, President Trump has taken it seriously. At a time when some believed that such a far away crisis posed only a minimal risk to the United States, President Trump restricted travel from China out of an abundance of caution. The fact that our death toll is orders of magnitude lower than it is in some countries that refused to take such steps shows that caution was not misplaced. His decision to block travel from Europe, which the World Health Organization is calling the new epicenter of the pandemic, was equally prudent.
The national emergency declaration is neither a surrender to panic nor a concession of defeat. This is a forceful decision that Americans and their government must work together to save lives and ensure we emerge this summer as a strong and prosperous country. If we heed its guidelines and make the modest sacrifices recommended by our medical professionals, some might even wonder why it was necessary a few months from now. As the experience of our allies in Italy has taught us, however, if we fail to take this coronavirus seriously, then we run the risk that in a few months the national emergency declaration will not be enough.
The United States has the best doctors and the most advanced medical technology in the world. We also have the most practiced and dedicated military, police officers, and first responders. With the national emergency declaration, these world class experts will have the resources they need to help us face down this latest global threat from abroad.

As President Trump has told us, this is not the time for calling for division or assigning blame. It is our moment to give attention to the needs of our fellow citizens and step up to minimize the danger to our families, friends, and neighbors. As Vice President Pence reminded us from his experience as a governor, each of us need to be responsible in our own states and respond to the specific situations in our communities.
This is a temporary moment of uncertainty and, like many other critical moments in our history, we have faced such uncertainty head on with courage. We have always come through our challenges with resilience and confidence. Under the leadership of President Trump, I am certain that we will also face this new challenge with the kind of strength and unity that makes us Americans. We can and will prevail.

0,03/17/20 06:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/488115-the-pelosi-administration,The Pelosi administration,"Since the 2018 midterm elections, when the Democrats took back the majority in the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) set the agenda of the government. First, with the impeachment of President Trump
, and now, with the House passage of a bill to deal with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. 
She deftly held her cards on impeachment during the Mueller investigation, but went all in after news broke that a whistleblower complaint against President Trump was filed by a White House official. The complaint made last summer alleged Trump tried to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden
’s son. 
Not long after leading the effort that led to the president’s impeachment, Speaker Pelosi turned her sight to the coronavirus, and was the first out of the box setting policy markers for a response to the pandemic. 
Her exquisite timing and ability to command the agenda of government means that since the midterms, we have been living through the “Pelosi administration.”
The impeachment hearings in the House sucked the air out of the Trump administration, forcing it to play defense as the hearings dominated the news. All the temporary good news about the economy was buried by impeachment. The Speaker had the Administration on the wrong foot.
Now, under Speaker Pelosi’s leadership, House passage of legislation that responds to the coronavirus pandemic once again has the Trump administration dancing to the wrong music. They were forced to negotiate over paid sick leave, expanded funding for Medicaid and make more money available for food security programs — hardly their preferred solutions. 
Pelosi took advantage of Trump’s disinterest in proposing and shepherding legislation to provide her own and thereby set the terms of the debate — just as she did with the rewrite of the NAFTA trade bill.
It is hard to think of a modern Speaker of the House who has wielded power as effectively as Pelosi. Former Speaker Paul Ryan
(R-Wisc.), served mostly in the shadow of President Trump. Only Speakers who serve as leaders in opposition to the administration in power have an opportunity to be assertive; examples include Speaker John Boehner
(R-Ohio), who served during President Obama’s tenure, and Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.) during President Clinton’s presidency. 
But neither Boehner
nor Gingrich came anywhere close to setting the agenda of government as Pelosi has done. Neither Boehner nor Gingrich could keep their troops in line, and both overreacted by instigating government shutdowns that backfired and undermined their bid for power.
In contrast, Pelosi has managed to hold her caucus together and use its discipline to challenge the president effectively. She has been able to play defense successfully within the Democratic caucus, which has permitted her to mount an aggressive offense against Trump. 
Pelosi: Birx 'enabling' coronavirus disinformation from Trump
The Pelosi administration is an anomaly. House Speakers are generally not successful at setting the agenda of government. She has taken advantage of her caucus’ discipline and Trump’s inability to set the pace, and spearhead the agenda herself.
Yet, while Pelosi may enjoy the power she wields, she would gladly return to the shadows that Speakers normally inhabit, should Biden win the Democratic nomination, and perhaps the White House come November.

Levels of uncertainty are high, and Americans are looking to elected officials, particularly in the federal government, for leadership and direction now more than ever. This will no doubt be the greatest leadership test that Donald Trump
will face as president. His handling of this crisis will not only define his legacy in the White House, but will also make or break his chances for reelection.
For Democrats, Joe Biden cemented his front runner status in the primary by dominant wins in Mississippi, Missouri, and Michigan, and his lead will soon be insurmountable for Bernie Sanders to overcome. But winning the nomination will force Biden to confront the serious challenge of uniting the party before he can fully transition to a general election campaign.
While the rise of coronavirus has all but halted daily campaigning, Biden and Sanders remain ready to debate in their first single matchup tonight. This debate is a test of Biden and his strategy of uniting the party and a test of how Sanders can balance advocating his progressive agenda with not hurting the general election prospects of Biden. If Democrats are able to coalesce before the convention this summer all the way to November, their chances of defeating Trump increase dramatically, though this still might not be enough to ensure that he stays president for just one term.
However, severe mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis has the ability to weaken Trump enough to damage his electoral fortunes, even more so than impeachment, Democrats, or even Biden. The administration has so far handled this pandemic incredibly poorly, and it has now contributed to tanking markets and halting economic activity. Moreover, Trump himself has likely worsened the disaster by making public statements about the coronavirus spread that are either very misleading or completely false.
Trump has compared the coronavirus to the flu, a comparison that health officials disagree with, given the higher fatality rate of coronavirus, which is estimated to be around 1 percent. Trump has also claimed that millions of coronavirus tests have been distributed around the country, and that anyone who wants to get tested can, a categorically false claim indicated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose limited public data indicates that as of Friday, less than 2,000 people have been tested, with another 9,000 tests coming in from private labs across the country.
Presidents throughout history have faced make or break moments during times of crisis. Mismanagement of a crisis can seriously harm a president in the eyes of the public, and can cast a lingering shadow on his legacy. Take, for instance, George Bush failing to quickly respond to Hurricane Katrina. This illustrated the perils that presidents can face when they fail to deal with national crises in an efficient and compassionate way. Over a decade later, his legacy remains tainted. As people saw the aftermath in horror, Bush continued a vacation at his ranch, and decided to return to Washington days after the devastating storm claimed lives and homes.

For Trump, his misleading statements have simply worsened this crisis by creating a high degree of confusion among Americans across the country, who have shown a high degree of panic and alarm. Indeed, his failures as president are compounded by the global nature of the pandemic, which has now decimated much of the growth in the economy that Trump and Republicans once touted as his most essential argument for reelection.
While Democrats might still not have a strong enough case on their own to defeat Trump, his continued mismanagement of this pandemic could be strong enough to keep him from clinching a second term. Americans are scared, concerned, and need leadership. The federal government and Trump have so far failed them. However, it has become clear over recent days that this public health crisis is still far from over. The way that Trump manages this pandemic moving forward will make or break his chances for reelection and, perhaps more importantly, will define his presidency.

is on the verge of becoming a two time runner up in a contest that appeared, weeks ago, like his to lose. Following his troubling comments related to Fidel Castro and his communist leadership in Cuba, combined with a failure to expand his base, have forced Sanders and his supporters to deflect by railing against Joe Biden
and what they believe to be a vast “conspiracy” to block the nomination of the senator from Vermont.
Attacks against what Sanders believes to be the “establishment” have done little to slow Biden in his meteoric rise from the ashes. A campaign that many labeled as dead has gone from playing catch up to building a formidable lead. After months of speculation over a potential contested convention, the African American supporters of Biden have revived his fledgling candidacy and helped catapult him to front runner status.
With months left until the convention in Milwaukee, the question is how Sanders and his supporters will respond to Biden getting the nomination. In 2016, Sanders dragged the process out, refusing to concede to Hillary Clinton and complicating her ability to unite the party over her eventual nomination. Her failure to win over the crucial progressive wing led some Sanders supporters to vote for Jill Stein or not vote at all. In an election that was won, or lost depending on your view, by close to 77,000 votes across three states, it is hard to argue that Sanders refusing to play team politics had no negative consequences on the outcome of the election.
Only Sanders and his supporters know how they will react to losing the nomination again, but if history has taught us anything, it is that there is no guarantee that his supporters will vote for the eventual nominee this fall. If Democrats have any hope of defeating Donald Trump
in November, they need the backing of Sanders and his legion of voters. But it is unclear that Sanders will give a strong endorsement of Biden if he locks down the nomination. It is much more likely that Sanders goes scorched earth on the party, pleasing his base but decreasing the likelihood that Democrats can win the White House and both chambers of Congress in the election.
Should Sanders decide to vigorously campaign for Biden and bring his supporters into the larger fold, they would be welcomed with open arms. Sanders would have the opportunity to cement his status as a kingmaker within the party. His ability to ignite his progressive base and rally them behind the Democratic nominee would mark an instant game changer.
Should Sanders take a different route and decide to repeat the strategy that contributed to the election of Trump, he would likely be considered no longer welcome among Democrats. Sanders has often been criticized for running as an independent for Senate, while simultaneously running as a Democrat for the White House. Those criticisms would only be amplified if Sanders fails to bow out of the race in a timely fashion or, even worse, fails to enthusiastically endorse Biden by the convention this summer.
While Sanders likely would not feel the effects of this disastrous political strategy, his disciples certainly would. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Pramila Jayapal, and Ilhan Omar, all Sanders supporters, would undoubtedly suffer the consequences should he tank Biden this fall. The squad, as they are famously known as, has already caused headaches for moderates in Congress hoping to be reelected. If Biden loses to Trump, those progressives unwilling to unite with the party could be blamed.
Ex-Spanish king leaving Spain amid investigation
A victory for Biden would decrease the pressure on progressives to fall in line, and could provide Ocasio Cortez with the wiggle room needed for a potential presidential run on her own one day. Her future aspirations, as well as the aspirations of many Americans, are reliant on Sanders putting the country first and his ego second. With any politician in Washington, that is a very risky bet. With Sanders, it is like a game of Russian roulette.
How Sanders wants to be remembered in history is in his hands. He can be remembered for championing a progressive movement that inspired a new generation of leaders, or he can be remembered for contributing to the election and reelection of the most damaging leader that our country has ever known. Only Sanders knows which path he will take, but make no mistake, Democrats are nervously watching how this chapter goes down.

The combination of myriad, simultaneous crises (coronavirus pandemic, the stock market free fall, election hacking and freakish weather events), a peevish hyperpartisan Congress that is stalled, and an increasingly politicized and hysterical opinion-based media have created a vicious and anxiety-ridden culture. 
And it doesn’t stop there — internet algorithms on the three biggest social media platforms, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, sort us into tribes and pit us against each other, adding further to our society’s chaos.  
Top it off with the Donald Trump
ad hoc style of presidential leadership, which the comedian John Mulaney described as “like there’s a horse loose in a hospital,” and it feels intolerable.
In response, we are turning on each other. 
Most of us are feeling much colder toward, more fearful and contemptuous of those with opposing views, and these sentiments have more than doubled since 1994. We also believe that almost twice as many people on the other side of the political fence hold more extreme views than they actually do. And the more media we consume, the more our perceptions of them become distorted. 
These feelings are increasingly influencing who we date, marry, hire and hang out with. A recent survey even showed that almost 10 percent of both Democrats and Republicans feel that violence would be acceptable if the other side won the 2020 presidential election. 
Of course, this is making us all sick. Today, 69 percent of Americans find the future of the country to be a “significant source of stress,” which leads to an increased likelihood of chronic health problems. 
Between 2018 and 2019, the number of adults who described themselves as more anxious than the previous year rose to 32 percent. Today 40 million Americans (about 1 in 5) report suffering from an anxiety disorder, although the actual numbers are likely much higher. In 2017, over 17 million adults and three million adolescents were diagnosed with major depression in the U.S. This has contributed to the increasing suicide rate, which went up by 33 percent between 1999 and 2017 and fuels our skyrocketing opioid crisis. 
Nevertheless, I see this all as good news. If we are ever going to dislodge ourselves from this toxic quagmire of political contempt, it is important to be miserable. 
Researchers who have studied how to get out of destructive, polarizing and entrenched conflicts have found that two things really matter in motivating enemy tribes to call a ceasefire and look for other ways of resolving their differences: sufficient levels of mutual misery and a possible way out of it. 
This research, based on something called ripeness theory, has found that the best conditions for bridging the gulf between enemies locked in battle is when a mutually hurting stalemate is coupled with a sense of a mutually enticing opportunity. A mutually hurting stalemate happens when the disputants in the conflict — like red and blue Americans — see the situation they are in as hopelessly stuck and unlikely to ever be “won” by either side, and are experiencing enough pain, regret or dread to motivate them to find an alternative way out. However, they must also believe that enough of the disputants on the other side of the divide are feeling the same level of angst and longing for resolution. 
The good news is Americans are plenty miserable. After the 2018 midterm elections, a group called More in Common found that 86 percent of Americans said they felt totally exhausted by political divisions and they’re worried it will lead to violence. And, as ripeness theory would predict, this seems to matter. The same study also found that 89 percent of Americans said they were eager for both parties to come together and find opportunities to compromise. 
This group represents what the study calls the “hidden tribes” in the political middle, which are not the more noisy and extreme groups on either side. This growing “miserable middle majority” provides a solid foundation for change, and it suggests that a significant segment of the population may be open to a correction of some type.

However, there is also a second necessary condition for breaking out of the trap. All miserable parties to protracted disputes must also begin to sense that there might be a mutually enticing opportunity to exit the conflict. In other words, they need to begin to feel that there may be a way out or a way to get unstuck, change course and move on with their lives without having to give up too much.
The good news here is that most divided societies, even those experiencing direct violence, harbor individuals and groups who are working actively to bridge the tensions and promote understanding and compassion. So, the question for all fed up Americans today is, where are those people in your community? Finding and joining with them in common cause should be your next step.

is much more likely to cinch the elected officials and corporate donors needed to give Donald Trump
a run for his money come November. But the Bernie Sanders
faction of the party will not handle a second straight primary loss with grace.
Progressives only have themselves to blame. The leftward lurch of many Democratic voters over the last decade was not entirely orchestrated by party leaders, but often given credence as a tool to foster support from the remnants of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Left wing politicians and their allies in the legacy media did nothing to prevent the rhetoric that animates their second best candidate. Social justice “wokeness” started to pervade a party that once claimed to be the ally of Rust Belt industrial employees. Even traditional liberal planks have taken radical turns. Gone are calls for abortion to be “safe, legal, and rare.”
Instead, the would be Jacobins tell women to “shout your abortion” and push for third trimester terminations. Rational positions on curbing illegal immigration, like a border fence and increased border control, have been consumed by calls for drivers licenses, free health care, and even the right to vote for illegal immigrants. Meaningful calls for gender equality have in many cases been overshadowed by drag queen story hours being forced on kids at local libraries. Moreover, demands for massive new entitlements that would cost trillions of dollars is a recipe for disaster, especially as the left continues to encourage both legal and illegal immigration.
Elevating radical voices like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar have forced Democrats to turn into the party of unworkable policy platforms such as Medicare for All, free college tuition, and even reparations for slavery. Now Biden finds himself in a very difficult position where he will either have to appease demands of radical left wing voters, who make up an increasingly significant and vocal portion of his party, or risk losing their support at the ballot box in the general election.
In 2016, Democratic leaders had predicted that Republican voters would become deeply fractured due to Trump. Instead, it was their own voters who were deeply divided. At least 12 percent of Sanders primary voters decided to support Trump that year, with many more staying home or voting third party. Expect that figure to rise this November. The Bernie bros could again swing the general election in favor of Trump.
In order to deal with the deep party divisions, Biden has already made several deals with the devil that could cripple his campaign. To win the Texas primary, for instance, he accepted the support of “hell yes we will take your guns” Beto O’Rourke, promising to put him in control of firearm control policies. Biden has also accepted a radical position on studying reparations for slavery. With Sanders surrogates like Ocasio Cortez saying that they will be forced to support Biden in November, what concessions would he need to give them for their support? Would he have to choose a young progressive vice presidential nominee to balance out the two wings of the party, therefore having to risk the loss of moderate voters?
Allowing the cancer of radical leftism to seep into Democrats will have concrete effects on the political landscape. A younger Biden may have been able to find a solution and bridge the gap between the factions. However, in a weak position flanked by Sanders supporters, while also aiming for the crucial Midwest voters who enthusiastically backed Trump four years ago, this seems to be increasingly difficult. The party that Biden appears poised to lead in 2020 is not the same as the one that he sought to lead back when he ran in 1988 or even two decades later in 1998.
For a campaign that needs corporate backing and a new generation of voters, Biden is stuck in an unenviable position. The enabling of extreme progressive ideology comes with a steep price. This Gordian Knot is one that only the most skilled of politicians can loosen. For all of his strengths, no one has ever described Biden as a skilled political mastermind.
Come November, the beneficiary of the party splintering will be able to shape national politics for the next four to eight years in the White House. Disaffected voters may again stay home, sinking yet another Democratic candidate for president. If these voters do not pull the lever for Biden, it will be due to false expectations allowed to run wild for too long in hope of firing up the Democratic base. Indeed, such a fracturing would only have one logical outcome in that the winner may again be Trump.

0,03/04/20 06:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/486015-america-needs-paid-sick-leave-laws-to-stop-coronavirus-from-spreading,America needs paid sick leave laws to stop coronavirus from spreading,"Coronavirus has laid bare the extent to which the failure of our nation to require paid sick leave has now endangered all of us. Congress needs to urgently pass paid sick leave laws, but states and cities must not wait for that and take action now. In some jurisdictions, this may require making compromises, such as a sunset provision or some aid to small employers.
Americans have long been laboring while sick, potentially passing illness to colleagues and the public, because they fear getting fired for missing work and cannot afford unpaid leave. According to the Federal Reserve, almost 40 percent of people cannot cover a $400 unexpected expense. Being present is not the result of our work ethic on overdrive. It is usually caused by a power disparity leaving workers at the mercy of employers.
In recent years, nearly a dozen states and almost two dozen cities across the nation have passed paid sick leave laws, typically requiring employers to provide about five days, accrued over time, as well as protection from retaliation. Most employers have actually found these laws to be, in the words of one report, no big deal to follow. Some even press for change, like the Maine bakery owner who explained, “It does not make sense for me to force a sick baker to come to work and sneeze all over our bread.”
These laws work. A 2017 study compared jurisdictions with and without mandates, finding that cold and flu disease rates decreased after workers gained access to paid sick leave, declining as much as 40 percent during flu season. In light of coronavirus, many commentators have noted that the lack of paid sick leave makes us particularly vulnerable. The pressing question is, given our current political realities, how to get all this done.
Congress should pass a law requiring employers to provide up to three weeks of paid sick days, or longer if the person is still contagious, with protection from retaliation. But states and cities, including those already requiring five paid sick days, should not wait. They need to immediately pass laws requiring paid sick leave to protect their people and diminish the spread of disease. In places where this seems impossible, lawmakers could consider sensible compromises, like a sunset provision. The newly enacted paid sick leave requirement would expire upon the end of the pandemic or after a set period of time with the possibility of extension.
This approach could work since it avoids the thorny battles inherent in broad range policymaking. Paid leave advocates would prefer a lasting solution, but a short term provision would be a start. Moreover, proof of such a concept could lead some lawmakers or employers to extend the policy. Business associations typically oppose paid leave obligations, which is an utterly irresponsible position right now and contrary to the beliefs of their own members, but a time limit might lessen resistance.
But who would pay for it, especially as many businesses are struggling? Many employers would not even feel a pinch since they already voluntarily provide paid sick leave, and a growing number are probably now joining them. Any legal requirement would affect the bottom line of those limited number of adamant employers outside of these groups. It is in the interest of employers to provide paid leave, as one sick employee at work can lead to many more. Further, from a more high level perspective, limiting the spread of coronavirus will reduce the negative impact on the economy.
Yet some small or struggling businesses still could not shoulder the cost. While employers should not generally receive public subsidies simply to provide decent working conditions, this could be an unusual moment to consider temporarily spreading the financial burden. How might we do all this? Perhaps through a tax credit, public grant, low interest loan, or other subsidy program for small businesses or those with demonstrated need. One existing model to use is the federal work opportunity tax credit that incentivizes the hiring of employees from groups facing barriers to jobs.

Short-term health plans are a threat, not a victory, for sick patients
Coronavirus illustrates the harm of allowing large companies, including those in the gig economy, to misclassify their workers as independent contractors instead of employees. We also need a sustainable solution to this, but there is an immediate need. Drivers, delivery workers, and house cleaners interact with the public, leading to higher than average potential exposure and spread. They need paid leave to stay home while sick. One approach to consider is the Massachusetts paid family and medical leave law, which covers businesses that use 1099 forms, indicating independent contractor status, for over 50 percent of the labor force across the state.
Ideally, our nation would have had robust paid sick leave laws long ago. But this is not a perfect world. Congress should take action, as should states and cities. If they need to make imperfect compromises, like a sunset provision or subsidy program, they should not hesitate to do so. After all, what is worse, an imperfect solution or a paralyzing pandemic?

0,03/02/20 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/485530-can-this-joe-biden-comeback-last,Can this Joe Biden comeback last?,"Like the story of Lazarus in the Bible, the campaign of Joe Biden
has been raised from the dead in South Carolina after disappointing performances in the first three primary states. Biden, a three time presidential candidate, who up until South Carolina had still not yet won a primary election in this cycle, delivered a much needed victory in the Palmetto State. The former vice president did not just squeak out a win as some political forecasters predicted. Instead, Biden won every single county in South Carolina.
Such a dominant victory should not be overlooked. I have seen first hand what a campaign on its last breath looks like. How a campaign responds in that moment says a lot about the ability of a candidate to navigate a crisis. Biden not only rose to the occasion, he exceeded expectations and gave voters a reason to explain away his performance up to this point as simply a campaign struggling to find its groove. Make no mistake about it, this was his last stand. Anything short of a win by 10 points would have ended his campaign and handed the nomination to Sanders. Thankfully, Biden will live to fight another day. The question now becomes how long.
With Super Tuesday around the corner and an organizing advantage that favors Sanders, the question that many pundits have been asking since the polls closed in South Carolina over the weekend is whether Biden can write the script for one of the best comeback stories in political history. The answer is yes, but it requires a lot of risk and a little more luck.
Telling stories about his time as vice president to Barack Obama is nice, but the optics of a press conference in a location set up to look like the White House briefing room is even better. In 2008, Obama was criticized for using a logo resembling the presidential seal while still seeking the Democratic nomination. The more voters saw Obama in front of the seal, the more comfortable they became with the idea that he could win. The same applies to Biden. Sometimes you have to fake it until you make it.
Some may believe that Biden is first in line for the Democratic nomination this year, but they could not be more wrong. Voters look at the roles and responsibilities of their president and vice president very differently. We know this because not many vice presidents have been elected president. If Biden wants to be president, then he should act like he is president.
When President Trump
does a press gaggle before taking off on the South Lawn or takes questions in the Oval Office, Biden should find the nearest lectern and cut into that airtime nonstop. Free media launched Trump into the White House, and that kind of coverage could do the same for Biden. If the topic is the coronavirus, announce who will serve on your transition team. If the topic is the the stock market, announce who will serve on your economic council. Time is now of the essence. Biden cannot simply tell Americans that he is an alternative to Trump. He must show them why he is better. Take the greatest asset of Trump, his great ability to shape media coverage, and make it his greatest liability. If you think that dueling press conferences will not rattle Trump, then you do not understand him.
Because of his lack of infrastructure, Biden needs his surrogates deployed on every network and interviewing with every reporter, explaining the risk that a Sanders nomination poses for the country and the liability on the ticket. Biden finally began making that case during his victory speech in Columbia, but now is the time to hammer it home. Much like Obama did to John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton did to Bernie Sanders
in 2016, Biden and his surrogates should end every other sentence asking, “Are we really ready to bet the country on him?” They need to make this clear.
Democrats want Biden to debate Trump despite risks
Trump campaign manager: We want more debates against Biden, and sooner
Turning this into a national message that is easy to understand will not only make it easy to repeat on the airwaves, but it will resonate with many Americans worried about record drops in the stock market and the ability of this administration to respond to the coronavirus. If the race comes down to who can best ease these fears, who can provide a steady hand during a time of crisis, and who voters trust the most, Biden will not only perform well on Super Tuesday, but will be on his way to blocking Sanders from delegates and saving down ballot races across the country.
Biden need not win every state to claim success on Super Tuesday, but he needs to prove that his path to the nomination is strong. Keeping Texas within the margin of error, denying Sanders all the delegates in California, and running up the score in states like Virginia and North Carolina would turn what some dismiss as a one off victory in South Carolina into what Americans love more than anything, an incredible comeback story.

0,02/28/20 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/485187-presidential-candidates-should-focus-on-fixing-broken-systems,Presidential candidates should focus on fixing broken systems,"As the nation turns to South Carolina and other primary states, there is no secret that the discussion by Democrats will shift to issues that appeal to black and brown communities and the need to embrace more diversity, inclusion, and opportunity. But campaigns need to do more than simply diagnose the problem. So far from transformative policy proposals, the discussions on race mostly focus on individual candidate transgressions or surface as candidate political strategies to distinguish themselves by highlighting the alleged racial misgivings of their own party opponents.
However, in the South, race is reality. Persisting inequalities are evident in our institutions, from voting precincts to jails and prisons, our schools to jobs and wages, and our housing and transportation. This makes clear that our communities are divided by design. So to this day, many people in the South experience unequal justice, access to educational and economic opportunity, and even the democratic process. For many, the vestiges of the unfortunate Jim Crow era have yet to subside. Such divisive policies were intentional and have torn our communities apart here in the South.
As a result of this, the South continues to lag behind on many measures. Our states lead the nation with the amount of youth ages 16 to 24 without work or not attending school. Our incomes trail the rest of the nation. Our states lead in rates of incarceration. Consequently, staggering numbers of people in the South, mostly minorities, are disenfranchised from the right to vote, while the same disenfranchised bodies in the justice system are used as the political pawns for gerrymandering and redistricting efforts.
As rising generations in the South become more racially and ethnically diverse, it is more important than ever to address the discrepancies in outcomes for our people, and specifically for minority populations. It is important for our nation to not only confront its original sin, but to also confront the clear racial divides in opinion regarding the causes, or even existence, of the social and economic discrepancies that still exist today.
It is time to come together around a shared understanding to stimulate a desire, curiosity, and willingness to ask these significant questions. Why do black households with college degrees have median wealth equal to only 70 percent of white households without college degrees? Why do full time workers of color earn more than 20 percent less in wages than their white counterparts? Why is the average initial capitalization of our black entrepreneurs less than 60 percent of startup businesses led by whites?
Many current presidential candidates have proposed policies to address systemic barriers. Unfortunately, however, most proposals appear more like acknowledgements of existing barriers rather than concrete plans or commitments to solve these important issues. Of course, “establishing a federal program that allocates funding to help close the startup capital gap for entrepreneurs of color” will be great, while “creating a competitive federal grant program that reduces barriers restricting affordable housing in high opportunity areas” is also a step in the right direction for equality.

But voters in the South, particularly voters of color, have been promised plenty with few policies being delivered or being delivered then reneged. How will the next president commit to bringing people together around a common understanding? How will he or she redesign systems that have expanded and contracted to bar access to justice and opportunity? How will he or she bring us together to do what is difficult sustainably? Will the next president morally commit to moving people to find a higher common ground? In what ways will he or she help white communities understand that, in reality, lifting up black and brown families raises all citizens up?
We are all inextricably linked as people of this great nation. It is now time to have a broader and honest dialogue to address the enduring legacy of racism, the systemic barriers to opportunity, and the necessity of building a shared future. The positive thing is there is little political downside. We know that folks of all races and backgrounds have a lot in common. We all want good jobs, good health care, and to leave the world better for our kids. We are all better when we are in it together. Which candidate is the one who can make this happen? The best time to plant an oak tree was three decades ago. The next best time is now. Let us take this political moment to have these discussions and outline a new pathway forward.

0,02/27/20 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/485009-an-american-way-to-tackle-climate-change-and-battle-global-warming,An American way to tackle climate change and battle global warming,"The last year has been tough for climate activists around the world. The United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, protests by Extinction Rebellion generated publicity but not much else, and the United Nations Climate Change Conference ended in failure. This helps explain why the bombshell report by the International Energy Agency which found carbon dioxide emissions related to energy did not increase last year was a much needed morale boost for those people intent on halting global warming.
However, this is not a rallying cry for the environmentalists to redouble their efforts. A closer look at the numbers shows that the conventional approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which relies on heavy regulation and government direction, is a dead end. But there is still hope. The International Energy Agency data identifies proven and successful models that any country can adopt to reduce emissions and slow global warming. They just are not in vogue right now. Globally, the amount of emissions stayed at the 2018 levels, but this was not a team effort. The European Union led the way cutting 160 million tons of carbon dioxide, then the United States at 140 million tons, and Japan at 45 million tons. That had been just enough to offset “the rest of the world” combined.
Since the European Union made the greatest cuts, it is tempting to think that other countries must adopt its regulatory heavy approach that most climate activists favor, however, this would be a mistake. Unfortunately, that model is nearing its limits, and even Europeans are starting to push back. The European Union announced with great fanfare that it planned to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, or rather, every country except Poland, which abstained from the deal. Despite this refusal, Poland is still set to receive more than a quarter of the 100 billion euro fund with which the European Union will grease the skids toward a lower emitting economy.
Although paying off uncompliant countries may work for the European Union, it simply could not work as a solution for the world. According to International Monetary Fund data, there are more than 130 countries with lower gross domestic product per capita than Poland, and among them are nine of the 10 most populous countries in the world. If Poland needs help to buy expensive and unreliable renewable energy, then those other countries will too. Does anyone really think that the United States and the European Union could subsidize all of them into true carbon neutrality?
By striking contrast, Japan cut 4 percent of its greenhouse gasses largely after it started back into operation its nuclear energy industry, which had been severely curtailed after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. This is good for Japan as well as for the environment, as overreactions to the reactor accident, such as unnecessary evacuations and policies that drove up the cost of energy, almost certainly killed more people than the radiation did.
Countries such as Germany that followed Japan in shuttering their nuclear industries had to switch back to coal to maintain the reliable power grids. Even now, the European Union climate fund will not pay for nuclear power despite its safe use across France. Despite its earlier mistakes, Japan has bowed to the basic reality that any realistic carbon neutral society needs lots of reliable energy, which only nuclear fission can supply enough of.
Despite ambivalence on nuclear power and an uncoordinated approach to reducing emissions, the United States capped off an extraordinary stretch of two decades in which it reduced emissions by almost one billion tons, more than any other country. Last year, the United States nearly matched the European Union emissions reductions without an overarching strategy for greenhouse gasses, while still growing its economy at nearly double the rate of the eurozone. This is largely due to private sector success like natural gas getting cheap enough and widely available to supplant coal.

Developing countries can learn from American and Japanese success to grow their economies with environmentally friendly methods. The climate change movement has no hope of succeeding without finding a way to make this happen moving forward. There are more than six billion people in countries that the International Monetary Fund classifies as “emerging market and developing economies.” These people want and need access to safe reliable food, water, clothing, housing, medicine, and sanitation that development brings, not to mention other advances that a modern society offers. While the approach of the European Union might work for it, developing countries that need to dramatically raise their standards of living would be better off studying how the United States cuts emissions without sacrificing growth and how pragmatism in Japan works as well.

is now cruising toward reelection this fall. Four years ago, most liberals treated the prospect of his presidency as simply a punchline instead of a serious possibility. When they were proven spectacularly wrong in 2016, the same people tried to protect their egos with a conspiracy theory about “collusion” with Russia.
The 2020 election cycle started off with liberals wallowing in the same dismissive and unfounded certainty of their own triumph. Trump had no chance at reelection, they assumed, if he even made it to Election Day without being removed from office. Now following his acquittal and the realization that Democrats have to face the man who humiliated them, wishful thinking among liberals is quickly changing into outright panic.
Rising approval ratings, widespread agreement among Americans that they are better off under Trump, and the utter absence of the recession that his detractors have been predicting for years are breaking through the bubble of confidence that the liberal commentators had created for themselves and their fawning audiences. The race for the Democratic nomination is devolving into a blame game as the party scrambles to identify which of the candidates will not be a sure loser in November.
The collapse of Joe Biden has made Bernie Sanders
the new front runner, which has many liberals sweating bullets. The Democratic establishment is scrambling to find someone other than Sanders, as moderates such as Jonathan Chait sound the alarm. But leave it to James Carville, the spin doctor for Bill Clinton, to take the gloves off. “Good God! We have got to do something here,” Carville exclaimed, heavily implying that a Sanders nomination would be “the end of days” for the party and end in defeat.
But Sanders supporters are equally convinced that Trump will win unless Democrats nominate their radical candidate. After the disastrous failure to declare a winner in the Iowa caucuses, Sanders supporter and University of Iowa professor Jeffrey Cox observed, “After a botched impeachment process that leaves Trump even more electable, we come to the deeply humiliating failure of the state Democratic Party.” He added that unless the establishment is stopped, the party will lose yet another election.

Then liberals also have the Michael Bloomberg escape route, which would involve handing the nomination, most likely in a brokered convention, to a former Republican billionaire who is spending hundreds of millions of his own dollars in an effort to buy the election. But sadly for the Democrats, nominating an elitist billionaire would alienate large swaths of their voter base, arguably setting the party up for an even more disastrous defeat.
The absence of any viable candidate has led to the final emerging coping strategy on the left of complaining, as progessive media outlet Vox did recently, that the Constitution is fundamentally unfair, in part because it might mean that Trump can then win reelection. The internal squabbling coming out of the Democratic primaries suggests that the left now fears losing to Trump a second time more than they have at any point during his presidency. The worst part for them is that their fears are entirely justified.

However, the ferocious growth of the national debt monster is one likely to consume us all sooner rather than later. While President Trump
seems to be allowing the problem to grow, Democrats are ready to let it sink the economy and your financial stake in it.
Debt crises have a particular way of fomenting deep political and social change. Before the French Revolution, the country struggled with massive debt from spending on war, colonies, and major projects like the Palace of Versailles. As historian John Shovlin noted, “It is a truism that the French Revolution was touched off by the near bankruptcy of the state.”
During the European debt crisis in the last decade, Cyprus accepted a bailout that required its citizens to foot much of the bill. The original plan was for all private bank accounts to pay in to cover costs. In the rejected plan, accounts under 100,000 euros were to have more than 6 percent in assets seized by the state, and those accounts above 100,000 euros were to have nearly 10 percent taken. The actual deal took between 40 percent to 60 percent of assets from the accounts above 100,000 euros.
If Cyprus forced its own citizens to give up their already taxed earnings to cover that $23 billion debt bailout, imagine how our federal government would handle a debt load 1,000 times larger. The outstanding $23 trillion is one that neither political party in Washington is willing to tackle. Trump allowed for massive spending, even during healthy economic times. When the next terrible recession hits the country, the bailout package might not be for the large banks, but rather for Washington to keep functioning.
There might be a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. The White House budget intends to reduce government largesse with proposals to trim the edges, including $53 billion in contract abuses, $18 billion in improper tax refunds, and closer oversight on federal agency spending. In many ways, however, these are relative window dressing for an annual deficit that is approaching $1 trillion and likely growing. The fact that Congress will not accept this budget as written means the can will be kicked further down the road. After all, Congress rejected modest cuts three years ago.
While Trump is letting this problem to develop much further, Democrats seem to want to create an even more serious debt crisis during the next administration. For starters, the spending plans by the candidates make Trump and even Barack Obama look like skinflints. Gone are the days that John Kerry wanted to look like a fiscal hawk by attacking George Bush for $87 billion to be spent on the Iraq War. The Democrats who are seeking the White House this fall are using their soapboxes to call for multitrillion spending proposals without any spelled out means to pay for them.
Then there are promises of steep new taxes, onerous regulations that will kill the financial and energy gains of the last three years, and an unbridled sense of federal power, Democrats will pair this tremendous spending with an almost guaranteed recession. Considering that the last recession almost toppled multiple European countries, how will the United States handle a worse recession with much higher debt loads? Democrats have made plans based on the false assumption that economic growth can reduce the deficit, while they craft policies to induce another crash.
Even the Trump tax cuts were partially based on some similar assumptions without major budget cuts. When that happens, what will be the effect on your wallet? First, the reality of an economic “bail in” similar to Cyprus is always present. Second, the last time the government pushed debt above 100 percent of gross domestic product was due to the Second World War, when the government had asked citizens to pitch in by buying bonds.
Massive debt spending is often followed by a massive hangover, just as spending on social initiatives, the Vietnam War, and the oil crises of the 1970s led to harmful stagflation. A combination of taxes, high inflation, and unemployment sunk the economy before the reforms under Ronald Reagan. If Democrats are looking for a clear precedent for their current economic plans, including a ban on fracking, they can look no further.

Our public debt has been partially obfuscated by outside factors such as economic growth and budget gimmicks. However, as it grows, the options to handle it become fewer. The impending cost of the Social Security and Medicare needs of the Baby Boomers will provide a stark choice between reducing benefits, cutting taxes, or both. Since the Social Security trust fund is estimated to expire in 15 years, all the Democratic proposals to expand expenses will only hasten the day that checks are reduced.
Crushing debt is something that many Americans understand in their personal lives when it comes to delaying plans, paralyzing action, and lowering standards of living. Whether we like it or not, we contributed to the same concept, millions of times over, in Washington. When a credit card bill comes due, an individual could declare bankruptcy. When the government has its debt bill come due, all of us will be on the hook.

0,02/18/20 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/483511-a-new-strategy-for-central-asia,A new strategy for Central Asia,"This month, the Trump administration released its strategy for Central Asia. This marks the first time in more than two decades that the United States has come up with a serious approach to a region where vast economic, geopolitical, and civilizational stakes are at issue. It follows visits by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the first trip to the region by someone in that role in half a decade.
Long seen as a stagnant land of Soviet holdovers, Central Asia has been undergoing a dramatic transition led by its two most powerful countries, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Leaders in both countries have plunged into meaningful domestic reforms that are now focused on expanding citizen rights, governmental responsiveness, and the rule of law. They have also taken some important steps toward establishing their own structures for regional cooperation, a process that could result in a kind of Central Asian version of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Other world powers have certainly taken notice. Chinese President Xi Jinping launched the behemoth Belt and Road Initiative in the capital of Kazakhstan seven years ago. Moscow, desperate not to be marginalized by Beijing, is coercing regional states to join its Eurasian Economic Union, and has also launched a fanciful vision of a “Greater Eurasia” in which all would be subordinated to Russia and China. Indian, Japanese, and South Korean leaders have all extensively toured the region. The European Union released its own strategy for Central Asia last year, focused on supporting regional cooperation rather than mere bilateral ties.
Neither George Bush nor Barack Obama bothered to think strategically about Central Asia, shifting their attention instead to Afghanistan and the war on terror. Afghanistan has been intimately linked with Central Asia for 3,000 years, but for the past two decades, the United States treated the two as separate worlds. Subordinated to concerns in Afghanistan, Russia, and China, Central Asia became an afterthought. However, in an era where great power competition is seen as the most serious challenge to national security, the United States should care about countries sandwiched between Russia, China, India, Iran, and Pakistan.
The new strategy emphasizes American support for the sovereignty and independence of the Central Asian states. It encourages the growth of regional cooperation among them, and acknowledges positive steps toward political and economic reform. It also supports the expansion of relations between Central Asian states and Afghanistan. It emphasizes the importance of partnership with regional states to achieve progress on sensitive topics such as human rights and religious freedom.
In releasing this strategy, the Trump administration makes clear that it views Central Asia as a world region where the United States has intrinsic national security and economic interests. This is an important departure from the past practice of allowing this region to slip between the cracks. We have long argued for exactly this approach to the region and have ample reason to applaud the strategy drafters. However, the task has not been completed, for several omissions must be attended to.
First, Washington has yet to grasp the key role of Central Asia as a bastion of Muslim societies with secular governments, laws, and education. The United States should acknowledge this role, and work to sustain and promote secular government in Central Asia and elsewhere. Next, the United States has yet to fully recognize that, as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has noted, Afghanistan is itself a Central Asian country. Noting this, the logical next step is for the United States to fully include Afghanistan in its mechanism for consultations with Central Asian states.

The strategy does not mention the crucial east to west corridor linking Central Asia to Europe through the Caspian Sea and the South Caucasus. Expanding the Central Asian linkages with lands to the west should be a priority of American engagement. Finally, the strategy acknowledges the security challenges Central Asian states face from Russia and China, but it offers little detail on how the United States should address them.
Central Asia, including Afghanistan, presents geopolitically important real estate. Building on their rich indigenous cultures, its countries now look to the Americans to provide a balance to other major powers in the region. They believe that such an arrangement can provide the basis for better relations among all involved. Until now, the United States has hesitated to embrace this challenge. The new strategy indicates that at long last Washington is beginning to take Central Asia seriously. Having finally taken important first steps, it should now finish the job.

0,02/18/20 02:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/483480-what-happens-during-a-contested-democratic-national-convention,What happens during a contested Democratic National Convention?,"Iowa and New Hampshire have voted, but the Democratic field has not appreciably thinned. With no candidate even gaining 30 percent in the first two states, political forecasters have noted that the odds are greatly increasing that no one will have a majority heading into the Democratic convention in Milwaukee this summer. While discussion of a brokered convention comes up every four years, the parties have done little to plan for what one would actually look like. Thanks to changes in the process, a contested fight could be vastly more complicated than in the past.
Conventions, especially those without an incumbent, were rarely smooth operations. But there was an understanding of how the process worked. During the convention era, which effectively ran from 1832 to 1968, the choice of presidential candidates was usually made by a small group of bosses. The actual delegates were chosen by the state parties if there were no primaries or caucuses, and were usually divided in who they supported by state affiliation rather than interest in ideology or a specific candidate. Often times, these delegates were well known and actually owed their livelihood to the delegation leaders. But there were further rules that helped ensure that delegates stayed in line.
The state delegates were usually bound by the unit rule of internally voting on a candidate, then casting all their ballots as one for the winner. So winning over the state leader was often enough to capture the whole state at once. A “winner take all” system was usually in place for states that used a primary or caucus system. So even when there was a vote of the people, there was limited dissent among state delegates.
Unless a leader of the state had a chance at the nomination, the delegates were used as bargaining chips, often voting for a “favorite son” candidate in early ballots until they could be traded. This horse trading and tough calculations forced leaders to come to a consensus. For Democrats, especially before 1932, when they removed a rule requiring the winner to get two-thirds of the vote, this system could be disastrous. Republicans controlled the presidency during the heart of the era, holding it for all but 16 years from 1860 to 1932. But the general principles of how a convention operated, and that horse trading was needed, were well accepted.
Starting in the 1960s, the Democrats gradually changed these rules. Every state now uses the primary and caucus system, and the “winner take all” rule for apportioning delegates is not allowed by the Democrats. Instead, the delegates of each state are divided proportionally, thereby limiting the ability to swing votes. The unit rule has been banned, so the delegates of each state will no longer be forced to vote as one.
The selection of delegates is now conducted by the individual campaigns themselves. They are chosen for their support of the candidate, though they are actually not bound to vote for any specific candidate, so in good measure they may not be beholden or even know party officials. Notably, there are now many more delegates at the convention.
The Democrats have 4,750 delegates able to vote on the floor, nearly 3,980 selected in primaries and caucuses, and about 770 superdelegates who are elected leaders in government or established party leaders. The superdelegates cannot vote on the first ballot if no single candidate has 50 percent. Compare this to 1952, the last convention that went beyond one ballot, where only 1,230 delegates had a vote, and a good number of those would now be superdelegates. If there is a contested race, the campaign may have to woo delegates one by one.

What these changes have done is cut out the middlemen, or those with the credibility to broker a deal. The delegates are likely to have intense loyalty only to the candidate themselves. It may be the case that the losing candidates are the only individuals with the credibility to sell their own delegates on a deal. These candidates are unlikely to throw in the towel and back a competitor if they think there is any chance that they can still sneak in for the nomination. If there are hard feelings from a loser in the horse trading, charges of a corrupt bargain are certain to be made, especially by President Trump
, who still uses complaints over the fairly straightforward 2016 nomination fight to attack Democrats.
While the likelihood of a contested convention this summer remains uncertain, Democrats have good reason for it. Beyond bad publicity, it could lead to a potential fatal rupture in the party that otherwise has shown strong cohesion around the idea of ousting the president. The party leaders should start planning for how to devise such a method to choose a candidate who would not be damaged by this battle.

0,02/11/20 07:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/482615-impeachment-is-not-over-until-americans-vote-in-the-election,Impeachment is not over until Americans vote in the election,"Although the president was acquitted in his impeachment trial by Senate Republicans, the arguments made on his behalf hardly acquit him with respect to the rule of law, constitutional history, or plain common sense. As some senators described it, acquittal of impeachment charges and innocence are not necessarily congruent when it comes to judgment.
Considering the prudential factors, they understandably concluded that although abuse of power and obstruction were proven beyond question, the lack of bipartisanship in the proceeding, a looming election, along with other factors meant removing the president at this time would not serve the national interest. Others voted to acquit to save their political hides from primary challengers. Others succumbed to fallacious legal arguments. Thus, final judgment will come in November and thereafter.
In the face of widespread criticism, impeachment defense attorney Alan Dershowitz attempted to minimize what he argued during the Senate trial, claiming that he did not say “that if a president believes that his reelection was in the national interest, he can do anything.” In fact, he came rather close to saying it, and a White House counsel later argued precisely that.
Centuries of English and American legal history and the very words of the Framers make it plain that the “high crimes and misdemeanors” include abuses of office and violations of the constitutional oath to “take care” that our laws are faithfully executed. This is just what the president was charged with. Acting for personal interest rather than national interest while subverting congressional appropriations is a prime example of the autocratic conduct the Framers believed warranted removal from office.
Although it also is clear that impeachable misconduct does not need to be predicated on a criminal violation, the charges against this president are redolent of crimes. The attempt to receive a foreign emolument, in the form of material assistance for his reelection campaign, is just the sort of solicitation and receipt of bribes and gratuities that are prohibited by the United States criminal code. As a former assistant United States attorney, I once successfully prosecuted a sitting senator for such criminal charges.
Consistent with a Justice Department opinion, the president argued that he is not subject to indictment and prosecution while in office. Instead, he must be removed from office before the instruments of criminal law can be applied. That clearly implies, consistent with the understanding of the Framers, that congressional responsibility for impeachment lies outside the federal criminal law and is concerned with the kind of conduct that violates the public trust and of the oath of office taken by the president.
Even if a president avoids removal, impeachment is a stain when there is ample evidence of misconduct. Whether there will be greater future effect will depend upon emergent facts, especially potential revelations from witnesses whose testimony was blocked by the Senate majority. But even if there is no immediate change, that may not truly be the end of things.
The Watergate scandal began with a burglary in 1972, not long before an election, but producing its determinative outcome over the two years that followed mostly after the election. Besides the fact that the five burglars and two of their overseers had been certainly identified as officials of the Nixon campaign were indicted later that fall, the president claimed that he had nothing to do with their conduct. This satisfied enough of the public that, only a few weeks later, he carried 49 states and won reelection by a landslide. But then in 1973, the Watergate “plumbers” were convicted.
One of them, James McCord, later wrote a letter incriminating himself  and gained an audience with the trial judge. Thereafter, the House began an impeachment inquiry, a special prosecutor was appointed and fired, and the tapes were ordered to be disclosed by the unanimous Supreme Court, proving that the president had indeed been involved in a criminal conspiracy to obstruct the federal investigation. The House then received a bill of impeachment including a charge of abuse of power. So the lame duck president, stripped of the overwhelming public support he enjoyed only a year and a half earlier, chose to resign in disgrace that summer.

Turning to today, we do not know if there will be new revelations from present and former government officials concerning more presidential misconduct and intentions. Some of that information is the subject of pending litigation. Nor do we know the contents of various financial and tax records also before the courts. Disclosure of such facts can change public and congressional opinion even after a successful reelection.
The recent action of the Senate to acquit has sent the question to the American electorate. The answer will depend upon ever emerging facts and whether there will be constructive and principled campaigning by candidates who can appeal to thoughtful voters who hold traditional American perspectives on the economy and the role of government.

0,02/11/20 06:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/482562-why-the-time-has-finally-come-to-ratify-equal-rights-amendment,Why the time has finally come to ratify Equal Rights Amendment,"This week, the House will consider Joint Resolution 79, which removes a time limit to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. By doing so, Congress could eliminate any doubt that the Equal Rights Amendment became effective last month, when Virginia became the 38th state to ratify it.
Congress passed the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972 with bipartisan support. The momentum was contagious, with states ratifying in quick succession. Yet the opposition was well organized and vocal, capitalizing on fears about the entry of women into the labor force and a perceived threat to traditional gender roles. By the end of the 1970s, only 35 states had ratified it, three short of the requirement under the Constitution. In 1978, Congress voted to extend the time limit of seven years to 1982. However, the extension period passed without any more ratifications.
In recent years, however, the Equal Rights Amendment has reemerged, stronger than ever. The old 1970s arguments against it no longer make sense, as women have blazed a path to the highest levels of business, the military, and government service. Yet equality remains elusive, and it is constantly under threat. An overwhelming number of Americans favor an amendment to the Constitution that would guarantee equality under the law regardless of sex. Three more states have now also ratified the Equal Rights Amendment, with the shared understanding that the very process that extended the time limit out to 1982 could now remove it altogether.
The case for removing the time limit is a powerful one. The process for an amendment is set out in Article Five of the Constitution, which does not contemplate time limits at all. In fact, ratification of the 27th Amendment on salaries for Congress took over 200 years. Congress did not actually begin the practice of imposing deadlines until it proposed the Prohibition Amendment in 1917, with a deadline included as a separate clause in the amendment itself. The effectiveness of that kind of deadline has never been tested, however, one thing is clear. It would be difficult to change such a deadline once the states started to ratify the text that included it.
For the Equal Rights Amendment, however, Congress did not impose a deadline in the amendment itself. It chose to place a time limit of seven years in the joint resolution. The consequence of this choice, and by all accounts its purpose, was that Congress retained the power to change the joint resolution if the circumstances warrant. After all, one Congress cannot bind a future Congress. Further, the Supreme Court has held that Congress has broad power over the amendment process, a power that extends throughout the process of ratification. That power is so broad, in fact, that if Congress decided to remove the Equal Rights Amendment time limit today, that decision would not be subject to judicial review.
Some argue that the 1972 joint resolution expired years ago, so it can no longer be changed. This is incorrect. There is nothing in the text of the 1972 joint resolution suggesting it would ever expire. The plain text is the starting point for every effort to interpret an act of Congress. This is the true legacy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and it has transformed how Supreme Court advocates write briefs and how justices write opinions. According to the plain text of the 1972 joint resolution, the time limit is a limit on ratification, not a sunset provision on the joint resolution itself. Congress knows how to pass a sunset provision when it wants to, like it had done in the Violence Against Women Act. It did not do that here.

No matter what happens in Congress, there is still a path forward for the Equal Rights Amendment. A court could hold that the time limit is simply ineffective. The validity of an amendment depends on Article Five, which says an amendment “shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states.” Congress cannot change that process just by passing a resolution. The recent lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of Illinois, Nevada, and Virginia will address this issue, unless Congress acts first.
In the history of our Constitution, a time limit in Congress has never stood in the way of an amendment that has been ratified by three fourths of the states. Congress should act now to resolve the issue and make clear that the Equal Rights Amendment is valid and guarantees equality under the law for all regardless of sex. There should be no time limit on equality.

Inertia, like love, makes the world go round, and keeps it going around. Bodies in motion tend to stay in motion. Economies that are growing tend to continue growing. So turning to the January employment situation report reminds us that the economy has inertia on its side. It has a reasonable head of steam. Growth is not the wow factor. The economy is growing at about 2 percent a year, which is pretty pedestrian by historical standards. Instead it is about the potential of the economy. The reason why potential growth is low today relates to the reason why recent jobs reports have been raising some eyebrows.
When an economy is growing, economists always look for the irresistible object, for whatever it is that will stop the forward motion of the economy, and make an economy that is newly at rest tend to stay at rest. This is not because economists love misery. It is only because the emergence of an obstacle to a growing economy gives us our next job to try to perpetuate growth or, if that obstacle in fact stalls the economy, to restore growth.
The economy has been creating a lot of jobs month after month, which is surprising because the working age population has been growing very slowly. Americans are greying, Baby Boomers are retiring, and there are proportionately fewer teens and young millennials to take their places in the labor force. As the number of jobs grows at an impressive pace month after month, economists are scratching their heads and wondering, where are all of these people coming from? In looking for roadblock that could stop the jobs bandwagon, and potentially the economic expansion, when will those critical people stop showing up in the monthly jobs report?
The January jobs report provides the answer, at least for one more month, which is not just yet. The economy added 225,000 more nonfarm payroll jobs. Expansion continues, even though the labor force participation rate is barely changed, and the trend dictates that the ceiling on labor force growth is close overhead. Worrywart economists looking might see a few small clouds on the otherwise bright horizon. Manufacturing employment continues to look flat, despite all the efforts to expand exports and add good blue collar jobs. Long term unemployment did not decrease much.
But in the broader landscape, the picture is good. People continue to find jobs. People with jobs tend to be happy and spend their wages, which in turn creates more jobs for the next month. Once again, bodies in motion tend to stay in motion. So economists looking at this jobs report do not see specific brush fires to fight, but rather continue to worry about dry future conditions. The working age population keeps growing slowly, while the headroom for growth in our labor force continues to shrink.

Preparing not for the next monthly jobs report, but rather for the coming years and decades ahead, which is what we should actually care about, requires that we try to speed up the paltry growth in the labor force so that we can grow production faster and provide all of those retiring Baby Boomers with the living standards that they expect, with enough left over so that our working age population, and their children in turn, have the kind of living standards and financing of the education that they need.
To that end, we need to encourage more adult Americans to join or to stay in the labor force, to upgrade their skills so they can be more productive and earn higher wages, and to attract the most talent from all around the world. Every forward thinking enterprise in every country is looking for the best people from anywhere around the world to fill cutting edge jobs, so that those businesses can seize economic leadership. If the United States wants to keep the lead, we need to compete aggressively. If we do not, the problem sniffing economists will for sure someday see trouble in the jobs reports month after month. Economies at rest tend to stay at rest.

First, they are trying to bully you into supporting their political goals. Second, they are grossly distorting history to fit their own preconceived notions.
However, when President Trump
had declared during his third State of the Union that our nation “was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth,” there is no doubt that he is more concerned about who Americans are than who we are not. Again and again throughout his candidacy, and even more throughout his presidency, Democrats have alleged that his policies, statements, or actions are “not who we are.”
They act as though enforcing the law or pursuing popular policies that had indeed been viewed as uncontroversial and bipartisan as recently as the Clinton administration, somehow violates fundamental characteristics of Americans. The “not who we are” crowd is usually short on details to back up their claims, relying instead on platitudes and quotations from famous liberals, such as “yes we can” from the presidential campaign of Barack Obama
, “we are a nation of immigrants” from the book written by John Kennedy, and “give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses” from that iconic poem affixed to the base of the Statue of Liberty.

After three years of policies delivering win after win for the people, the president firmly pushed back against those who seek to redefine what it means to be an American and reminded us who we really are. He has not forgotten the inherent truth about our heritage. He said, “Our ancestors braved the unknown, tamed the wilderness, settled the Wild West, lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger” and  “vanquished tyranny and fascism, ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine, laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers.”
He continued, “This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance. We are Americans. We are pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the new world, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of almighty God.” That is who we are, and no extent of revisionist history or political exploitation of tragedy from the past will make us forget it.

President Trump did not call back to our shared story “from the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King” to tell you why you should oppose the Democratic Party platform. He made that case eloquently elsewhere in his address, and he did not need to specify that socialism is “not who we are” to demonstrate that it is a terrible idea.
He did it because he knows our conception of who we are as Americans is more important and enduring than who we elect as president. If we allow politicians or activists to make our children forget that important legacy, or to substitute their own contrived vision of history, we risk losing what makes our nation great. I am tired of hearing that his agenda is “not who we are.” He has made it perfectly clear he knows exactly who we are.

has finished the best week of his presidency. In the span of three days, he reveled in the botched Iowa caucuses, delivered a made for television State of the Union address that excited his base and infuriated Democrats, and was expeditiously acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial. To cap this all off, his approval rating hit a record high of 49 percent, according to Gallup. His approval rating among independents also ticked up to 42 percent, tying three previous polls as his best among that group. 
Trump was not the only one to experience a polling surge. Gallup found that 51 percent of Americans now view the Republican Party favorably, up from 43 percent months ago and above 50 percent for the first time since 2005, marking a major win for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Simply put, Trump is now in a better position to win reelection than ever before, while the future of the Democratic Party is marred by uncertainty.
Indeed, the Iowa caucuses last week were expected to provide clarity and substance to a Democratic primary race that so far has been defined by hypothetical analysis and rapidly changing poll numbers. All throughout the previous month, the top candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Senator Bernie Sanders, all polled in first place in Iowa at some point, according to the Real Clear Politics averages.
With 100 percent of the vote now in, it seems that Buttigieg has won the state of Iowa, although Sanders came in an extraordinarily close second. It is also entirely possible for these results to change, as the Associated Press has been unable to declare a winner because of irregularities, and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has also asked to recanvass the vote, but it is still unclear what the eventual result will be.
In all likelihood, Buttigieg and Sanders will end up splitting a majority of the delegates in Iowa, allowing both candidates to declare victory while leaving the primary race with even less clarity than before. There is now no clear frontrunner. While the disorder in Iowa is very disappointing for the Democratic Party, it is even more discouraging in light of the fact that Trump is now emboldened by a strong economy, soaring fundraising, his acquittal in the Senate, and record high job approval among Americans.
Biden, who leads in most national polls and thought to be the candidate most likely to beat Trump, finished in a distant and disappointing fourth place in Iowa. In a campaign that already lacks not just enthusiasm but also money, this poses a significant problem for his candidacy. Given his cratering in Iowa, it has become clear to many that Michael Bloomberg
, who did not compete in Iowa nor in any of the other early states, may be the only candidate who can successfully take on Trump and defeat him.
To be clear, I am currently working for the Bloomberg campaign. I have worked with the former New York City mayor for more than two decades. Objectively, however, it has now become clear that Bloomberg is the only Democrat who could successfully take on Trump. As the former leader of the largest city in the nation and one of the great capitalists of our time, Bloomberg is the only viable candidate in the race who can go toe to toe with Trump on the economy, which is the strongest issue for Republicans, and make a compelling argument that resonates with many swing voters.
Furthermore, Bloomberg is also arguably the only Democratic candidate to emerge from the first primary contest in a relatively stronger position. While the rest of the candidates were caught up with the Iowa debacle, Bloomberg spent the week talking to voters in Super Tuesday states like California and Virginia, as well as general election swing states such as Pennsylvania, running a campaign focused on his record and leadership, but also a campaign that has now gotten under the skin of the president.

A Morning Consult poll revealed Bloomberg leading all the Democratic candidates in a hypothetical matchup against Trump, as 47 percent of respondents said they would vote for Bloomberg, 40 percent said they would choose Trump, and 13 percent undecided. While Bloomberg has also been making steady primary polling gains, likely among voters who seek a steady hand and are put off by the disarray, and is arguably the candidate in the best position to defeat Trump, it is now clear that the Democratic Party has finished its worst week since the 2016 election.
Trump, on the other hand, decisively had his best week. He is in a better position to win reelection than ever before, unless the Democratic Party can find a way to unite behind a candidate who can actually defeat him.

The big recent development has not been shifting leads in Iowa, a state quite unrepresentative of the general electorate. Rather, it has been the rise of Michael Bloomberg
. Nationally, he is now polling ahead of Pete Buttigieg. There is a good reason for this. None of the “leading candidates” can actually give Democrats what they want most, which is a decisive victory against Donald Trump
this fall.
Most Democratic voters are in no mood to take risks. Many do believe the president to be an existential threat to the nation and even the world. The task at hand is to pick the candidate best positioned to win. We can argue about policy after the election. The winning ticket is Michael Bloomberg and Kamala Harris
. This is not a judgment about who would be the best president. It is only about who is best positioned to prevail in the election. I reached this conclusion by a process of elimination, focusing on which candidate can best withstand what will be an awful general campaign.
First, Democrats should hesitate to lead with any candidate who voted to impeach. That does not mean that the candidates in the Senate should have voted to vote for acquittal. But politics has dealt them a harsh hand. Impeachment will be the issue around which Trump solidifies his base. It may have the same sort of appeal that “getting Brexit done” had to swing voters in Britain. The Democrats took a gamble, and it may not play well for them. It is best to defuse by picking someone not directly involved.
Second, we have no strong reason to think the candidates on the left, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, can win. The British Labour Party could not win with its leader Jeremy Corbyn, and America is even more conservative than Britain. Democrats worry about the policy differences among candidates too much. Even if a Democrat wins, things will have to be negotiated with far less progressive constituencies. The actual space for progressive change is likely to be too minimal to risk the race on it.
Third, Joe Biden is too risky. One certainly has to worry not just about his senior moments but also about the relentless attacks on him and his son Hunter Biden for their involvement and business in Ukraine. That is not fair, but politics is not about fair. We do not get to set the limits on the claims of our opponents, even if they are false and morally offensive.
Fourth, Buttigieg remains untested. We do not know whether the country is prepared to vote for a gay president. I hope that it is, but this is not the time to test the proposition, especially with a candidate who is the mayor of a small city and has barely passed the age limit. Buttigieg has a long future among Democrats, but this election is just not the next step in it.
That eliminates the front runners. Bloomberg is much stronger than the rest of the pack. He has the right platforms on gun control and climate change for a campaign in which suburban women voters will be critical. Universal health care may be suicidal in the general election. It is unlikely to get through the Senate in any case. He also has the wealth to campaign without limits. He is a real New York billionaire against a pretender, and I suspect that some voters may get a certain thrill out of that match up.
Bloomberg has the name recognition and the network. Not for nothing has he been supporting progressive causes around the nation for many years. Of course, he is older than he should be. He is also from New York instead of the Midwest. He is also a white Jewish male. He is not a great candidate. But he is the best positioned to win against those running.

The candidate should be chosen to win the necessary votes in the swing states. The running mate should be chosen to respond to the traditional constituencies of the party. The ticket must acknowledge the importance of women and minorities. The likely choice then will be Kamala Harris or Stacey Abrams. A campaign that criticizes either of them will no doubt be seen as racist and sexist. Harris has one very big advantage in blunting those attacks in that she already occupies national office as a senator.
The vice president may have to become president, especially when the candidate is older. Harris can do that in the eyes of the nation. Much like Buttigieg, Abrams represents the future, but primary voters in this cycle should stay clear of any unnecessary risks. Bloomberg and Harris is the winning ticket. Unfortunately, I have more confidence that it would win the general election than I have that it would win the party nomination.

If this is the case, it means they thought that there were some executive actions that would be deemed as high crimes and misdemeanors. One of the key questions the Senate faces in the impeachment trial of President Trump
is whether his conduct with Ukraine qualifies as an impeachable offense. The answer is that it does, and the point should not be in serious doubt.
The lawyers for Trump have claimed that Ukraine was only business as usual, for this or any other president. Writing in the New York Times, Josh Blackman agrees, arguing that the House of Representatives impeached the president simply for being a politician and, as the lawyers for Trump argued, for considering the effect of his conduct “on the next election.” The president, Blackman maintains, cannot be impeached for pursuing “legal policies that members of the opposition party deem insufficiently publicly spirited.” This view of impeachment is wrong for three reasons.
First, as Philip Bobbitt explains, the problem is not just that Trump asked a favor from Ukraine that may have been helpful to his reelection, but what he did “to get that favor” by clearly refusing to “disburse congressionally authorized military assistance is a violation of the law that strikes at the heart of constitutional government.” The conduct of the president is an impeachable offense because he sought to obtain an electoral advantage by ignoring statutory requirements set by Congress in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Such action indeed represents an abuse of power.
Second, history provides no support for the perspective that Trump was acting as politicians will. Blackman equates requesting that the Ukrainians investigate potential rival corruption with President Lincoln encouraging General William Sherman to permit deployed soldiers to return to Indiana to vote in 1864, so that the state would remain under Republican control. That result would have inured to the political benefit of Republicans and to Lincoln himself by ensuring support from Indiana for the war efforts.
Blackmun also cites President Johnson appointing Ramsey Clark to be attorney general, knowing that the perceived conflict of interest for his father, Associate Justice Thomas Clark, might push him to resign from the Supreme Court. The resignation would then create an opportunity for the nomination of Thurgood Marshall as the first African American justice in the nation, a move that could have helped both Johnson and his party.
If, as Blackmun reasons, the actions of both Lincoln and Johnson did not amount to impeachable offenses, then there is no reason why the actions of Trump should. So while the motives of a president alone may not be enough to distinguish unconstitutional abuses of power from legitimate presidential actions, there are some very important differences between Lincoln and Johnson, on the one hand, and Trump, on the other hand.
One is that, because the moves by Lincoln and Johnson were not covert, there could be little doubt as to their origins. Compare this to the effort by Trump to secure a favor from Ukraine through a private emissary, his own personal attorney, operating outside of the normal diplomatic track and in tension with stated national security policy goals. In the end, both Lincoln and Johnson would own their actions in a way that Trump had pointedly sought to avoid. Moreover, neither Lincoln nor Johnson acted illegally.
Another difference is that they did not deliberately implicate a foreign power in domestic matters. One of the real and understated dangers of the attempt by Trump to obtain Ukrainian assistance in his reelection bid is that, had the effort never come to light, the Ukrainians would have had in possession potentially compromising information about the president. Such damaging information could have been used by the Ukrainians as leverage against the president, again covertly, and therefore beyond the ability of the American people to consider in the next general election.

Finally, the argument that Trump simply acted as a politician proves too much. If nearly every policy decision that a president makes has some kind of political implication, which is indeed probably accurate, it is unclear that any action by the president could ever be defined as an abuse of power sufficient to qualify as a high crime or misdemeanor.
Some people view impeachment as “an emergency measure to save the republic in free fall,” as Blackmun claims. But perhaps the Framers did not intend impeachment to sit on the shelf, like a precious umbrella awaiting a rainstorm bad enough to justify its use. Perhaps they understood that the presidency might be assumed by someone unmoored from the traditional limitations that have deterred other Oval Office occupants from illegally scheming to advantage themselves at the expense of the public interest. Perhaps that day has arrived. The Constitution does not say otherwise.

0,01/22/20 06:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/479423-a-new-era-in-russia-will-allow-america-to-rethink-its-policy,A new era in Russia will allow America to rethink its policy,"The announcement by President Vladimir Putin
of changes to the Russian constitution in his state of the nation address this month, followed by the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, suggests that Russia has entered a new political era. With the country likely entering a transition period during which it could become more inwardly focused, the next American administration will then have the opportunity to develop a less personalized approach to Russia, one based on a sober assessment that the challenges posed by Russia are genuine and extend beyond Putin.
Indeed, the changes provide the strongest indication yet that Putin will not remain president beyond the end of his current term in 2024. For two decades, he has been the linchpin of the Russian political system. In part thanks to crafted branding by the Kremlin, Putin has become one of the most recognizable leaders across the world, praised by some as a pillar of “traditional values” and then vilified by others as the evil genius behind the war in Ukraine, attempts to subvert Western democracy, and other sins. President Obama famously described the Russian leader as acting like a “bored kid in the back of the classroom,” while President Trump
has suggested his personal chemistry with Putin will cut through the range of disagreements poisoning relations between Washington and Moscow.
In fact, Russian foreign policy rests on a deep seated consensus that the country must remain a fully sovereign great power, a peer to the United States, and a regional hegemon in Eurasia. Even if Putin has steered it in a more confrontational direction since the protests of 2011, for which he blamed the United States and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the underlying aims and tools of Russian foreign policy do remain relatively constant. The Washington fixation on Putin has made a sober assessment of relations between the United States and Russia much more difficult.
It now seems clear that the era of “High Putinism” is ending. While Putin has ruled out changing the constitution to allow one person to serve more than two terms as president, he will almost certainly remain the principal power broker within the Russian political system. The institutional setup remains to be seen. Putin could once again become prime minister under a new president whose loyalty he trusts. He could also remain the head of the State Council, a consultative body comprising regional governors and vice governors which Putin has proposed giving “constitutional status.”
These maneuvers are similar to how aging autocrats in China, Singapore, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere have sought to ensure a stable transition. They suggest less that Putin is seeking to retain power forever and more, as he suggested over the weekend, that “it would be very worrying to return to the situation we had in the 1980s when state leaders stayed in power” without “ensuring the necessary conditions for a transition of power.”
Russia does seem to be entering a transition period, one in which it has little incentive to exacerbate an already poisonous relationship with the United States. Putin barely touched on foreign policy and was devoid of the grievances toward the West that characterized many past addresses. Apart from constitutional change, most of the emphasis was on domestic issues such as improving education, child care, and other socioeconomic issues that have fueled recent protests. Other signals also suggest that the Kremlin recognizes the danger of pushing its confrontation with the West too far. While Russia will no doubt continue low cost interventions in places such as Libya, it seems unlikely to provoke a major crisis in Europe.

For the United States, that reality implies adopting a posture of cautious waiting. Partisanship, impeachment, and the election this year have made it impossible for Washington to do much right now anyway. For too long, however, American policy has been on autopilot. While Russian political interference, military saber rattling, and the wars in Ukraine and Syria are the immediate causes of the crisis today, a reluctance dating to the 1990s to view the Russian objectives as legitimate or give Moscow a stake in the security architecture in the era after the Cold War provide the backdrop.
Indeed, the result of all this has been an escalating confrontation between the United States and Russia, the breakdown of communication channels set up to mitigate crises, and an ever closer partnership between Russia and China directed at rolling back American influence. But while Russia sorts out its own future over the coming years, the United States has a great opportunity to develop a new approach, one that is not fixated on the caricature of a malevolent Putin as the source of all our problems.

Its next president will have a lot less to do. In his address to the nation this month, Vladimir Putin
proposed the most sweeping changes with the Russian constitution in almost three decades. Under the new system, which could go into full effect as early as this year, future Russian presidents will be limited to a total of two terms. Moreover, significant powers would revert to the parliament. The Russian president will focus on security and foreign affairs. It will be a shadow of the office Putin now holds, indicating that whatever problems Russia will face, the prospect of Putin declaring himself president for life is not one of them.
The government, including Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, has dutifully resigned to make way for the changes. If the new system goes into effect as planned, the next prime minister and government will be selected by the parliament directly. The State Council, a little known office comprised of governors and other high officials, will play a more prominent role in ruling the nation. Medvedev has moved into a newly created deputy role in the Security Council of Russia, which is chaired by Putin. So while the offices may have changed, the deciders are still in power for the moment. Putin is not so much clearing the decks as he is rearranging the furniture.
The new system will also restrict foreign influences on how Russia is run. The clearest example is the final declaration of a trend that has been in the works for some time. The Russian constitution will take precedence over international agreements. The Russian government will be free to ignore the international judgments it disagrees with, whether from the European Court of Human Rights or many other inconvenient lawsuits.
Putin also proposes that the post of president be limited to individuals who have resided in Russia for at least 25 years, and that senior official posts, including judges, ministers, governors, and parliament members, be forbidden to Russians holding dual citizenship or foreign residency permits. Clearly, the new system is reserved for loyal citizens who stay in Russia, not political opponents returning from abroad, or even business elites with a potential escape route and a foreign bank account in hand.
The past year has proven to be among the most difficult for Putin, and for the social and political legitimacy of the system that he built over his last two decades in power. The spectacle of protests in Moscow, along with the harsh crackdown, went viral at home and abroad. The opposition also schemed an innovative strategy to embarrass United Russia by steering the opposition vote to the second ranked challenger no matter the party.
The nuclear accident in the far north region, which was likely the result of a weapons test, evoked the memory of Chernobyl, just as the miniseries on it was one of the top viewed foreign films. The stagnant standard of living in Russia continues to be a drag on the ability of Putin to run the country under his system, just as the country tires of the system itself.

Putin, therefore, had to solve numerous problems with his reorganization. The eroding public opinion has only brought into sharper relief two fast approaching milestones, which are parliament elections in 2021 and the end of his term in 2024. The proposed reforms, with the appearance of greater checks and balances and, perhaps more importantly, his promise to leave as president in four years, are proving popular for the moment.
Yet all of the shifting duties among state organs that Putin proposes is a feature, not a bug, of the new system. It provides him with both the time and opportunity to land in a senior government post from which he can continue to guide, if no longer dictate, the course of the system that he built. The new system is less for establishing checks and balances than establishing a framework for consensus, where the ultimate authority could have little to do with an organizational chart in the constitution.

While the House resolution is designed to trigger the authority of the decades old War Powers Act, the executive branch will certainly ignore it, while the Senate resolution will certainly be killed by a presidential veto. This is all kabuki theatre. On war powers, the Constitution is now a dead letter, and the United States is no longer a republic but an imperial power.
This sad reality could not have been made more clear when the defense secretary scolded lawmakers for considering a debate on war powers. The Constitution is simply an annoyance to members of the military industrial complex. Archaic documents, we are implicitly told, should not dictate critical national security policy that calls for decisive action and dispatch. The problem is not that the Constitution is vague about war powers. The problem is that the executive branch actively chooses to ignore it because it is inconvenient, while Congress acquiesces because lawmakers want no part of the very tricky business of war or in accepting blame for mistakes.
The Framers were clear in their intent to grant the power to initiate war with the legislative branch. The power to start a war cannot be given to the president, James Madison said, because “the trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man,” and “war is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement.” As commander in chief, the president may legally act without Congress to defend against an attack on the United States, but mounting offensive operations requires legislative approval.
Even in cases of limited war, the Constitution contains the little known marque and reprisal clause that requires limited military actions taken by the government or private citizens to be approved by Congress. Thomas Jefferson explained that even lower level hostilities must have legislative approval because “the making of a reprisal is a very serious thing” that is “considered an act of war and never failed to produce it in the case of a nation able to make war.” Because of the potential consequences of killing a military leader of an adversary nation, even limited acts of war require legislative sanction because they very well could become bigger wars.
For the military industrial complex, including its branch in Congress, these requirements are inconvenient. So what? The Constitution is designed to increase inefficiency for the sake of liberty. No one wants to give a known criminal an expensive laborious trial and extend a variety of due process protections, but this is what is necessary in our freedom loving republic.
The intent of the Framers on war powers places many Republicans in an odd position. Many are originalists when it comes to abortion, the Second Amendment, the death penalty, and a host of other issues. When it comes to war powers, however, they see “penumbras” and other “emanations” that refract thel intent of the Framers. After all, they say, the world has changed, and war can come in an instant. Regarding war powers, many conservatives see the Constitution the way progressives do as obsolete.

Democrats are no better. The House resolution seems motivated not by a genuine desire to reclaim the war powers, but by the political obsession with doing the opposite of what the president wants. If he declared the Big Mac the official hamburger of the country, Democrats would rush to the House Rules Committee with a resolution supporting the Whopper instead. We are living in serious times, but these are not serious people. The House could have reasserted itself by repealing or rewriting the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force. This would have signaled that lawmakers take their responsibility in the Constitution seriously, but still they have done nothing, and they will continue to do nothing on this.
The problem is not a lack of clarity in on war and peace. The problem is the Framers assumed that we would have, as Madison said, “temperate leaders” who would not allow the “tyranny of their own passions” to drive foreign policy. When American leaders do not wish to exercise their own granted authority, then the Constitution is simply a piece of parchment.

0,01/13/20 08:30 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/477923-a-gop-led-edge-red-states-see-less-unemployment-more-economic-growth,"A GOP-led edge: Red states see less unemployment, more economic growth","Opinion polling isn’t everything. However, it often gives you a good barometer of the general shape of things, especially at the state level. As of mid-2019, every single one of the top 10 most popular governors in the country were Republicans, while eight of the 10 least popular were Democrats. Generally speaking, voters trust Republicans more than they trust Democrats to lead their states.
A deeper look at GOP-led states’ economic success explains why — but beyond the minutiae of simple policy, the bottom line is that electing a Republican often means increased growth and lower unemployment. An even stronger rule bears out the opposite when Democrats control the governor’s mansion.
Indeed, some correlations will always transcend state politics. But what becomes clear is that there is a strong statistical case that electing a Republican governor — even without a matching GOP statehouse — plays a significant role in states’ economic success. Look no further than the last election cycle paired with economic statistics, and this trend soon becomes clear.
State unemployment rates and GDP growth must be viewed relative to national averages. The average U.S. unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in 2018 and 3.7 percent in 2019. Strong employment growth at the state level is directly correlated with governorship. Among the 20 states with the lowest unemployment rates (three are tied for 20th, so there are 23 states ranking here), 17 had Republican governors prior to 2018. North Dakota, which has a 2.5 percent unemployment rate, prospers in large part because of its Republican leadership’s decision to embrace new hydraulic fracturing technology. As a result, nearly a third of job openings in the state remain unfilled longer than three months. And it’s not only high-skilled workers who benefit from strong job growth; fast-food workers in North Dakota earn multiples of the $7.25 federal minimum hourly wage, fetching as much as $20 per hour.
Among states whose unemployment rates increased the most last year, Democrats were most likely in charge. In states whose unemployment rates increased more than statistical noise (more than one-tenth of a percent), five of the eight have Democratic governors. Furthermore, among the eight states that saw the sharpest decrease in unemployment (0.5 percent or more) — Alabama, Colorado, Maine, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia — five have Republican governors. And only New Jersey had a Democrat in charge before 2018.
Meanwhile, U.S. GDP increased by 2.2 percent in 2017 and by 2.9 percent in 2018. During the first three quarters of 2019, the average was 2.4 percent. When ranking GDP growth by state, the correlation between economic success and Republican governors becomes even more clear. Among the top 10 growing states in the second quarter of 2019 (the most recent detailed numbers available), only two of the 10 had Democratic governors prior to the 2018 election cycle. Among the four states that had growth above 4 percent, Texas (leading with 4.7 percent), New Mexico and Wyoming had GOP executives; Alaska was run by an independent. In fact, these states’ growth represent almost 10 percent of all economic growth in the nation during this period.
In the 10 states with the slowest GDP growth, Democrats have more to celebrate: The same figures show that eight of the 10 worst-performing states in Q2 2019 had GOP governors in the prior election cycle.
Sounds like a good case for a split ballot. However, six of those slowest-growing states (Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine and New Jersey) have since elected Democrats to the statehouse. Since Kentucky’s election occurred in November 2019, we can’t factor that in. However, among the other states, GDP growth collapsed in 2019 after electing Democratic governors. In 2018 these states grew on average by 2.24 percent. In Q2 2019 it was a measly 0.92 percent annualized rate — a drop of 59 percent! Michigan’s growth rate fell from 2.7 percent to 1.1 percent, Illinois’ from 2.1 percent to 1.1 percent, Wisconsin’s from 2.5 percent to 1.1 percent, and Maine’s from 1.9 percent to an embarrassing 0.6 percent. In New Jersey (whose election was in 2017), it’s been cut by two-thirds, from 2.0 percent to an anemic 0.7 percent.
So, electing a Republican governor seems to give your state a fair but imperfect shot at growth.
What about states that added a GOP governor last cycle? There’s only one case in point here: Alaska’s governor’s mansion went from independent to red in 2018 — and growth followed. The state’s economy changed from a -0.3 percent contraction in 2018 to the third highest in the nation, at 4.1 percent in Q2 2019.

Numbers only tell a part of the story. The total sum of opportunity costs borne by high-tax states with Democratic governors and legislatures include incalculable damage to the working and middle classes. The states’ economic health (or lack thereof) further accelerates the magnet for millions of families fleeing taxation and regulation in blue states for better economic prospects in red states.
In 2020, 11 governors’ seats are up for grabs — and considering that seven of these are currently Republican, the residents of these states should heed the stark lessons of catching the blue wave in 2018.

0,12/26/19 10:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/475941-americans-want-civility-in-politics,Americans want civility in politics,"Watching the hyperpartisan impeachment unfold in Congress, it is no wonder public faith in government is reaching historic lows. The petty rancor on the House floor and the never ending slew of vicious tweets by President Trump are a sign that civility today is on life support. In fact, the demise of civility is one of the very few things that almost everyone seems to agree on. The latest annual survey released by Weber Shandwick finds that nearly 70 percent of Americans feel we have a serious problem with civility. Yet despite these gloomy indicators, there are plenty of reasons to believe that comity is not dead and trust in government can be restored.
It helps to take the long view. The Founding Fathers saw that conflict and division inevitably lay at the heart of our democracy, and they set out to balance a range of inherent tensions in the drafting of the Constitution, including the rural versus urban, states versus federal, legislative versus judicial. The Founding Fathers believed that conflicts would ultimately be resolved by the people, and their faith in us has been rewarded so many times in the more than two centuries since the Constitution was ratified.
Rising above our political differences has never been easy. However, even in the highly polarized climate today, we are reminded that transcending our political divisions is possible. Consider the improbable friendship of George Bush and Michelle Obama. The political viewpoints of the former president and the former first lady in various ways could not be further apart. Yet the two have forged a warm relationship throughout the years. “We disagree on policy but we do not disagree on humanity. We do not disagree about love and compassion,” Obama said of their friendship.
This very sentiment of shared values resonates with a significant portion of the Americans. For all the anger and divisiveness that is laid bare on social media and on cable networks hour after hour and day after day, there is a yearning for civility across our political discourse. In the Weber Shandwick survey, about half of the respondents said they will choose to ignore people in their lives who are acting uncivilly or they will choose to remove themselves from those situations. This reveals a genuine appetite to create experiences for respectful and authentic political discussion.
When given the right opportunities, Americans will hash out their political differences in respectful and productive ways. Over the last seven years, the National Institute for Civil Discourse has held training sessions and forums, interacting with some 60,000 people from all backgrounds on a range of crucial issues, from immigration to climate change, to create understanding across differences and to bring about positive solutions.

These efforts suggest that for all the despair and alienation that has been induced by decades of hyperpartisanship and exacerbated by the Trump era, there is a way forward. It begins with individuals embracing civility by making a choice to engage with those with whom they do not agree and not defaulting to reflexive distrust. If you do not believe this is possible, take a look at this documentary series that demonstrates what happens when a group of divided people around the country come together to better understand one another and to bridge their political differences.
Naysayers will claim our current political discourse is irreparably broken and the unfolding impeachment with its mostly party line votes proves that reaching across the aisle can no longer happen. But this negative perspective, which is endlessly stoked on social media, fails to take into account another reality. Americans are as hungry as ever to connect and engage. That hunger, along with a shared sense of civic responsibility, has sustained the republic for more than two centuries. In this holiday season when we pause to reflect and consider, it is time for all of us to step up and once again demonstrate that the people are better than our politics.

In what many had expected to be another forgettable debate, Pete Buttigieg
rose to the occasion and took advantage of his frontrunner treatment. He not only managed to defend himself against attacks, but also landed the type of blows that have evaded his run. Make no mistake, the seven candidates did a fine job, but only one was able to successfully separate himself from the other Democrats on stage and bring new voters to his fray. That candidate happened to be Buttigieg.
For all the hand wringing and consternation from many Democrats on whether the South Bend mayor was prepared for the bright lights, his performance in the latest debate could perhaps silence even his most ardent critics. Buttigieg did not simply defend his record from attacks by Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, he responded in an authentic tone that has evaded his past debate performances and has been the missing ingredient in a campaign that sorely needed a breakout moment. As he did earlier this year, Buttigieg has exceeded expectations and seems like the type of change candidate that Democrats have been searching for.
While far from perfect, he looked like a leader on a stage that included a former vice president and several senators. Some thought this feat, given his age and the optics, might be impossible for a candidate who has only held local office. But all those concerns were put to bed after his debate performance. While a lot of work must be done to tighten his message and take his campaign to the next level, it is undeniable that the mayor from a relatively small town in Indiana, with little national exposure this time last year, came across as the steady hand that is needed to defeat President Trump
in what will most certainly be an ugly general election.
Buttgieg was not the only candidate to boost his profile. The way Andrew Yang reacted to a question regarding lack of diversity on the debate stage symbolized the authentic response that his campaign has now become synonymous with. Pundits such as myself, who have dismissed Yang as a single issue candidate lacking the top level of gravitas required for the presidency, are now forced to view him as the underdog who actually outlasted many competitors and earned the right to be taken seriously.

Democrats should take solace in the performance of the entire field of candidates in the latest debate. Every single one of them on the stage in Los Angeles would not only be a better president than Donald Trump but would restore decency to an office that has suffered over the last three years. The question for Democratic voters at this point in the campaign is which candidate is best positioned to take on the president in the general election next year. That kind of candidate still appears to be Joe Biden
.
Questions about his ability to carry out strong debate performances have plagued his campaign for months, but voters might decide his gaffes are baked into his persona and not a disqualifying factor. Biden has defied all odds and continues to lead the pack in most national and state polls. With the Iowa caucuses approaching, time may be on his side. While Buttigieg did well, no candidate has had a sustained boost as a result of a strong debate performance. If any campaign is going to catch the former vice president, they must do it soon. There will not be many more chances.

is now defined by impeachment, and she does not seem terribly thrilled about it. When she finally announced her decision to begin drafting articles of impeachment, she was visibly on edge, launching into a rant at the podium and snapping at a reporter who questioned the partisan nature of her crusade against President Trump
. Her lack of poise and uneasiness showed how tenuous her position is.
Let us be clear. Democrats fully own this impeachment charade and will be held responsible by the American people in the weeks and years to come. For months, Pelosi had appeared reticent to launch impeachment proceedings. She held off the more progressive members of her caucus, making speeches about areas of common ground Democrats shared with the White House, and declaring that she would not pursue impeachment unless there was clearly “overwhelming and bipartisan” support for it.
However, Pelosi is instead pursuing a deeply partisan effort to remove the president from office. As she no doubt expected, progressive Democrats on the left are delighted, but ordinary voters are not buying the case for impeachment. This is not the first time she has made a decision that may cost her the House majority. During her first tenure as speaker, she chose to ram ObamaCare through the House of Representatives without any Republican backing in 2009, arrogantly stating that Congress must pass the legislation before the American people could find out what was in it.
That led to a shellacking for Democrats in the 2010 midterms, ending her first stint as speaker. Pelosi knows her decision to force the impeachment issue carries similar political risks. She herself used to openly tell voters and her members that impeachment was political poison for Democrats. “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there is something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan I do not think we should go down that path because it divides the country,” she said this spring.

Trump won't say if he disagrees with Birx that virus is widespread
Yet here we are months into an impeachment inquiry more fitting for the theater than the halls of Congress. Not only will the impeachment circus harm Democrats in the 2020 general election, it will define the political legacy of Pelosi. When history reflects on her storied career in Congress, this will signify the defining moment. Pelosi will forever be remembered as the House speaker who pushed through bogus impeachment charges in a biased manner that was designed to rig the process in favor of her party.
Deep down, Pelosi probably knows that a different path was open to her, but she opted for the more divisive course of action by moving forward with impeachment. She has gone too far to turn back now, and it is clear that she is none too happy with the position she has boxed herself into. History will likely not judge her decision on this monumental act kindly.

0,12/06/19 06:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/473446-the-latest-election-takeover-attempt,The latest election takeover attempt,"Would you like to have Washington take over all state and local elections and stop the reforms intended to improve the integrity and security of the voting process? If you say yes, then you might be in luck. This week, the House of Representatives has taken up the Voting Rights Advancement Act, though the bill would be more accurately named the Election Fraud Advancement Act or even the Federal Takeover of Local Elections Act.
The bill seeks to overturn the Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County versus Eric Holder. That ruling back in 2013 threw out the provisions of sections four and five of the Voting Rights Act, which required a small number of states with old histories of discriminating against minorities to get federal approval of any proposed changes to their election laws. The requirements covered everything from drawing new district boundaries to putting in place fraud prevention measures such as voter identification.
As a purely legal matter, these sections represented an unprecedented intrusion into state sovereignty. The Supreme Court ruled in the Shelby County decision that, while such an extraordinary requirement may have been necessary in 1965, it could no longer be justified. After nearly a half century, the civil rights picture had vastly improved in the covered states, so there was no longer any justification for making them get the blessing from the Justice Department before administering their own elections.
Progressives acted as if this ruling would usher in a new Jim Crow era. Since then, they have pushed the false narrative that an epidemic of voter suppression has erupted, a myth completely exploded by the increased voter turnout recorded in many subsequent elections. What the left has conveniently failed to mention is that the Shelby County decision did not affect section two of the Voting Rights Act, which remains the permanent nationwide provision that bars racial discrimination in the voting context. That section continues to protect all voters from any real suppression.
Progressives just do not like the fact that they now have to actually go to court and prove that a state is engaging in discrimination to enjoin a new election law. They liked the old system where a partisan attorney general like Eric Holder could be counted on to object to election reforms they did not like or redistricting plans that did not help Democrats. South Carolina had to go to federal court in 2012 to overturn the meritless objection to its new voter identification law. South Carolina was successful but only after spending millions of dollars to litigate against the Justice Department.
Not only would the bill bring back the approval process for those states freed by the 2013 decision, as well as other states never covered before, it would empower the Justice Department to arbitrarily stop election reform and redistricting changes in all 50 states. To give one example, any states looking to require “proof of identity” to register or vote in their elections would first have to get the approval of the Justice Department. The goal is obviously to give liberal career lawyers in the Civil Rights Division, where I used to work, the power to stop state reforms such as requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote, which is a very reasonable reform needed to prevent noncitizens from illegally participating in elections.

Unemployment debate sparks GOP divisions
The bill also stipulates that any redistricting changes that would reduce, by three points or more, the proportion of minority voters in a district would also have to get Justice Department approval. It would make it much easier for activist groups to sue state and local governments and get injunctions against changes they do not like. Rather than having to prove their case like any other plaintiff in any other case in any other court, all they would have to do is raise a “serious question” of whether the change violates the law and will pose a “hardship” to the plaintiff.
The Constitution grants states the right to administer their own elections. If it passes, the bill would gut that right and empower liberal activists to stop the election reforms needed to protect the integrity of the electoral process. It would also enable them to manipulate redistricting to help the candidates and political parties they favor. The bill is flat out bad policy and a blatant attempt to take over and federalize the election process.

0,12/02/19 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/472613-why-the-western-balkans-still-matter,Why the Western Balkans still matter,"The Western Balkans, a region made up of six tiny European nations, is smaller than Michigan and less populated than New York. Historically, as an unstable area during the 1990s, it was an important and integral to United States foreign policy, as evidenced by intervention to prevent ethnic cleansing and promote a Europe that could be truly whole and at peace. Three decades of active American engagement in this region has been marked more by success than by failure. But delayed American engagement in the Western Balkans in the late 1980s cost many lives.
It is enough to remember the tragedy of ethnic cleansing undertaken by the Serbian regime in Belgrade and the famous remarks by American Secretary of State James Baker that the United States had “no dog in this fight.” His view reflected a widespread illusion that the Europeans could have taken a leadership role in stopping the violence spurred by Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic. That idea was shared by many European leaders at the time, culminating in the remarkably naive statement by former Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos that this would be “the hour of Europe.” The European Union proved unable to undertake serious actions to stop the systematic murdering in Yugoslavia, particularly in Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina. Only within the framework of NATO, and with muscular American engagement, were the allies able to end the war in Bosnia in 1995 and then stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo in 1999.
Those with a sense of history understand that local developments in the Western Balkans are never really local. The region remains a geopolitical zone of great players, all of whom often have contradictory interests and strategic goals. When players like Russia try to increase their influence, the result is to exacerbate regional instability. Western engagement, in contrast, seeks to stabilize the region. China, as a new player without historical, economic, and cultural ties with the Western Balkans, is now trying to increase its economic expansion and political leverage as a part of its “One Belt One Road” project and a platform that gathers a number of Western Balkan and East European countries, including a number of NATO members and European Union nations, into common projects.
When the conflict in Kosovo turned violent in 1998, President Clinton dispatched three top diplomats, Robert Gelbard, Christopher Hill, and Richard Holbrooke. Just after the Americans criticized the passivity of Europeans, the central government appointed Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch, the top Austrian diplomat to Belgrade, as a special envoy to Kosovo. The United States has now reactivated diplomatic power with the appointment of Matthew Palmer as a special envoy for the Western Balkans as well as the appointment of Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany, as a special envoy for the Kosovo and Serbia dialogue, which highlights the importance of the Western Balkans to American diplomacy. The European Union has facilitated talks between Kosovo and Serbia since they started back in 2011, but these have not produced expected results.

From the beginning of the Belgrade and Pristina dialogue, one thing was clear, which was that the goal of the normalization process should be mutual bilateral recognition. Although the European Union has led the Belgrade and Pristina dialogue, the United States has indeed played an important background role. When the United States and the European Union work closely together and share the same point of view for the Western Balkans, one sees hope and progress. When the United States and the European Union disagree, all one sees is slippage and failure.
Reaching a final agreement between Kosovo and Serbia and witnessing them joining the European Union should be a “transatlantic hour” for the partnership between the United States and the European Union. Daniel Hamilton, a great expert on this relationship, wrote that the common transatlantic interests can be “best advanced with an America that is a European power, not just a power in Europe.” Three decades ago, former Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock made the choice clear. “Either we do it,” he said, referring to cooperation, “or the others do it, but they will do it differently.” Europe after the Second World War has been a success story because it was seen by both sides of the ocean as the transatlantic hour,” and by an America as a European power, not simply a power in Europe.

Politics is noisy and divided. That noise once stayed in sleepy marble halls and the black and white pages of the newspaper. Now that we are constantly surrounded by politics in our everyday lives, what in all this rancor is there to be thankful for?
Politics even wades into what should be the “purest” and “safest” time possible, time with family and friends. There are countless blog posts, podcast segments, and taped filler on the morning news shows about how to deal with political disagreements at Thanksgiving dinner. Early imbibing followed by sitting at cramped dinner tables will heighten any sense of intergenerational strife. Discussions about hot button issues may descend into an exchange of tropes about millennials, met with eye rolls and “okay, boomer.” While everyone is with their phones, there could be that aunt or uncle or niece or nephew who posted a meme about, say, immigration, that came from, depending on your inclination, either a Russian internet factory or an astroturfer funded by George Soros.
All the big topics we talk about inside the Beltway can find their way to Thanksgiving dinner. The intergenerational tension plays out during the debates on how to pay for a range of debts without overwhelming the potential of the future. We see this in climate, education, infrastructure, criminal justice, and the rapidly growing deficit. Culture wars divide us at home, while we debate our approach to a more interconnected world, paradoxically one healthier and more enlightened than ever before, yet also seeming so unstable and precarious. All of this comes through an inescapable news cycle, with reports delivered through a combination of personally selected partisan news outlets, precisely targeted algorithms, and social media platforms vulnerable to both foreign disinformation and everything in between from mere group think to total mob mentality.
Take a moment to think about all those things. In a strange way, each of those issues that divides us is tied to something for which we can be thankful. The many news outlets we can choose from, as partisan as they may be, are the result of a free press. Social media exists because we live in an era defined by technological innovation that previous generations could never imagine. We can have heated debates about our role in the world and openness to trade, immigration, and military posture because we are a prosperous and strong nation, one that is a beacon of hope to not only dreamers and thinkers but also those who seek freedom.

Indeed, those significant issues are the results of decades of prosperity and growth. No generation leaves big debts like that to the future out of malice. Rather they reflect the social, cultural, political, and technological limitations of their times. Therefore, we can be thankful not only for the advances we have made and the prosperity we have enjoyed but also that we have driven, engaged, educated, and globalized young Americans ready to take up the mantle of leadership for the next generation.
We can be thankful as Americans that we have this bounty. Our politics, like any family, can be messy. But like any family, we are stronger together. Just as we want a family to be healthy, happy, and growing, we want the same for our country, despite our partisan leanings. This Thanksgiving, let us take some time away from politics, however, let us remember that our shared experience gives us much for which we can be grateful for.

0,11/28/19 07:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/472164-thanksgiving-in-2019-lets-put-our-differences-aside,Thanksgiving in 2019: Let's put our differences aside,"As we gather with friends and family around tables topped with turkey and pumpkin pie this Thanksgiving, we feast and give thanks in seemingly uncivil times. Last month Georgetown University’s Battleground Civility poll warned us that ""the average voter believes the U.S. is two-thirds of the way to the edge of a civil war.""
Though Thanksgiving and civil war don't seem to go together, the timing of our annual Thanksgiving tradition was actually born during America’s Civil War. 
When President Lincoln called on “my fellow citizens in every part of the United States” to give thanks “with one heart and voice by the whole American people,” on Oct. 3, 1863, he received immediate pushback in the polarized press.
Newspapers in the South went to war against Thanksgiving.
“King Abraham has issued a proclamation appointing the last Thursday in November as a day of Thanksgiving and prayer in Yankeedom,” South Carolina’s Charleston Courier clamored on Oct. 12.
Georgia’s Augusta Chronicle went further on Oct. 15 by accusing the long-winded Lincoln of fake news. “The document is on par with the rest of the productions that have been sent out from Washington. Bombastic in tone and full of false statements. In a Thanksgiving proclamation one would suppose that Lincoln would tell the truth, but he has not.""  
Still another newspaper opposed Lincoln’s attempt to usurp state holidays for a united national one. Up until then, governors in each state had set aside different days for Thanksgiving, which was confusing. 
“Now Lincoln comes out this year with an appointment of his own in November, in order to supersede state appointments and teach the people to look to the federal government for holidays as well as everything else,” Georgia’s Macon Telegraph railed on Oct. 14 against this “darling scheme of the Lincolnites.” 
They predicted that: “A Grand National Thanksgiving is hereafter to supersede the state Thanksgivings. To get rid of the states in every possible attribute of government is an absorbing idea with the Lincoln administration.”
How did Northern newspapers respond? In contrast they put a positive spin on giving thanks. Cleveland's Plain Dealer was thrilled on Oct. 25 that “the whole North will be eating Thanksgiving dinners and mingling in social glee together upon that occasion. What a grand spectacle!”
The Plain Dealer decried the “few old croakers in the community who will growlingly assert that we have nothing much to be thankful for this year.” Despite the war, Lincoln wanted Americans to give thanks for blessings, such as economic and population growth.
The Plain Dealer was grateful for their victory at Gettysburg. “We can be thankful - yeah a thousand times thankful — for the victories over the rebels achieved by our glorious soldiers.”
With all of this political polarization, when and how did Americans unite around Thanksgiving as a national November holiday?
It took longer than 10 years. 
""In the New England states, Thanksgiving Day is looked forward to with even greater pleasure than Christmas,"" Georgia's Augusta Chronicle derided a decade later  on Nov. 27, 1873, while observing that those closer to Plymouth Rock ""prepare mountains of donuts and pumpkin pies for the occasion, the fattened goose is killed and everybody is full of the event.""
Instead in the South, Thanksgiving was still merely a day off, a time to close the banks, not a day to feast.
""In the middle and Southern States less attention is paid to the day, beyond its observation as a legal holiday and the services at the churches.""
Though Southerners still weren't feasting on pumpkin pie, they were beginning to give thanks, an improvement from their attitude against gratitude during Lincoln's era. 
""The South has cause for gratitude. Our country, desecrated by a long and bloody Civil War, has been steadily recovering from the effects of that disastrous conflict. Our burned homes rebuilt . . . Our town has prospered and thrived,"" another writer for the  Augusta Chronicle noted.
Giving thanks and counting their blessings eventually brought Southerners around to be feasting and fully embracing Thanksgiving. The proof wasn’t in the pudding or football but in the turkey.
“The traditional Thanksgiving turkey has taken his accustomed place in our market,” Georgia’s Macon Telegraph proudly published on Nov. 25, 1883, while noting that local boys  were enjoying a game that literally ruffled his gobbleship’s feathers. 
Twenty years after Lincoln declared the last Thursday in November as the annual day of Thanksgiving, Southerners and Northerners alike were all feasting. Counting their blessings is what ended the South's war against Thanksgiving.
A prayer published by New York's  Jewish Messenger shortly after Lincoln's Proclamation predicted that giving thanks to God would make help make Americans stronger and bring them together. 
“To him, enthroned on high, be the glory, the praise, the Thanksgiving! In humility and sincerity we bow . . . and offer him a hymn of thankfulness, that the nation has not been prostrated by the fearful blow struck from its midst, but that it is emerging from the ordeal stronger and better than ever.”
Like this prayer, Thanksgiving in 2019 can be a day to give thanks for the good things in our personal lives and the positive things in our nation — despite our civil divisions and trials.

Instead of discussing differences over a turkey dinner, taking time to show appreciation for the people at our table, their talents, their presence and their lives is a way to count blessings and overcome differences. Making thanksgiving about others and showing empathy over emphasizing our own opinions is a way to emerge stronger and better than before. 
The Augusta Chronicle's prayer of 1873 is still relevant to life today: ""Let us forget then what little of misfortune, what little of trouble we have experienced and remembering only the blessings which have been so bounteously bestowed upon us as a people and as individuals.""

0,11/26/19 05:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/472155-why-america-needed-donald-trump,Why America needed Donald Trump,"There is one good thing about President Trump
going into 2020. It is that he is consistent. Consistency in some philosophies connotes reliability. His divisive and inflammatory rhetoric, bullying mockery of others during campaign rallies, combative foreign policy, his rejection of diplomacy, and his demand for unequivocal loyalty have seriously disturbed the political establishment. This is an establishment that, in the minds of Americans on both the right and the left, has become consumed by its own interests.
Despite the disappointment and feelings of grievances, Americans have come to expect a certain level of civility in political life. They expect prevarications and empty promises masked by the warm embrace of civility. Both civility and character have been political standards that Americans have used to judge the body of politics in this country.
These guiding principles have become the critical appropriation and embodiment of traditions that have shaped the character and shared meaning of a people in these United States. Political communication should be grounded in our personal narratives. Citizens do not emerge from a historical vacuum. They arise from particular traditions. As such, some are taught to speak authoritatively yet compassionately, and they take action responsibly with the aim of serving the collective good.
Trump clearly does not abide by these standards. He questions the very legitimacy and agency of tradition and its meaning in the United States. He is a creature unwedded to basic conservative or liberal doctrines and is unconcerned with orthodoxy. From his view and that of his supporters, Washington tradition has not worked, and it is that grievance toward the status quo that has given Trump sustenance today. The peculiarity of this phenomenon is not relegated to just the political right. Similar sentiments are growing on the left and have given rise to Senator Bernie Sanders
, Senator Elizabeth Warren
, and other emerging progressive stars in the Democratic Party such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.
Americans have far deeper issues than partisan divides. Though their grievances are disparate, they share one commonality in their dislike for all things closely aligned with the elite media, politicians, and business. This is one of the reasons for the cultish following of the president, who can do no wrong in the eyes of his worshippers. It does not bother them because Trump exposes the disguise of civility, just as Sanders and Warren do. They “stick it to the man” by castigating political elites.
As for African Americans and members of other racial minority groups, we have fared no better or worse under Trump than we have under previous administrations. We may have felt better under President Obama because of symbolic racial pride, but we agree that many expectations fell short. The economy did well under President Clinton, but we acknowledge the dangerous crime bill and tough law enforcement stances that decimated the black community. The point is simple in that feeling good or having pride in our national leader does not necessarily yield good results.
What Trump says and does, through his rhetoric and behavior, can be brutally honest. While it may wound the vanity of some, he has complete disregard for business as usual. We must ask ourselves if we would rather have a president who does not care about political civility and “tells it like it is” or a president who is polished and hides the truth. Whatever you think about Trump and his supporters, it appears there is a growing number of Americans on both sides seeking a leader who is a street fighter, someone who will voice their grievances on center stage.

Americans are accustomed to the former civil politician. They smile at you, look you in the eyes, and tell you what you want to hear to make us feel comfortable. Whether we are willing to admit it or not, everything about the status quo before Trump signaled comfort. We were living in a country devoid of disruptive change. The reality was that it was business as usual, but those dynamics have been changing under the leadership of Trump. Despite the disdain some have for him, a similar movement has taken place on the left. The country needed Trump to shake things up.
In the blockbuster hit “The Dark Knight,” the Joker said to district attorney Harvey Dent, “Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I am an agent of chaos. And you know the thing about chaos? It is fair!” Trump is indeed fair to Americans because his disruption brings a shared level of chaos to the elites on all sides.

from office in order to unite the country, there was an awful lot of pressure for absolute partisan loyalty across the Democratic debate stage last week.
Kamala Harris, who runs her campaign promising to be a “president for all the people,” claimed that one of her rivals, Tulsi Gabbard, is not qualified to be the Democratic nominee because she has appeared on Fox News and has occasionally criticized members of her own party. It is difficult to be the “president for all the people” when you ignore half the voters in the country while insisting on absolute fealty to the party, but Harris did not see the irony here. She closed her attack by saying that Democrats need to choose someone who can “bring the party and the nation together.”
Vanity candidate Andrew Yang has also tried to position himself “not left, not right, but forward.” He has even courted the wrath of the resistance by saying he has no problem with Trump supporters. But in the debate, he quipped that if he won, the first thing he would tell Russian President Vladimir Putin would be, “Sorry I beat your guy.” Referring to Trump like that is an insult to the 63 million Americans who sent him to the White House in an Electoral College victory. It is a stretch to claim that you are not ideological when you spout partisan narratives pushed by resentful campaign operatives to deflect the blame for their own crushing defeat.
Other candidates simply could not resist disparaging major portions of the electorate while trying to tout their ability to unify the country. Pete Buttigieg, who has tried to position himself as a moderate perhaps more aggressively than other candidates, melodramatically claimed that he sometimes feels “like a stranger” in his own country because he is gay. That might be the way he views it, but this is at odds with most of us.
The rhetoric underscores a darker reality. The Democratic socialist agenda is, with few exceptions, unpopular outside activist circles. Public support for “Medicare for All,” for instance, plummets once people learn that they might be forced to give up their current health plans. The wealth taxes touted by Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, are under fire from all directions, with economists pointing out that wealth taxes are notoriously inefficient and difficult to administer, producing far less revenue than is projected.

Then there are the truly outlandish proposals that do not even require a rebuttal because their flaws are so readily apparent, such as public health care for illegal aliens or raising taxes on the middle class. After three years of extreme opposition to Trump, liberal activists are leading the way in this primary process. Passing their partisan purity test is putting candidates in an awkward position, forcing them to argue in effect that the only way to unify the country is through partisan politics and Democratic socialism.
It is still unclear who will come out on top of this food fight, but whoever does will have to answer for hours of footage from a primary process that directly contradicts the “unite the country” applause lines. The Democrats seem to think they can unite the country by slandering their opponents into submission. They need to realize that getting rid of Trump will not make the 63 million Americans who voted for him disappear next year.

The federal government must do more to protect clean water, air quality, animals, open lands and reduce the effects of climate change, according to a majority of respondents in the survey released Monday by the Pew Research Center.
The survey broke down along party lines, with 90 percent of those who identified as Democrats saying they believe the federal government is doing “too little” to address climate change and just 39 percent of self-identifying Republicans saying the same.
However, Republicans within the millennial and younger generations showed more concern than their older counterparts, with about 52 percent of those between the age of 18-38 saying they think the federal government isn’t doing enough to fight climate change, compared to 41 percent of Generation X respondents and 31 percent of the Baby Boomer and older group.
Pew conducted the survey with 3,627 U.S. adults between Oct. 1-13. It has a margin of error of 2.1 percentage points. 
The results highlight a growing national trend of Americans concerned about the effects of climate change and how opinions on how best to act has split the political parties and various generations. A number of polls this year have shown that climate change has grown as a top issue among Democratic voters, making climate action a top speaking point within the Democratic primaries. 
Surveys continue to also show that the issue is one of most concern among younger generations, with Republican youth particularly split from older GOP generations about the need to address, and vote on, the issue. The Pew survey underscores that divide, potentially offering a window to presidential candidates hoping to win over climate-minded right-wing voters.
The survey additionally found a national consensus over the need to shift energy consumption and production toward renewables. About three-quarters of Americans polled agreed developing wind, solar, hydrogen and other alternative energy sources over fossil fuels should be a priority. 
Among Democrats, 90 percent believe renewable energy sources should be prioritized over oil, gas and coal, according to the study. For Republicans, women supported alternative energy over fossil fuels at a higher percentage, 66 percent to 32 percent. Republican men had a slimmer majority, supporting alternative energy development 58 percent to 42 percent.
The poll showed that there still remains a clear split among conservative Republicans over what fuel source to prioritize. Conservatives, who represent the party majority, are evenly divided at 49 percent over the issue.
The comprehensive climate study found that factors such as geographical location and temperatures fed into Americans' points of view on climate action.

About 62 percent of those polled said their communities were already feeling the effects of climate change, with a vast majority saying unusually hot weather there indicated global warming.
Recent weather events across many states have already started affecting political outlooks, adding to a change in talking points within communities and in some public offices. Americans who reported the effects of climate change were notable by region, the study found. Residents of Pacific states including California, Washington and Hawaii, are the most likely to say they saw at least some local impacts of climate change, 72 percent.
The study additionally found that residents who reside near coastlines across the U.S. are more likely to say they are witnessing the effects of climate change in their communities. According to the survey, respondents living within 25 miles of any coastline are somewhat more inclined to say that climate change is having some effect, at 67 percent. That’s in comparison to those living between 25 and 300 miles inland, 60 percent, and more than 300 miles inland, 59 percent."
0,11/20/19 07:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/471349-pete-buttigieg-has-now-lost-all-confidence-from-black-voters,Pete Buttigieg has now lost all confidence from black voters,"Imagine being so desperate for support from a set of voters that you twist the truth to improve your standing. But that is exactly what Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg
has done in South Carolina. With only 2 percent support among African Americans according to an average of national polls, Buttigieg is attempting to pull the wool over the eyes of black voters by touting support from high profile African Americans in South Carolina by saying that they support his “Douglass Plan” for black citizens. However, there is one problem with that. None of it is true.
As noted by the Intercept, several prominent African Americans in South Carolina whom the Buttigieg campaign touted as endorsing his plan have publicly come out saying they did no such thing. Some of them are even supporting and endorsing other candidates. So what gives? It is pure and simple desperation. Despite being the current frontrunner among his fellow candidates in Iowa, Buttigieg knows what we all know. You simply cannot become the Democratic nominee without African Americans.
All the fundraising in the world cannot save the young politician from Indiana, and doing well in a state that more closely resembles Norway than the rest of the United States does not help his case. His trouble with black voters runs deep, and there are two issues that make it clear why an overwhelming majority of them will not support his bid for president.
After being sworn in as mayor of South Bend almost eight years ago, Buttigieg asked for the resignation of Darryl Boykins, the first African American police chief there. Boykins initially complied but later rescinded that decision. He was demoted to captain and eventually retired. Boykins allegedly caught white officers on tape making racist comments. Buttigieg sought to penalize Boykins by using the excuse that he was pressured by federal prosecutors to fire Boykins for violating the Wiretap Act.
However, Boykins argued it was a standard part of department procedure to wiretap certain phone lines. Boykins and his attorney questioned the claim by Buttigieg that the mayor was pressured by federal prosecutors, and later won a racial discrimination suit in which he received $50,000 from the city of South Bend. This case is important because it shows that Buttigieg is incapable of properly dealing with any allegations of racism. Considering the deleterious relationship many black communities across the United States have with police, it would be like committing suicide to put faith in his ability to heal the nation and solve this problem.
Pause for concern does not end there. Earlier this year, there was a police shooting in South Bend, and Buttigieg left the campaign trail to deal with the issue at home. With the media following closely behind, the mayor came off as both aloof and tone deaf to the pain and anger of local black residents. In a heated exchange, an understandably upset and emotional African American woman asked, “You want black people to vote for you?” Buttigieg shockingly answered, “I am not asking for your vote.”

The visual of that moment had an impact that rippled across the entire black community. He was disrespectful and arrogant. He displayed an unwillingness to immerse himself in the pain of his constituents, and that moment alone was a disqualifying fall from which he may never recover. From the way he fired Boykins to his response to the shooting, Buttigieg has shown black voters that he is not ready to lead a country divided and plagued with racial issues that warrant a more experienced leader.
Attempting to deceive black voters like he did in South Carolina is an intellectual insult to African Americans and marks another reason why black voters will likely remain apprehensive of Buttigieg. For many black voters, the calculation is simple. If Buttigieg is poorly equipped to deal with matters of race in a place as small as South Bend, then he certainly is not capable of dealing with them across the entire United States.

really adding another article of impeachment over “witness intimidation” because President Trump
tweeted criticism of a witness? There is no better proof that Democrats are making up their impeachment ploy as they go along.
Yet for all their grandstanding, there is just no way that the tweets about Marie Yovanovitch
could constitute witness intimidation, not the least because she was already testifying publicly when Trump sent them out. Witness intimidation is an action intended to make a witness so fearful of the consequences that he or she will not testify or potentially even lie.
The tweets about the reasons that Trump fired his own ambassador, about his own opinions of her job performance, and about her motivations for testifying are not intimidation. Yovanovitch herself admitted she has no firsthand knowledge of any alleged impeachable conduct. Her testimony amounted to an hours long human resources complaint surrounding the circumstances of her dismissal from the State Department. The tweets that Trump sent out during the hearing presented his side of the case.
Even if one accepts the allegation by Schiff at face value and interprets the tweets as a veiled threat against Yovanovitch, it still does should not constitute witness intimidation. Yovanovitch was already testifying at the time, and only found out about the tweets because Schiff read them to her. If somehow this knowledge of the tweets would have suddenly made Yovanovitch start lying on the stand, then one could argue that it was Schiff who was intimidating the witness by mentioning these tweets.

The biggest issue, however, is not that Schiff is wrong. He should know he is wrong, and he went out of his way to construct his absurd allegation. He has a law degree from Harvard University. He was a federal prosecutor. He knows full well that nothing in the tweets would be construed as “witness intimidation” by any court in the country. He clearly heard, probably from one of his staff members, that Trump was tweeting about the witness on the stand, and decided to see if he could use it to his political benefit.
What does that sort of dishonesty from the face of this impeachment say about the strength of the underlying case Democrats have against the president? It should tell you that Schiff knows how thin his case is, and that he is searching frantically for anything to strengthen the narrative for his party. His many contortions as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee continue to expose the political motivations of this inquiry.

However, one Zen like question seemed to be left at the conclusion of the testimony. If a quid pro quo was uttered in Washington but no Ukrainians heard it, did it make an impeachable sound?
After all of the atmospherics and personalities, that may be the question given to the Senate for a trial in 2020. It comes down to timelines that both parties seemed eager to construct. Despite their different points of emphasis, we now have a clearer picture on a couple of points. House Democrats succeeded in presenting a compelling case that a quid pro quo was conveyed to various American players. However, it also seems clear that it was not conveyed to the Ukrainians until a few days before American military aid was actually released by the White House.
Ambassador William Taylor offered a key piece of information when he recalled with certainty that Ukrainian officials did not appear to know about any quid pro quo until after a Politico article on August 29. As soon as they learned of the possible condition of an investigation in exchange for aid, they contacted him. Thus, despite the desire of President Trump
for investigations into the Ukrainian role in the 2016 election and the Hunter Biden controversy, we have a firm date for when the Ukrainian officials presumably knew about the precondition for aid.
For Republicans, this date is reinforced by the fact that there were at least three meetings with the Ukrainian president over 55 days without mention of a precondition or a quid pro quo. A second date, September 11, is equally important. That is when the aid was released by the White House. That means there was less than two weeks between the Ukrainians raising an alleged quid pro quo and the release of the aid. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee like Joaquin Castro of Texas insisted this is just like attempted murder, unsuccessful, but still a crime. However, the law of attempt is based on clearly defined attempted crimes. It is far from established that a request or even a demand for investigations is a criminal or impeachable offense in this context.
Witnesses established that Trump requested an investigation into both 2016 election interference and the Hunter Biden contract. The first request is not and cannot be an impeachable offense. After all, United States Attorney John Durham is already leading an investigation into those allegations, including the involvement of Ukrainian figures cited as the source for information in the dossier from Chistopher Steele. It is not uncommon for presidents to encourage other heads of state to assist in such probes. Durham, a respected career prosecutor, recommended recently that his investigation be elevated to a criminal inquiry.
The references to the Biden investigation, in contrast, do raise legitimate questions for Congress. But this would be a stronger case if Trump was demanding a particular result or criminal charge from any investigation. The United States had previously asked for such investigations, and George Kent considered the Hunter Biden contract to be serious enough to raise at the State Department and directly with the office of Vice President Biden at the time. If one concludes that the Hunter Biden contract was indeed corrupt influence peddling, then the demand for an investigation takes on a slightly different cast, even if many of us view that demand as inappropriate, given its focus on a political rival.
It also would be a stronger case if American aid had been withheld until Ukrainian fulfillment of any preconditions. Instead, less than two weeks after raising the matter, the aid was released. Democrats raise a good point that the aid was released 48 hours after the intelligence community inspector general referred a whistleblower complaint to Congress, and the White House knew the issue would blow up in. However, we still do not know if the aid would have continued to be withheld if the Ukrainians failed to meet the alleged demand by Trump for investigations.
That conjectural element would create a dangerously low standard for impeachment. Transcripts of presidential conversations, from Lyndon Johnson to Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, would indeed likely show discussions of political considerations with heads of state. Impeaching a president over asking for investigations into alleged corruption would expose future presidents to similar scrutiny. The timing or substance of actions by other countries often benefit presidents. When would such conversations be subject to review and possible impeachment?
One does not need a crime for impeachment, but without a criminal allegation there is a heightened burden to clearly define the scope of impeachable “abuse.” Otherwise, every communication with a head of state could be challenged as touching on actions that would benefit a president politically. In the impeachment of Bill Clinton
, Democrats said that a president lying under oath was not impeachable because it did not “rise to the level of impeachable offenses.”
Now Democrats argue that some noncrimes constitute impeachable offenses as “abuses,” but they have yet to offer a clear limiting principle for future presidents. Since presidents often act or seek actions that benefit them politically, a “bright line” needs to be established if we do not want to reduce impeachment to simply a discretionary power of the majority. Of course, Republicans face their own challenges over defining lines. Taylor and Kent made compelling cases in their testimony for why the withholding of military aid was wrong and dangerous. Rather than defending the indefensible, most Republicans are not supporting the withholding of American military aid but are citing the fact that it was eventually released. That is hardly a moral high ground.
Listening to the Republicans reminded me of a case related to me by the Irish ambassador to the United States and a former defense lawyer. It seems that an Englishman accused an Irishman of stealing a pair of boots. The guilt of the defendant was abundantly obvious, but the Irish jury ruled against the Englishman. On the acquittal form, however, they added a line, “We do believe O’Brien should give the Englishman back his boots.” In a strange sense, the jury felt justice had been done.

In declaring Trump innocent, some Republicans seem to be adding that they are glad he eventually handed over the aid. That nuanced ethical position is likely to be lost on most voters. However, “contemptible” is not synonymous with “impeachable” in this context. The simply fact is that presidents often commit abuses. Reagan was accused of delaying the release of Americans held hostage by Iran until he was elected. Clinton pardoned a Democratic Party donor and his own half brother.
So what abuses of power are impeachable rather than contemptible? Congress soon will be meditating over the “Trump Impeachment Zen.” The difference is that, unlike real Zen, no one expects wisdom to follow the contemplation of this paradoxical political question.

from office, but after the election is over and all the votes have been cast, the party of Barack Obama has a problem that even winning the White House will not solve. Democrats do not have a plan after Trump leaves office. His constant manipulation of the media and unnerving ability to dominate the news cycle have united Democrats in opposition, but they need a critical debate over the direction of the party moving forward. Democrats have been able to delay the inevitable policy battle between the progressives and moderates in the party, but that will not always be the case.
Even President Obama, a modern icon of the party, faced harsh criticism from the progressive wing for not going far enough in terms of his policy proposals and for his attempts to work with Republicans during his time in the White House. Heading into the election, voters are finally starting to see the divide spill over into the Democratic primary and potentially lead to an all out fracturing within the party. Unfortunately for Democrats, the questions that they must ask themselves are not easily answerable.
Are Democrats the party of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, avowed socialists willing to take the fight to Wall Street and upset the status quo? Or are they the party of Joe Biden and Barack Obama, more measured and moderate politicians, looking to change Washington from the inside? Democrats have avoided an ugly battle for the better part of the last two decades, but time is not on their side. The longer they avoid addressing the policy and messaging differences within the party, the more of a chance Republicans will have to define Democrats as out of touch.
Democrats can resonate with both progressives and moderates. It comes down to messaging. Instead of allowing Republicans to paint socialism in a negative light that taints the party and distracts voters, Democrats have to explain that many policies with broad support from Americans of all affiliations are rooted in the foundation of socialism. Social Security, Medicare, unemployment, and aid to farmers are all socialist programs that both parties support. By explaining that some socialism is good, Democrats can begin to alleviate the fears that Republicans have sent across the country through cable news and conservative talking points.
Democrats are known as the big tent party and their views should reflect that. What works for Gavin Newsom in California will not work for Andy Beshear in Kentucky. Purity tests and the nationalization of every single campaign is a surefire way to turn the big tent party into a weakened party. Democrats should elect candidates who reflect the views of the district or state they are running in. There is nothing wrong with that.
Forming a circular political firing squad does the work of Republicans and will no doubt cause irreparable harm to the party, especially given the minor differences between progressives and moderates. When it comes to foundational issues such as universal health care, climate change, early education, and income equality, there is unanimous agreement. While there are some measured differences on the policies to solve these issues, those differences can be resolved without burning the entire party down.

Time is running out for Democrats to avoid making the same mistake that Republicans have made over the last decade. Democrats cannot continue to avoid the antagonistic tendencies between the two wings of the party. Doing so will only make the inevitable reckoning more difficult. Like a dispute in any relationship, the longer you avoid a difficult conversation, the more the conversation becomes less about the original dispute and more about other things. As a wise person once told me, “Avoidance is not deliverance.” With demographics shifting more in their favor each day, Democrats need to do the hard work of building a party that can last.
Democrats will eventually lose Trump as their foil. When that happens, whether in 2020 or in 2024, they will be forced to figure out what their central message is and who will lead them. The inability of Republicans to answer these questions and have an honest discussion about shifting demographics and an emerging nationalist message is what led to Trump. Democrats cannot allow the same to happen to them. As Republicans have proven, a fractured party is ripe for a takeover. Democrats do not have a plan after Trump leaves office. He will not be around forever to distract. An honest dialogue is the only way to solve this problem.

leaves office. Whether Republicans win and secure another four years in control of the White House or suffer a humiliating defeat at the hands of Democrats, one thing is certain. Donald Trump will not be around in politics forever. At some point, his grip on Republicans will be relinquished, and members of the Grand Old Party will be left to figure out what comes next.
What was once the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan now appears to be a shell of its former self. What is undeniable is that the Trump takeover of the Republican Party has been nothing short of historic. Gone are challenges to his inflammatory rhetoric. Lost are the voices of reason who could disagree with party leadership without finding themselves devoid of political support. What is left is a party in shambles unsure of what it will look like after the chaos of the Trump era.
Trump is a reflection of the Republican desire to win at all costs. This mentality may have afforded them the ability to appoint judges and pass massive tax cuts, but at what costs in the long term? Is winning really winning if it costs the soul of your party? Make no mistake, the Republican Party bowing to Trump is not without consequence. As demographics shift and lawmakers attempt to connect with a new generation of voters, Republicans will find themselves on the brink of a crisis. While Trump may be a short term solution, he has created a long term problem.
Republicans need to bring in minorities to avoid becoming a regional party, but these voters are completely turned off by the racist language emanating from the White House. What works on cable news does not translate to those who do not regularly consume conservative media. Polls also show millennial support for the president is low, which is not sustainable for the party. While Reagan may have ushered in a new generation of Republicans, Trump is bringing out a new generation of Democrats that may turn states like Texas blue for decades.
If Republicans have any hope of rebuilding their party and figuring out a path forward, it begins with abandoning Trump, not continuing their acts of surrender. Republicans like Jeff Sessions and Ted Cruz cannot allow themselves to be humiliated by his vicious taunts then seek support from those who allow them. A neutered Republican Party cannot be rebirthed if it lacks the political courage to find its backbone. Republicans must instead follow the path of principled public servants like Justin Amash. While I may disagree with him on policy substance, I have nothing but respect for his consistency in the face of political expediency.

The party of small government has now been overcome by nationalism and devoid of any guiding principles. That is not just bad for the future of the Republican Party, it is bad for the future of our democracy. Our democracy requires two strong parties built upon a foundation of ideas and principles. At this moment in history, the Republican Party has found itself strangled by a president who threatens its existence. As Herbert George Wells declared, “Once you lose yourself, you have two choices. Find the person you used to be, or lose that person completely.”
There are not many guarantees in politics, but Trump will not be president forever. For the sake of our democracy and the stability of our country, it is time for Republicans to consider what the world will look like after he leaves office. If the Republican Party wants to stand the test of time, it must avoid turning inward and instead become more inclusive. It must reflect our diversity of ideas and demographics. Should it choose to continue down this path, it will lose itself forever. The country will move on, with or without Republicans in power. The choice is theirs.

0,11/12/19 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/470027-all-americans-lose-with-partisan-attacks-on-the-electoral-process,All Americans lose with partisan attacks on the electoral process,"In close elections, the playbook for losing candidates is well worn. They blame the voting process, undermine confidence in election results, and delegitimize the opposition. Both parties do it, and all Americans lose in the end. Political actors are incentivized to attack the legitimacy of the voting process. Take the gubernatorial race in Kentucky. Republican Governor Matt Bevin trails Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear, though it appears he is behind by an insurmountable margin. Bevin has every right under state law to request a recount to ensure the validity of the result. But instead of saying just that, he added an almost reflexive nod toward fraud by claiming undefined and unreported “irregularities.”
The intent is clear to make the process or other nefarious action be the reason he lost. Those who voted for Bevin will hear that message. In our era of hyperpolarization, it means that they will claim that the likely winner is illegitimate. Whatever Beshear does during his term can thus be easily written off as unfair or even illegal. Neither party is alone in undermining confidence in the legitimacy of the electoral process. Kentucky also saw a rather unusual “call” of the election for Beshear by Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes very shortly after polls closed and before the Associated Press made its traditional announcement of a winner. Calling results like this is not the job of any election official.
Election administrators at the local level are the front line for reporting results. They coordinate a logistical masterpiece whereby results from all the polling places under their control must be delivered, tallied, and reported as unofficial to the public. State officials to varying degrees aggregate these unofficial results and report them for statewide races. The state will certify the result as final in the weeks after Election Day.
Election night results are unofficial for a reason. First, it is the culmination of a long day. When votes are tallied in the precinct, tired poll workers are known to make transcription errors, which will be discovered later in the canvassing process. Second, every state permits some amount of voting by mail, and many states do not report those results right away. Finally, any provisional ballots cast on Election Day must be adjudicated.
A Democratic secretary of state who makes an election “call” during the initial and unofficial reporting of results in an extremely close race will unnecessarily poison the well when you consider her office will play a role in a recount or challenge. Why should voters, particularly those who are now primed to view the election results as illegitimate by their preferred candidate, believe that the recount can be done without bias?
Attacks on the system are now commonplace. Republicans tend to claim voter fraud, and Democrats cry voter suppression no matter the action taken. The truth is rarely so black and white. The Bipartisan Policy Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has released a report on polling place lines in 2018. The study spanned more than 3,100 precincts, 211 jurisdictions, and 11 states, accounting for 10.5 million votes cast, or about 9 percent of national turnout in the midterm elections. Jurisdiction size ranged from Metz Township in Michigan with 230 registered voters to San Diego County in California with nearly 3 million registered voters.
The good news is that in the 2018 midterm elections, the average voting wait time was just under 9 minutes, well within the acceptable 30 minute limit that is set by the bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Administration in 2014. The bad news is that nearly 5 percent of precincts averaged more than 30 minute wait times throughout Election Day. We found that the distribution of those very lengthy wait times is uneven. Precincts with a high portion of minority voters saw significantly longer wait times. In precincts with 10 percent or less minority voters, the average wait time was 5 minutes. In precincts with 90 percent or more minority voters, the average wait climbed to more than 32 minutes.

Some might use this data as proof that local election administrators are intent on suppressing turnout in some areas. But many factors contribute to long lines, and the administrators, mostly civil servants, tend to be focused on improving voter experience at the polls. More likely, these areas have been hampered by state and local policy decisions that limit investment in modernizing polling places with better technology and make it difficult to allocate resources to meet uneven demand.
It will take a lot of internal reflection and some difficult work on behalf of political actors, administrators, and the voters themselves to understand and value the importance of election legitimacy. We are all too cynical about the process and assume the worst. Instead, we must all allow the voting process to unfold as intended by state and federal law and believe that the electoral process in this country is worthy of our trust.

The report calls on Congress to institute a new federal certification program for vendors, arguing that without federal review American elections are exposed to further interference. 
“The federal government regulates colored pencils, which are subject to mandatory standards promulgated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, more stringently than it does America’s election infrastructure,” report authors Lawrence Norden, Gowri Ramachandran and Christopher Deluzio write.
The Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and public policy institute based out of New York University Law School, proposes a framework for congressional oversight that the authors said would help limit interference like what was reported to have happened in 2016. 
The report proposes Congress reconstitute the Election Assistance Commission, or whichever agency takes on the role, to include members with more cybersecurity expertise. 
It also proposes expanding the existing voluntary certification and registration process to provide vendors a “sufficient incentive to comply with best practices.” And the Brennan Center recommends the agency continually monitor vendors' quality and management practices. 
Norden, one of the three authors of the report and the director of the Brennan Center’s Election Reform Program, told The Hill that he had not reached out to the election equipment manufacturers about the recommendations, but that he believed that more oversight would actually be beneficial for these companies.
“They should welcome this as an opportunity to show what good work they are doing and make it clear to election officials who they can trust,” Norden said.
Norden said one of the key reasons for the report being compiled was to put the spotlight on how election machine vendors can improve security. 
“Most of the focus has been on election officials and what election officials can do to improve our election security, and I felt like election system vendors ... play a critical part in election security, and that role and what to do about it has largely been missing from the conversation,” Norden said.
The need for more election security funds for states to update cybersecurity practices and replace outdated voting machines is a key issue that many election officials unite behind. Congress appropriated $380 million for this last year, and both the House and Senate have proposed various levels of funding for the next fiscal year. 
Norden said that the $380 million ""was not enough"" to meet the election security needs of states, and advocated for Congress to approve more funds as soon as possible.
""I do think that the potential vulnerabilities that exist in the election system vendors have not really been dealt with, and that is just another reason to ensure that there is resiliency in our elections in 2020,"" Norden said.

0,11/06/19 08:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/468637-language-is-a-weapon-in-political-warfare-if-the-media-play-along,Language is a weapon in political warfare — if the media play along,"Language — or, more narrowly, words themselves — is the most potent weapon in political warfare. What you call something can powerfully influence how people perceive or think about it. If you’re tuned into how the phenomenon works, you see it happening clearly. 
The Democrats have had a sophisticated and visible language strategy since President Trump
was elected. Examples that stand out this year include their efforts to characterize what’s happening on our southern border as a “manufactured crisis.” Soon, news anchors and reporters were spouting “manufactured crisis” over and over. 
This was a centrally run effort — as was recent coverage of the Republicans who tried to enter the closed-door committee hearing regarding impeachment. Multiple reporters described the congressmen as “white” males. 
Other examples are more insidious, indicating a mindset or ideological framework that creeps into stories that try to be even-handed. For example, the New York Times wrote about a growing movement demanding old-fashioned dishwashers become available again. Why? Because they actually worked and performed their desired function, to wash dishes. Those pining for older washers identify the culprit squarely as over-regulation. In the middle of a fair story, the writer notes that the Trump administration is pursuing “weakening energy standards for lightbulbs,” unaware that another point of view — the same point of view reflected by those demanding dishwashers that wash — would describe these as “streamlining” or perhaps “rationalizing” standards, or “weighing the costs versus benefits.” 
At the same time, an interesting vocabulary battle is going on around gun issues — but this time the media are undecided about the script, or apparently unwilling to play along. The competition is between describing the desired action to promote gun safety by removing guns as a “mandatory buyback” or “confiscation.”
These are very different concepts. Gun opponents have been pushing “buybacks” for years. Churches (bless their hearts, as we say in Texas) have been sponsoring buybacks for years. It doesn’t take a genius to recognize that people voluntarily selling their guns to a religious third party are unlikely to be mass shooters or even single-shot shooters. 
The definition of a “buyback” is “the buying back of goods by the original seller,” fudging the idea of who was the original seller and popularized by corporate entities purchasing back their own shares or stock to reduce the number of shares outstanding — which a stock buyback would do, but a gun “buyback” would not. 
The phrase “mandatory buyback” hopes the public focuses on “buyback,” which connotes a transaction between two willing parties. The addition of the concept of “mandatory” panders to the segment of the populace that loathes the concept of individuals owning firearms. 
“Mandatory buyback” is competing with the word and concept “confiscate,” which is defined as “taking a possession away from someone when you have the right to do so,” frequently as “a punishment.” Some definitions include the concept of “taking or seizing (someone’s property) with authority.” This concept recognizes that “property” belongs to someone, and the confiscator asserts the “right” and the “authority” to seize it with or without consent. This is no less than a frontal assault on the concept of private property and the rule of law. 
Anyone who wonders what happens when the concept of private property is breached should take a look at Venezuela. It’s a shame that the study of American colonial history has fallen out of fashion because one of the issues that energized the colonists was the issue of respect for private property. 
Joined with this is the concept of “authority.” The American experiment was based on authority and freedom resting with the individual, as opposed to the state. What makes this such an interesting debate is that Democrats have not coalesced around whether to argue for a “buyback” or “confiscation,” and the media are visibly confused. 
To illustrate this, consider two articles from the Dallas Morning News. On Sept. 20, an article headlined “Beto O’Rourke’s demand for gun confiscation sparks feuds with Trump — and fellow Democrat Schumer” began by examining the call to “confiscate assault-style” weapons. By the fourth paragraph, the writer describes this as a “controversial gun buyback.” Six paragraphs later, it’s back to “a push for confiscation.” The article yo-yos back and forth for the following 14 paragraphs, which describe trying to “confiscate” weapons and support for “mandatory buybacks.” 
Nine days later, the confusion was demonstrated in another headline: “Could Beto O'Rourke
really take your guns? If government attempts a buyback, here's how it would work.” The first paragraph notes that some Democrats have amped up demand for banning and/or confiscating certain weapons. The first question in the Q&A format asks, “How many weapons would be confiscated?” The next question is: “Have other countries confiscated guns?” And the first sentence in the answer begins: “Australia implemented a mandatory buyback… .”

Wise advice comes from Matt Bennett, a liberal activist, co-founder of Third Way and a board member of several groups pushing for stringent regulation of gun ownership. When candidates such as O’Rourke push for a “mandatory buyback,” Bennett notes in a USA Today opinion piece, “If it’s mandatory that a gun is turned over to the government, that’s confiscation.” 
We should describe the language debate as a distraction and diversion from the real issues — for example, how to keep firearms in general, not just automatic weapons, out of the hands of people who are mentally deranged or who plan to use them for criminal purposes. The inescapable conclusion from years of evidence looking at the confiscation or relinquishment of so-called “assault-style weapons” is that the strategy doesn’t really work.

An independent and adventurous first lady, she reshaped and expanded the role and held the record as the most traveled first lady until Hillary Clinton. Pat Nixon was an activist for more women to run for elective office, encouraged her husband to appoint more women to federal positions as well as nominate a woman to the Supreme Court, opened up White House tours for the blind, established traditions such as garden tours, and as former White House Curator Betty Monkman told us at the panel discussion, Pat Nixon added more than 600 artifacts to the White House collection, more than any first lady before or since her.
She also “championed the lives of the underprivileged, the sick and the forgotten,” as stated in a letter from first lady Melania Trump
for an event two years ago, when Pat Nixon was honored at the University of Southern California marking 80 years since she graduated cum laude from the college. The relatively new first lady Melania Trump sent that letter to be read at the celebration, also stating that Pat Nixon is a “true role model” as first lady who is “worthy of our admiration and remembrance.”
Yet the image of Pat Nixon remains mired in passivity and stereotype. She never sought the limelight, but the problems of her husband and her willingness to stand by him during a difficult period overshadowed her accomplishments and overwhelmed her story as an activist for women, children and families, and for civic participation across our nation.
Some aspects of the role are too difficult to control, especially the “media crucible” as Betty Ford called it, that each first lady has faced since the founding of our nation. It can be challenging for first ladies to break through and be evaluated for their unique experiences. While it is too early to measure the full impact of the work of Melania Trump, it seems that in the political environment today, history is repeating itself with the coverage and understanding of her interests and initiatives.
In my work at American University, I examine the position of first ladies throughout our history and promote the influence these women have had on our politics, policy, and global diplomacy. First ladies are a fascinating topic in American history and culture. Thankfully through more scholarly research and events, with participation from journalists such as Ann Compton and the late Cokie Roberts, first ladies are receiving more attention for their accomplishments and their impact on key issues.
Equal attention is paid to their influence on preserving the White House as museum of history and decorative arts as well as a family residence of elegance and charm. This was a priority of first lady Jackie Kennedy, who founded the White House Historical Association in 1961 as the vehicle to preserve the building and enhance public understanding of its history and its occupants. As with other first ladies who embraced this responsibility, Melania Trump, in remarks at a White House dinner earlier this year, stated her gratitude “to live in this true symbol” of American history and “to play a part in restoring and enhancing” the White House for the public.

Free from specific statutory responsibilities, each first lady can choose how to use her powerful platform and put her unique stamp on the office. Melania Trump did not follow the past tradition of immediately moving to the White House after the inauguration and of hiring staff prior to the inauguration. Many were curious how she would approach her new role. “I will stay true to myself,” she said, thus not defined by the expectations others have of her, the position of first lady, or the staffing of her office.
As the historian William Seale said, “They may be criticized at first for not appearing to be like the women in the past who have held the job, yet they prevail for being themselves, which is what Americans want all along.”

0,10/28/19 02:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/467745-why-corporate-america-needs-to-have-a-code-of-conduct-for-china,Why corporate America needs to have a code of conduct for China,"The dispute between China and the National Basketball Association after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the Hong Kong protestors is the highest profile in a string of cases of the Chinese bullying American companies. China made Marriott apologize last year after a customer survey listed Taiwan, Tibet, and Hong Kong as separate countries, and China also required United States airlines to stop listing Taiwan as a separate country on their websites. This bullying fits right into a growing global practice of China demanding multinational companies toe its political line if they want to remain in its vast market.
As the United States and China enter this era of strategic competition, American companies face growing pressure from their own government over business in China. Congress and the administration are concerned that American technology may be facilitating Chinese activities that threaten United States national interests, from modernization of the Chinese military to the growing mass surveillance state and detention of more than a million Uighurs in Xinjiang province. There is increasing support across Washington for new export controls and sanctions that could sharply crimp the ability of American companies to sell their products to China, which is the second largest market in the world.
Corporate America needs to stand up to Chinese bullying and get ahead of government regulations by taking the approach that companies have successfully taken in other contexts and adopting voluntary corporate commitments to resist Chinese bullying while refraining from selling products and services to Chinese companies and government agencies that challenge the values and interests of the United States. American companies therefore need a corporate code of conduct for China.
A formal corporate code of conduct would help American companies stand up to Chinese bullying by creating collective resistance. For any individual business facing heat from Beijing, the commercial incentive is typically to cave to protect corporate market share in China. Companies worry that if they do not cave and China starts to limit their market access, other companies that avoided controversy by laying low on political issues will simply step in with their competing products.
A broad corporate code of conduct in which American companies will commit upfront to stand up to bullying and to speak out in support of others, however, would give them substantial leverage to resist Chinese pressure. While China is happy to squeeze individual companies, it does not want to squeeze American companies and industries as a whole, especially at a time when the Chinese economy is slowing and Beijing is interested in striking a trade deal with President Trump. Collection action would give American companies their own leverage to resist Beijing.
Signatory companies should commit that they will not retaliate against employees, contractors, suppliers, and customers who make public statements critical of Chinese policies or the Chinese government. Every American should be confident that employer will not retaliate against them simply for speaking out. Equally importantly, the signatories to a corporate code of conduct should commit that they will jointly issue public statements in defense of any individual company that Beijing attacks, creating a meaningful collective answer to Chinese pressure.
Companies should not only commit to standing up to Chinese bullying. They should also commit to opposing Chinese human rights abuses. Federal law already generally prohibits American companies from selling their products to the Chinese military. But American companies are not currently prohibited from selling technology to many Chinese companies that may in turn support Chinese surveillance and human rights abuses.

While there are proposals in Washington to begin prohibiting such sales, new legislation is uncertain and lawmakers will have to mitigate potential unintended consequences. Meanwhile, American companies, which are best positioned to understand how they can control the sale of their products to illicit ends in China while operating successfully in the Chinese market, should stand for democratic values by committing to develop industry standards to ensure that American products sold in China are not used to facilitate surveillance and human rights abuses.
No voluntary code of conduct is a panacea. China would test signatory companies that fail to toe its political line to see if American companies will really stand up for each other. Some American companies also may not want to invest in the kinds of due diligence required to ensure that Chinese customers do not in fact use American products for nefarious purposes. But the reality is that American companies are going to face increasing pressure from both Beijing and Washington in coming years as China and the United States compete. A corporate code of conduct would give American companies greater influence over their own fates, while standing for values against a China that increasingly tries to reject them.

0,10/27/19 07:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/467637-the-ship-has-sailed-for-michael-bloomberg-and-hillary-clinton,The ship has sailed for Michael Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton,"The hesitation among Democrats to solidify support around a single candidate has some primary voters hoping for a late entry by big name politicians like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
or 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton
. The whispers around their potential entrances into the 2020 race have only been amplified by reports that both politicians are unimpressed by the current field of candidates and are considering jumping into an already crowded primary field.
Bloomberg flirting with a run for president is nothing new this election cycle. He has repeatedly floated the possibility. In 2016, he raised the possibility of running as an independent if Senator Bernie Sanders were the Democratic nominee, and he once again created fodder inside the Washington Beltway when he announced earlier this year that he was considering jumping into the 2020 race as a Democrat. It has become somewhat of an annual tradition for pundits to debate if Bloomberg will come to the rescue of a party embracing its progressive values.
I can confidently predict that this election cycle will be no different than previous cycles when it comes to a potential Bloomberg candidacy. It is not happening, and for good reason. While Bloomberg may have the resources to run the type of campaign that would make even Tom Steyer blush, he has little organic support within the party and a political record that would turn him into a punching bag for candidates like Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren. It is not happening this far into the race.
The same can be said for 2016 Democratic nominee. Clinton may still haunt President Trump
in his nightmares, but she certainly will not be living in the White House again. If Democrats hope to defeat Trump and win back the White House, it is well past time for her to say out loud the thing that we all know she is saying behind closed doors, which is that she is not running for president. I say that with the utmost respect for the former secretary of state and all that she has done for our country.
While it may be fun to debate what a potential rematch between Clinton and Trump would look like, that is something I hope we never ever see again. It is not because I do not think she would be a better president than Trump, which I believe, but because the country and the party cannot afford to go down that path again. Campaign staff may want to relitigate the merits of 2016 and why she lost, but those arguments should be left to pundits. It does nothing to advance the interests of the party and is only a distraction for voters who want to settle on a Democratic nominee.
There are so many reasons why Clinton will not run for president in 2020, but the most practical reason is that it is too late. Campaigns have staffed up, donor bases have been accounted for, and the process to qualify for state ballots has begun. As Clinton is well aware, running for president is no small feat. Forming a campaign takes months of preparation and research. With less than 100 days until the Iowa caucuses, there is not enough time. That is probably a good thing because Democrats cannot afford to play defense, which is sure to happen if Clinton runs again.
Her candidacy would fracture the existing field even further and lead to a contested party convention in Milwaukee. That is a result that could be devastating to the chances of Democrats to recapture the White House. Further, Clinton would pull support from a range of candidates and water down their poll numbers. As much as some people wish she was running, she is not the right person to turn the page on the Trump presidency. Thankfully, I would be willing to bet the house that Clinton agrees with me. While she may enjoy stirring up hot takes on Twitter and staying on the mind of Trump, she has no intention of running for the nomination.

The current crop of candidates can rest confidently knowing that the field is set. The eventual Democratic nominee has already appeared onstage at one of the televised national debates, traveled extensively to the early voting states, and built up an apparatus that is prepared to take the fight directly to Republicans. There are not many things that one can be sure of in politics, but I can be sure that no one is coming in at the last minute to be the proverbial white knight. It is simply not happening at this point.
It is time for voters to focus on the field of Democratic candidates who have declared their intentions to run for president and decide who they support. It is never too early for the party to begin the difficult process of building up a coalition that can defeat Trump at the ballot box in 2020.

0,10/20/19 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/466648-red-states-are-the-economic-future,Red states are the economic future,"The conventional wisdom in politics is that the coasts represent the economic future of the United States. Higher incomes and potential growth seem to be with cities like New York, San Francisco, and Seattle. Even in the aftermath of her 2016 election loss, Hillary Clinton famously dismissed flyover country. She declared, “I won the places that represent two-thirds of American gross domestic product. So I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward.”
In many ways, however, the coastal regions that Clinton lauds represent the equivalent of a personal finance ponzi scheme. While many topline statistics like average income appear on the surface to show much higher standards of living in states like New York and California, a deeper dive into the numbers tells a different story altogether.
Poor policy decisions in blue states, including higher taxes on both the wealthy and working people, housing barriers, and higher prices due to regulation mean that higher incomes vanish upon inspection. When accounting for the cost of food, housing, and commodities, the dollar goes significantly further in red states than in it does in blue states. A hundred dollars will get you less than $90 worth of goods and services in New York and California. In Texas, Florida, and across the mountain west except for Colorado, a Benjamin Franklin will buy you more than its value. Across the midwest, the value actually exceeds $110.
Comparing state level purchasing power is a bit of raw data, especially considering the disparity of cost between rural and urban areas. When the same $100 is ranked by metropolitan area, the numbers get even starker. Across much of the south, the same bill will purchase more than $120 in goods and services. In Seattle it is $89, in Los Angeles it is $85, in Manhattan it is $82, and in San Francisco it is $78.
Even worse, these figures do not take into account the sky high cost of rent and taxes in blue states. The average cumulative tax rates in most of these Democratic strongholds is indeed far higher than their Republican counterparts. The combination of gas, sales, income, local, and capital gains taxes eats into the incomes of residents who live in New York, California, Illinois, and Connecticut even more.
Try an experiment using back of the envelope math. The average 2018 per capita income in New York is $68,690, while in Texas it is $50,360. At first glance, the New York salary seems more attractive. But after correcting for cost of living, taxes, and housing costs, Texas comes out ahead. New Yorkers pay the highest tax burden in the nation, at nearly 13 percent of their annual income, while Texans pay about 8 percent.
After taxes, New Yorkers rake in an average of $59,800 annually, while Texans take home $46,240. If you live in Manhattan, you pay an average of $35,340 each year for a one bedroom apartment. In Austin, one of the highest cost of living cities in Texas, the same apartment will run you $17,200, plus more square footage. Minus taxes and housing, you take home $24,460 a year in Manhattan and $29,040 a year in Austin.
Accounting for the cost of goods, Texas wins even further. The actual value of $99 your $100 brings you in Austin compared to the $82 in Manhattan means that your true adjusted take home pay is about $28,900 in the Lone Star State capital and exactly $20,000 in the Big Apple. Even with the higher income in Manhattan, moving to Austin means picking up nearly a 45 percent increase in you discretionary income.
For young people just entering into their careers, experienced workers reaching their prime earning years, and older retirees alike, the results are the same across the board. Living in red states usually means that you not only have a better chance to get and keep a job or run a business, but the money you earn will go much further. This is, in large part, why people are fleeing San Francisco, where houses worth $1 million are described as “rundown shacks,” and why New York is losing some 270 residents each day, more than any other city in the United States.
Pandemic reveals flaws of unemployment insurance programs
Still, the poster children for progressive policies are doubling down. In New York, an increased state tax on the sale of homes that are worth more than $1 million, not uncommon in Manhattan, caused an actual drop in real estate sales in the city by up to 16 percent. California passed state rent controls last month, which will bring predictable results.
Poor policy decisions in blue states result in housing supply restrictions, overregulation of business, and taxes and fees galore. The accumulated policies in these laboratories of democracy show the true growth and opportunities for families are in those regions that have recognized you can only ignore the laws of economics for so long.

0,10/18/19 02:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/466454-boris-johnson-cannot-afford-defeat-on-the-new-brexit-deal-with-europe,Boris Johnson cannot afford defeat on the new Brexit deal with Europe,"There was an inescapable sense of déjà vu in Brussels this week as European Union leaders fleshed out the details of a new withdrawal agreement on the long delayed British exit from the largest trading bloc in the world. Is it a good deal and better deal or a worse deal? An answer to this question largely depends on where one sits in the great Brexit debate. Essentially, the new deal is only an ever so slightly repackaged version of the withdrawal agreement painstakingly negotiated by the government of Therea May, that same agreement Boris Johnson and his allies, most of whom are now in his cabinet, vehemently rejected months ago.
Yet there are some crucial differences especially relating to Northern Ireland and the diverging trading relationship within the United Kingdom after Britain leaves. The new agreement avoids a hard physical border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, crucially leaving the latter aligned to European Union single market rules for certain goods while at the same time remaining part of the United Kingdom customs territory. The Northern Ireland Assembly would then vote on whether to maintain that European Union relationship going forward by a simple majority and thereby keeping Northern Ireland as the only part of the United Kingdom in two regulatory systems. The Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party, which has been propping up the conservative government for two years, has rejected the latest deal with the European Union.
The changes negotiated by Johnson to the Northern Ireland part of the deal are major concessions from the man who one year ago staunchly rejected. Indeed, Johnson, speaking at the Democratic Unionist Party annual conference last year argued that the deal under May would result in Northern Ireland becoming a “semi-colony of the European Union” and would be damaging “with regulatory checks and even customs controls between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on top of those extra regulatory checks down the Irish Sea that are already envisaged in the withdrawal agreement.” He exclaimed, “No British conservative government could or should sign up to any such arrangement.”
The deal under Johnson goes further than what May had previously agreed to. In his latest version, a customs border will exist down the Irish Sea, effectively cutting Northern Ireland off from the rest of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland will then, bizarrely, be part of two customs arrangements, that of the European Union and the United Kingdom, which despite the obvious additional administrative complexity that this gives rise to, may well provide the region with a major economic boost to companies wishing to have a foot in both customs regimes.
Nevertheless, the agreement, if passed, will lead to the birth of an asymmetrical customs system from the outset between England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Unsurprisingly, Scottish nationalists who have long pushed for the whole of the United Kingdom to remain within the European Union customs market, are fuming at what they view as preferential treatment for one part of the United Kingdom.
The question left unanswered after the European Union approved the text of the deal is whether Johnson has the numbers in Parliament to seal the deal. Having inherited a minority administration from May, Johnson expelled 21 members from the party in early September after they voted with the opposition to pass legislation forcing the prime minister to legally ask the European Union for an extension should no deal be agreed by October 31, the official deadline for leaving the European Union.
Luckily for Johnson, the majority of these 21 party exiles are likely to support the deal during the House of Commons vote this weekend. The two dozen or so hardline members of Parliament on the right of the party, collectively called the European Research Group, who frequently voted down the deal under May and attacked her negotiating position, are also likely to toe the party line and vote in favor of the new agreement.
For many in the European Research Group, accepting the repackaged deal under Johnson is far better than being responsible for a defeat which could potentially lead to a second referendum on whether to accept the agreement or remain in the European Union. Ironically, most of these diehard Brexiters have stressed that they would only back a withdrawal agreement that had the support of the Democratic Unionist Party. Yet assuming Johnson can whip his party into joining the government in support of the deal, he still falls short of a majority in Parliament.

The 10 members at Westminster have not only rejected the agreement, they will vote against it leaving the prime minister in a familiar position faced by his predecessor, short of a House of Commons majority. But Brexit fatigue might well sway a number of rebel members from the opposition Labour Party to break party ranks and support Johnson simply to get a deal approved and move on from an issue that has paralyzed British politics for three years. Just exactly how many members of Parliament will cross the aisle is the great unknown with many of the undecideds deciding which way to vote at the last moment. However even the most optimistic forecasters still conclude that the new deal will be defeated by a number of votes barring some miracle.
Will Britain finally leave the European Union on October 31? It is highly unlikely if this new deal under Johnson suffers the same fate as the deal under May. For the prime minister who famously said he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than ask the European Union for an extension, a defeat in the House of Commons will almost certainly mean an embarrassing climbdown and a lengthy extension of negotiations into 2020.

0,10/17/19 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/466376-the-state-of-the-global-economy,The state of the global economy,"Some American economy watchers worry openly about the prospect of a recession at home in the United States. At the same time, some global economy watchers, such as those about to gather for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington this week, have been just as worried about a recession across the world.
This should be no surprise even to those who focus heavily on the United States. For months, the Federal Reserve has expressed open anxiety about potential weakness here, but has identified the trade war and economic weakness overseas as the causes of its worries. The Chinese economy has been in a soft fall for years, weighing on global growth.
Beyond the economic shakiness that was already in place just about everywhere, the trade war induced by the United States has been dragging down pretty much all activity around the globe. As a result of the conflict, the American economy is hurting, the Chinese economy is hurting, and when the two largest economies in the world are sneezing, there is a good chance that everyone will catch a cold.
But what is a global recession? An American recession is officially called by an institution known as the Business Cycle Dating Committee, which is organized by the National Bureau of Economic Research. It considers a wide range of indicators, including but not limited to the gross domestic product adjusted for inflation. The shorthand definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of absolute decline of gross domestic product, however, that has never been the official criterion.
There is no official arbiter of a global recession. For that matter, the world gross domestic product has no official publisher, but it is estimated by several observers. Given the large number and the diversity of the nations, an actual decline in world gross domestic product would be extraordinary. There are usually enough nations growing to keep the global average above zero. In recent decades, only the global financial crisis saw an absolute decline in world output. As a rule of thumb, without definitive data, a global recession is widely considered to be a period of growth in world gross domestic product less than 2 percent at an annual rate.
Where do we stand? World gross domestic product is growing slightly above 2 percent, and we are flirting with a global recession. But my forecasting colleagues believe the world economy is bottoming out. They have several reasons for optimism. The global Consumer Confidence Index may be the most important indicator. The corresponding measure of business executives, dealing directly with the trade war and its rising tariffs and prices, is rather dour. But historically, when consumers are optimistic and willing to spend, even frowning business executives cannot stand in their way, and right now, global consumers are ready to buy.
The German economy, which is the anchor of Europe, had been quite soft. But growth indicators suggest that Germany has hit bottom and is bouncing back. The American economy has enjoyed strong job creation numbers, which makes it hard to imagine an outright economic downturn anytime soon. China is hobbled by the trade war, but it continues to grow. Comparative weakness in Latin America is fully offset by strength in the more developed parts of the world, which is pretty much the opposite of the usual pattern, under which developing countries grow faster.

This takes us to the United Kingdom. Some would say that the country is already in a recession, making it one of the weights on a global economy that seems to have the strength, on balance, to just keep its head above water. Prolonged uncertainty and fear of the United Kingdom crashing out of the European Union in a hard Brexit weigh on the global economy. If rumors of movement toward a settlement should be borne out, the global economy should be ready to begin an upswing from short of the 2 percent growth barrier that generally denotes a recession. That would indeed be good news for both businesses and consumers everywhere.
Despite some bad luck and some policymaking wounds across the major players, the leaders of the global economy can gather with at least some collective optimism. A recession can be avoided, and growth can resume, especially if conflicts over Brexit and trade can be resolved.

0,10/15/19 12:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/465853-a-democrat-and-a-republican-ask-can-we-be-friends-again,"A Democrat and a Republican ask, 'Can we be friends again?'","We are political adversaries of a sort. One of us chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, while the other chaired the National Republican Campaign Committee. We differ on impeachment. We are not naive enough to believe there is any way of reconciling our opinions on these issues. We do, however, share this common concern.
No matter where the process leads, it will further polarize America. This means both sides must find ways to hold their respective opinions without losing common ground. It may sound like a platitude, but it is not. In all our years in the political arena, we have not seen the level of derision and divisiveness that we see today. If you are a Democrat you probably blame Republicans. If you are a Republican, you probably blame Democrats. If you are an independent, you parcel blame to both parties.
Those perceptions may ebb and flow, but they run deep. We have heard the stories of battle lines and “disarmament zones” designated at family dinner tables, and of friendships ended over political loyalties. Assuming the impeachment process continues, these divisions may grow even sharper and deeper. This leads to an important question. Can people on opposite ends of ideology and world views maintain friendships?
One of the lessons learned in politics is that Democrats and Republicans will disagree 80 percent of the time. That is baked into the proverbial cake. There is a reason we pick our political parties. They are structures and networks that nurture our individual belief systems. Instead of beating each other up on 80 percent of issues where we will never agree, we must focus on the 20 percent where consensus is possible.
Take, for example, Democrat Barbara Lee and Republican French Hill. You could not possibly find two members of Congress further apart on ideology. But they have joined together to introduce legislation to restore federal Pell Grants for incarcerated people. Or take Republican Peter King, a staunch supporter of President Trump
, and Democrat Carolyn Maloney, one of his most outspoken critics. The two New York lawmakers set ideology aside to pass a bill providing permanent health benefits to workers who responded to 9/11. President Trump signed the law.
There are numerous other examples. The Stopping Bad Robocalls Act included the likes of progressive Ro Khanna and conservative Billy Long. Nine members from the left to the right from Anna Eschoo to Brett Guthrie cosponsored the Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act introduced by Debbie Dingell, which President Trump signed. When Democrat John Lewis introduced the Taxpayer First Act, which focuses on cybersecurity and protecting taxpayers from identity theft, his cosponsors included Republican Kevin Brady and Democrat Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.
We even saw ideological opposites come together two Sundays ago, when Ellen DeGeneres and former President Bush accompanied each other to a football game between the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys. There is certainly space on Capitol Hill for finding common ground among political combatants. It may be small and narrow, and the ceasefires may be short and limited. But in a divided environment like the one we are in today, they can make a significant difference.

Most members of Congress have come to regard their primary elections as their major obstacle to reelection. They spend their time, spin their rhetoric, and focus their votes on catering to primary voters, a thin ideological slice of the electoral pie. But winning is not everything. The damage to the institution that uncontained and elevated conflict brings cannot be easily undone. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill indeed have a great opportunity to set an example for the country to follow.
If political combatants can find even modest opportunities to focus on shared concerns, we all can. All it takes is understanding the reality that we will disagree fundamentally on most issues, however, that does not foreclose agreement on some issues. Except for the Nationals and the Mets. On that, there is no room for compromise by either of us.

0,10/06/19 02:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/463753-pulling-out-of-polarization,Pulling out of polarization,"Polarized politics is a formula for public failure, a downward spiral of distrust and greater paralysis. Pulling out of this spiral is difficult because polarization is good business for politicians and pundits. Political coffers fill up with contributions from people who loathe the other side. President Trump
has a unique genius for sowing division — playing to people’s fears and attacking the weaknesses of his opponents. Social media fans the flames of the latest outrage.
Some think the cure to polarization is more moderate politicians. By fixing electoral machinery that appears to favor extremists, such as gerrymandering and restricted primaries, reformers hope to return to the happy days when leaders from both parties could sit down and work things out.  They long for Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill.
Moderation is just happy talk, however, without a new vision of how to govern better. How would moderate leaders fix schools, or reduce health care costs, or issue permits within a year’s time instead of a decade? None of the candidates in the 2020 presidential election offers a cure to the alienation that Americans feel towards Washington.   
Washington, meanwhile, plows forward, a giant bureaucratic state crammed with red tape and obsolete programs. Democracy has degenerated into a kind of legal perpetual-motion machine, taking upwards of a decade to approve vital infrastructure projects. Bureaucracy is everywhere.  According to the World Bank, the U.S. ranks 53rd in ease of starting a business. Practical choices throughout society are stymied by overbearing law — whether maintaining order in the classroom, being candid with an employee, or letting children walk to school alone. Is your paperwork in order?
Reformers have confused cause and effect: Paralyzed government, not polarization, is the original sin of modern government. Bureaucratic densification since the 1970s has made government beyond human control. Government’s inability to respond to public needs is the chicken that laid the egg of polarized politics. The inability of Americans to roll up their sleeves and fix things leads inexorably to extremism. Political leaders who can’t get things done compete instead by pointing fingers and screaming louder.   
Populism thrives on fear and anxiety. A collective sense of powerlessness spawns the instinct to vilify “the other.” Government is toothless to deal with dislocations of global commerce, new technology and waves of immigrants. Self-reliance is stymied by faceless bureaucracy. Unresponsive government prompts anxious citizens to embrace populist solutions.
In 1939, the organizational expert Peter Drucker wrote that fascism had taken root because the establishment had offered “no new order” to counteract the dislocation of the Great Depression.  But fascism was doomed to fail, Drucker argued, because its popularity was based on attacking scapegoats, not a positive governing vision. The solution to a destabilized society in which people feel powerless, Drucker argued, must be “built upon a concept of the nature of man and of his function and place in society.”  People must be able to help themselves and their society.   
The way out of America’s downward spiral is not moderation but a radical spring-cleaning of government to re-empower Americans at every level of responsibility. Liberating people to act, not top-down solutions, is the cure to paralysis.
The only cure to alienation is ownership. This requires not wholesale de-regulation, but rebooting government with simpler, open frameworks that set goals and governing principles.  Simpler codes will allow Americans to understand what is expected of them and afford them flexibility to get there in their own ways. Only then will officials and citizens have the freedom to make sense of daily choices.  
Action, not moderation, is the salve for polarization. Conventional wisdom is that letting individuals use their judgment will exacerbate social conflict. Evidence suggests the opposite: A study in Britain found that professionals with opposed ideological views generally arrive at similar solutions when confronting concrete problems. Studies of American judges and of German bank regulators also found remarkable consistency.

Unemployment debate sparks GOP divisions
Local communities must be able to run schools in their own ways. Health care providers must be accountable for overall quality, not to compliance police playing “gotcha.” Officials must be empowered to set up and give permits in “one-stop shops.” Governors must have freedom to try new ways to manage unemployment relief and other public services. Citizens must have someone to call, and to blame, when things aren’t working.    
Reviving human responsibility does not solve societal challenges such as income stagnation, climate change, or immigration. But it reinvigorates a culture of practical action that is the antidote to corrosive polarization. Empowering people to be practical in their daily challenges will likely rub off in their political views. Polarization will fade away when Americans, waking up each morning, feel that both they and their officials in Washington can make a difference again.

Prioritize democracy assistance,"The United States is reshaping how it uses foreign aid in order to compete with China. The executive branch and Congress are exploring efforts — some controversial and still few on details — to better leverage foreign aid as a tool to prevail in an era of great power competition.
This competition is one over resources, influence and nothing short of the world order’s future contours — or, as the 2017 National Security Strategy aptly proclaims, “between those who value human dignity and freedom and those who oppress individuals and enforce uniformity.” 
The strength of democracy in places where the United States and China are competing will be a key determinant of the competition’s result. Authoritarian countries are more vulnerable to Beijing’s coercion or cooptation because their regimes are less constrained by independent media, free elections, and other institutional checks that would otherwise control against such subversion. The numbers are not in America’s favor. Over the last decade, democracy has declined globally while the ranks of authoritarian states have swelled.
Recent research from the International Republican Institute confirms that China is exploiting — and exacerbating — democratic weaknesses in target states to advance its interests. This includes signing opaque deals through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that saddle countries with debt and invite massive corruption. 
Further, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regularly coopts local civic groups or journalists to stymie negative portrayals of its engagement and thereby protect growing investments and ties to corrupt elites in target countries. At a macro level, China is projecting its authoritarian model as a viable alternative to the West’s liberal democratic variant. 
If left unchecked, the potential cost of these Chinese initiatives to U.S. interests is clear: increased instability in regions where democracy is decaying, more countries in Beijing’s grip and less inclined to align with America, and an illiberal Chinese sphere of influence. 
Regardless of the final contours of policy changes under consideration, it is clear that the United States should make democracy assistance a central component of its strategy for prevailing against China. This should involve using foreign aid to help make countries more resilient to CCP coercion and, hand in hand with diplomacy, champion the superiority of U.S. liberal democracy to China’s authoritarian option. 
To chart this path forward, the United States can look to the past for effective democracy assistance approaches.  
Two examples stand out:  
First, from Ukraine to Zimbabwe, U.S. foreign aid programs have strengthened the capacity of civil society actors to uncover corruption, increase transparency and hold leaders accountable. Similar programs could serve as a check against China’s malign influence if the United States deploys them in countries vulnerable to CCP coercion. It must tailor support to equip recipients with the resources necessary to uncover and publicize opaque deals between their leaders and Beijing. 
Second, U.S.-funded trainings can enhance foreign journalists’ understanding of critical journalism skills and inculcate a belief in them that reporters play a critical watchdog role in society. If the United States expands and targets these programs in countries vulnerable to Chinese coercion, they could help increase transparency as a check against opaque BRI deals and the associated expansion of CCP influence.
Our competitor clearly sees the benefit of this type of initiative. China is expanding the trainings or free graduate programs in communications it offers to media professionals where participants learn about the Chinese model of “constructive” journalism, which is antithetical to independent media, and Beijing’s governance model. 
The United States has used initiatives such as journalist and civil society trainings to help countries thwart corruption and shore up their democratic institutions. In Africa, for instance, the International Republican Institute has provided civil society actors and journalists with the knowledge and skills to provide oversight of budget processes.

Programs such as this support countries’ capacity to practice sound, transparent, and responsive governance and financial management — and to rebuff foreign investment that comes with opaque strings attached. Like the citizen diplomacy exchange programs the United States supports, these initiatives also demonstrate the strengths of participatory governance and how it is superior to China’s authoritarian approach. Spending foreign aid on these ventures is critical at a time when China is ramping up its own efforts to train the next generation of developing country officials on the CCP’s authoritarian approach to governance.
Supporting democracy abroad is not only essential to winning the competition with Beijing. It also has strong domestic support. Seventy-one percent of Americans favor the U.S. “taking steps to support democracy and human rights in other countries,” according to a 2018 survey. The United States need not reverse democratic deficits in all nations vulnerable to CCP coercion, but shoring up critical governance gaps in priority countries will complicate Beijing’s efforts to expand its influence and undermine U.S. interests around the globe.

0,09/30/19 02:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/463669-how-to-fix-political-dysfunction,How to fix political dysfunction,"Congress has once again kicked the can on its basic responsibility of appropriating money to operate the government. It is another link in a long chain of failures to find some compromise and give agencies and businesses some certainty around which to plan. This game costs all taxpayers enormous amounts of money and is just slightly less bad than closing the government. It is sad that temporarily avoiding an imminent shutdown is considered a success. No wonder 80 percent of Americans say Congress is dysfunctional. That is an unhealthy crisis of public faith.
Gridlock has made it nearly impossible to deal effectively with budgetary issues. The government ran out of funds three times last year and began the longest shutdown in our history. Continuing resolutions, which place federal spending on autopilot using numbers from the previous year, have become ever more prevalent, increasing in length by 200 percent in the last decade. Congress is in a fiscal death spiral, and partisan dysfunction is to blame. Here are three modest ideas to help lift us out of this mess.
First, end shutdowns and continuing resolutions forever. Members of Congress need to be incentivized to finish the budget cycle on time before the end of the fiscal year. Yet they are strongly incentivized to not compromise thanks to our electoral system of gerrymandered districts, closed primaries, and winner take all duopolies. To counter this, provide an urgent message that all politicians in office will understand and restrict members of Congress from collecting campaign contributions until they can complete the budget and appropriations cycle for the fiscal year.
If members want to get about raising money for reelection, they will get the budget process done quickly. With this rule, continuing resolutions and shutdowns will be things of the past, and appropriations will probably be done before summer. This approach has the added benefit of showing citizens that Congress will take a break from the money game while they are doing the important business of allocating taxpayer funds. Members will also probably enjoy the respite from hectic call times as well.
Second, address the poisonous partisan media environment. Our friends in the free press play a vitally important role in informing the public and keeping politicians honest. However, their relentless pursuit of dramatic narratives where one side is pitted against the other simply serves to deepen mistrust. This problem is hard to address with legislation. Instead, perhaps news outlets could be called upon to voluntarily help citizens gain better context about what elected leaders say on television.
How about displaying on screen the partisan voting index of every representative who is interviewed so viewers can see how partisan their district is? We know there is a correlation between this score and how incentivized they are to use combative partisan language, so help viewers understand what motivates a representative. This proposal will require a little viewer education, but that might help us all be better citizens.
Third, mandate voting. Elections should be a contest of ideas pitched to a wide audience of citizens, not competitions to turn out an ever dwindling crowd of fringe participants. That leads to tremendously outsize power for political extremists, which is a reason why legislative debate often looks like a meeting of two opposing crowds who scheduled rallies at the same time. One solution to increase participation is to mandate voting. If we encourage universal voter turnout, we will rebalance the electorate to include many more voters who demand compromise over ideology.

Unemployment debate sparks GOP divisions
Congress could somehow link federal benefits to citizens participating in elections. This of course must be accompanied by improvements in ease of voting. Congress and state governments must invest in greater access to absentee and mail in ballots so that no one has to wait in a long line to vote. Other countries, such as Australia, mandate voting as part of their civic life. It not only increases turnout but removes the tempting option of disaffected voters checking out of their civic duty to engage in choosing leaders, an option that just tends to make things worse for everyone.
The United States government has become dysfunctional to the point that gridlock is almost a cliche. But it is not hopeless. Our political system is well designed, assuming informed voters participating broadly. It is high time to reverse the damaging cycle, incentivize elected leaders to find basic compromise, and restore public faith in our great democracy.

0,09/27/19 04:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/463424-why-president-trump-will-enjoy-success-with-hispanics-in-2020,Why President Trump will enjoy success with Hispanics in 2020,"A Census Bureau report released this month reiterates what we already know, which is that Hispanics have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the economy under Donald Trump
. Both the president and Republicans in Congress should leverage this critical Hispanic economic success to maximize their chances of winning in the election next year.
Census data reveals Hispanic median income reached a record high in 2018. The poverty rate for Hispanics fell to a record low of 17.6 percent. The poverty rate among Hispanic women households with no spouse present fell by 4.0 points and by 7.1 points for their children.
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that Hispanic wages grew by a healthy 3.3 percent over the last year, while the Hispanic unemployment rate currently stands at another record low of 4.2 percent. According to the nonpartisan organization known as the Latino Donor Collaborative, Latinos are the “new face” of the American workforce, comprising about 70 percent of the recent surge in growth.
Good jobs are being created. Part time jobs, often retail positions staffed by Hispanics, are declining, while full time jobs are expanding. There are 7.2 million unfilled jobs across the country, many of which pay $50,000 a year or more yet do not require a college degree. According to the latest Kauffman Foundation entrepreneurship report, Hispanics are nearly twice as likely to start their own businesses than whites are.
Hispanics are cashing in on their economic success by achieving the American dream of home ownership. Though they make up just one-fifth of the national population, Hispanics made up nearly two-thirds of the net home ownership gains in 2018. Can Republicans turn this economic success into Hispanic votes next year? Doing so could be the key to holding Senate seats in Arizona and Colorado, as well as repeating a Trump victory in Florida. The Hispanic shares of these state populations are 32 percent, 22 percent, and 26 percent, respectively.
According to recent polling by Unidos, the most important issue for Hispanics is jobs and the economy. While 37 percent of respondents said that they had voted for Republicans in the past, Republicans received only 29 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2018, about the same as what Trump and Mitt Romney received in 2016 and 2012. To expand their Hispanic support above the one-third threshold, Republicans should contrast their economic record with the socialist agenda of Democrats.
The “Medicare for All” and “Green New Deal” proposals, for example, would take roughly $32 trillion and $70 trillion out of the private sector, reducing economic opportunity for ordinary Americans. The massive tax increases needed to fund these socialist initiatives would suck private capital out of communities across the country, funds that are now being invested in good jobs and wage increases. Hispanics are at the front lines of the economy and would be the first casualties in a return to stagnant growth under the stifling regulation that Democrats favor.

Republicans should also get an assist in their Hispanic outreach efforts from the increasingly radical social policies proposed by Democrats. Hispanics are the most religious demographic in the country, with about five in six Hispanics identifying as Christian. That means Democratic support of late term abortions and progressive gender theories will turn off at least some potential Hispanic voters in the election.
Democrats recognize they are vulnerable on the issue of the economy. They are doing everything in their power to play down the success of Trump by pretending the economy is not working for ordinary people and minorities. This approach may backfire. As Hispanics continue to flourish, they could see Democrats not only as a threat to their economic success, but also as political demagogues who are out of touch with reality. Republicans should make this case in their campaigns.

0,09/24/19 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/462873-senate-confirmation-drama-highlights-media-hypocrisy,Senate confirmation drama highlights media hypocrisy,"The national news headlines all too often blast President Trump
and Republicans for supposedly eroding civic norms, yet Democrats get a free pass from mainstream journalists for their biased shortcomings that frays trust in government and ultimately trust in the media itself.
The latest case in point is the silence surrounding Democratic Senator Robert Menendez
, who was severely admonished at age 64 by the Senate Ethics Committee for serious ethics violations tied to a federal corruption indictment, blocking former Republican Representative Darrell Issa
from serving as the next director of the Trade and Development Agency, allegedly because Issa used fake identification at age 17.
The lack of media outrage over the intransigence of Menendez against Issa, who is a successful entrepreneur with significant strengths that he can bring to the trade development role on behalf of the American people, is fitting with repeated and vitriolic personal attacks by both reporters and pundits alike, against not only President Trump, but those who serve the public in his administration. This damages the interests of all citizens in the name of media obstruction by liberals.
As a sitting senator, Menendez was admonished by all six members of the Senate Ethics Committee for accepting expensive gifts and travel from Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor who was eventually convicted of defrauding Medicare by $73 million and sentenced to 17 years in federal prison. The indictment against Menendez stated that he allegedly intervened on behalf of Melgen with Medicare billing, pressured federal officials about a $500 million port security contract between a company owned by Melgen and the Dominican Republic, and helped secure visas for girlfriends of Melgen. Menendez was also investigated for allegedly paying for underage prostitutes while in the Dominican Republic.
In stark contrast, Issa, now age 65, as a teenager used fake identification at age 17 so that he could enter bars and drink. Since then, Issa as an adult has received multiple government security clearances, including while serving in the United States Army and as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in Congress. Issa also cofounded a successful multimillion dollar car security business.
The sins of these two men could not be further apart, yet mainstream journalists attack Republicans as inept, while Democrats like Menendez obliterate civic norms by stalling Republican nominees at rates that far surpass his predecessors. It is no wonder the Trump administration has expressed concerns that Democrats are “weaponizing” Senate cloture.

The media hypocrisy would be astounding if it were not already so normalized by a national press corps with entrenched bias against conservatives and Republicans. The lack of media accountability for the way Menedez has behaved with Issa is the latest example of press bias against conservatives. This was highlighted in a Pew Research Center report this year that found 73 percent of Republicans believe that the national media does not understand “people like them.” Another Pew Research Center report found that most Americans continue to believe that the national media “favor one side” on political and social issues.
Journalists often express outrage and fear over the anger and frustration that President Trump and his supporters express against the media, yet they rarely consider their own behavior. A Monmouth University poll last year found 77 percent of Americans believe the media report fake news. Even more telling is that 65 percent said fake news includes how outlets make editorial decisions on what they cover. The case of Menendez and Issa is another example of biased media priorities favoring liberal ideology over an administration hired by voters to fight for their interests.

0,09/21/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/462445-ukraine-could-badly-damage-both-donald-trump-and-the-democrats,Ukraine could badly damage both Donald Trump and the Democrats,"“One of the biggest political scandals in history” and “bigger than Watergate.” Those were the words that Donald Trump used to describe allegations that an American president used his office to investigate the expected nominee of the opposing political party in 2016.
Of course, three years ago, it was the investigation of Trump campaign associates for alleged foreign business deals and Russian influence. Now, President Trump
faces the same condemnation for allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden
and his son Hunter Biden, a request made when the United States was deciding whether to give $250 million in military aid to Ukraine.
Scandals involving everything from paying off strippers to self-dealing have swirled around Trump for three years. I have challenged many of these allegations, given obvious defenses that would make prosecution or impeachment difficult. The latest scandal, however, could prove more damaging not just to Trump but to the Democrats.
First, to state the obvious, if the president used his office to force another country to investigate a political opponent, it is just as serious as Trump previously described. That is why it was important to investigate the Obama administration allegedly targeting Trump associates, while also supporting the special counsel investigation of Trump.
This latest allegation could be the basis for an impeachable offense as an abuse of power, as was done in the second article of impeachment against President Nixon. Yet much has to be established and, as usual, many in the political arena are dispensing with the need to see actual evidence, as in former secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro
already declaring Trump a “criminal” and demanding that he “be impeached immediately.”
In the most recent disclosures published by the Wall Street Journal, Trump is accused of pressing the Ukrainian president eight times to work with his attorney Rudy Giuliani
to investigate Biden. There is no allegation of an express promise of money in exchange for such an investigation. Such a quid pro quo could be the basis for a criminal charge, but the current allegations are short of the “quid” in the “pro quo.”
While one could legitimately say that an express promise was hardly necessary, with a quarter of a billion dollars on the table, it still is not a crime for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate crimes in another country. Trump can claim that the Biden controversy related to his own belief that Obama and Clinton associates used foreign interests to influence the 2016 presidential election. The greater problem will be obtaining the evidence to show a criminal or impeachable offense.
While the inspector general concluded that this allegation fell within the whistleblower law, the Justice Department has a good faith basis to reject his interpretation. That law is intended to address mismanagement, waste, abuse or a danger to public safety by intelligence officials. The president is the ultimate intelligence authority, and there is little support to argue that a discussion between world leaders should be viewed as a subject of this law. After all, any intelligence official could claim that a president undermined national interests in discussions with another world leader. Trump has been denounced, perhaps correctly, for disclosing classified information to foreign figures, but he has total authority to declassify information for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all.
Even if the law is viewed as covering these allegations, there would be a massive potential court fight over executive privilege. A conversation between two presidents is the ultimate example of a privileged communication. Indeed, the first assertion of executive privilege by George Washington concerned foreign relations communications underlying the Jay Treaty. Executive privilege, however, is not absolute. Indeed, in Richard Nixon versus United States, the Supreme Court rejected the argument of the president after recognizing the privilege.
So where does this leave us? While the claim that such a conversation falls under the whistleblower statute is challengeable, Congress is now formally informed of a serious allegation of abuse of power. It could start to subpoena documents and witnesses, including a transcript of the conversation. Congress should be able to read such a transcript in light of the serious allegations. Ironically, the best hope for Trump remains the Democrats and, specifically, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
.
Ever since before the 2018 midterm election, I have written that the impeachment push was a bait and switch on voters. Democratic leaders never had any actual intent to impeach Trump. They wanted him anemic but alive for the election. However, I noted that the great danger of pretending to want to impeach is that they accidentally stumble into an actual impeachment. Now, they may have stumbled over precisely such an offense while continuing to reassure their voters that, if they only had a clear case, they would move forward aggressively.
It is a nightmare for Pelosi. The only thing worse would be succeeding in such an effort. A removed Trump would leave millions of enraged and energized Trump voters and an undamaged Republican nominee for the 2020 presidential election. To make matters worse, any impeachment proceeding would highlight the dubious business deals of Hunter Biden, reportedly had a penchant for making huge profits in countries where his father was conducting official government business.
This included Hunter accompanying the former vice president on Air Force Two on an official trip to China. Shortly thereafter, Hunter signed a $1 billion private equity deal with a subsidiary of the Bank of China, a deal that was later expanded to $1.5  billion. Hunter also was asked to be a director of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, owned by a government minister and close associate of bloodsoaked former president and Russian stooge Viktor Yanukovych. That is the same Yanukovych represented by disgraced Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort
in his own seedy international business deals.
Conservatives urge Trump to take unilateral action to suspend payroll...

Critics have long pointed to the role Joe Biden played in getting the Ukrainian chief prosecutor fired after he threatened to investigate Burisma Holdings. Biden later bragged that he held up more than $1 billion in loan guarantees and gave the Ukrainians just hours to fire the prosecutor. In fairness to Biden, the United States and many countries were clamoring for Ukraine to act on its rampant corruption, including the need for a more aggressive prosecutor. Yet many experts, even the New York Times, have agreed that the business dealings of Hunter pose a serious conflict of interest for his father. Few people believe the Chinese or Ukrainians embraced Hunter because of his financial brilliance.
Nevertheless, media interest has been remarkably light compared to the interest in Trump family dealings. Democratic leaders have to deal with the misfortune of stumbling upon the very thing they claimed to be desperately seeking. A trial featuring Hunter Biden and windfall business agreements is hardly enticing. That is the problem with playing a shell game with voters. Occasionally, someone turns over the right shell.

0,09/16/19 03:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/461594-latest-brett-kavanaugh-media-report-is-pure-partisan-malice,Latest Brett Kavanaugh media 'report' is pure partisan malice,"Mistakes happen in all fields but in the corridors of elite journalism, certain types of mistakes have become all too common and even predictable. Otherwise fastidious news outlets keep making unthinkable blunders, and their one common denominator is that they always involve attacks against President Trump
or conservatives.
The pattern is clear. An attack on the right target is too alluring for journalists to get bogged down in fairness, fact checking, or decency. The latest New York Times debacle is a prime example of this journalistic phenomenon. Under the title “Brett Kavanaugh
fit in with the privileged kids. She did not,” the paper printed an essay adapted from a forthcoming book on the vicious Kavanaugh confirmation battle.
Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, two New York Times reporters and authors of the essay and the forthcoming book, claim they discovered a new allegation about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh from his college days. The authors write that Max Stier, a classmate of Kavanaugh, witnessed a genitalia in hand incident more than 30 years ago that is eerily similar to what another classmate and accuser, Deborah Ramirez, claimed only “after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney” that Kavanaugh did to her.
The New York Times essay is a thinly disguised screed against Kavanaugh that fails on every level. It is a baseless smear, wrapped entirely in partisan misdirection, topped off with a wildly irresponsible omission of fact. The “new information” about the Ramirez allegations is not really new, and the information about another incident is certainly not fit to be published in anything resembling a reputable paper.
In what may be the most egregious reporting blunder of the Kavanaugh saga, The New York Times issued a correction: “An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book’s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.”
So the woman whom Stier alleges Kavanaugh assaulted with his genitals does not remember the incident, according to her friends. Stier, who was on the defense team for President Clinton during his proven sexual misconduct debacles in the 1990s, does apparently remember the incident. How could this detail, that the victim has no memory of, have been left off the essay? How could any honest observer think that the victim not recalling the incident is anything other than a disqualifier of this obvious smear against Kavanaugh?
But for the broader purpose of the essay, this enormously consequential omission makes perfect sense. What the Times published was always an exercise in narrative creation meant to bolster an ongoing character assassination against a Supreme Court justice that the left believes is a threat to abortion rights. Against that hyperpartisan backdrop, none of the overtly propagandistic editorial decisions in the essay are surprising.
No amount of “new reporting” from partisans on the left can change the basic facts about Kavanaugh. Christine Blasey Ford had so many holes in her Senate testimony that Rachel Mitchell, a career sex crimes prosecutor, found her claims weak, with zero corroboration. Deborah Ramirez apparently remembered a genitals in the face incident from decades ago only after plenty of pressure and assistance from liberals frothing at the mouth to stop the Kavanaugh nomination.

Democrats in Congress, not to be troubled with the facts, are calling for his impeachment. This is, and always was, about bare knuckles partisan politics for them. The ritualized humiliation and torture session of Kavanaugh on national television was unfortunate to Democrats only in that it ultimately was unsuccessful. If they could give it another try, they would, and the liberal activists posing as members of the mainstream media enabled them all along.
Nothing has changed. James Dao, deputy editorial page editor for The New York Times, said in a statement about the Pogrebin and Kelly essay that it was “a well reported and newsworthy account that sheds new light on a matter that provoked significant national debate.” Pravda would be proud. Justice Kavanaugh is a manifestly innocent man. The only debate now is whether The New York Times, among other supposed journalistic enterprises, will make any effort to hold on to their last shreds of professional integrity before the 2020 election.

0,09/13/19 06:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/461365-the-crosshairs-of-extremism,The crosshairs of extremism ,"Not too long ago, I had the honor of hearing Bryan Stevenson, founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, speak about his highly acclaimed book, ""Just Mercy."" If you're not familiar with Stevenson, one of his most notable accomplishments was his initiation of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice; in Montgomery, Ala. — which honors the over 4,000 African-Americans lynched in the twelve states of the South from 1877 to 1950.
It seems only fitting that Stevenson should be talking about this painful part of American history, since, as a nation, we are at a crossroads and in the crosshairs of the kind of country we need to be. One only look at the constant barrage of messages that are unleashed from the Trump administration — from attacks on democratic lawmakers, immigrants to seemingly sexist and demeaning language towards women.
While white supremacy today looks different than it did 150 years ago, but it sounds eerily similar. Just as the evangelical anti-choice movement, white supremacy has long been the projection of social conservative fears about what changes to the traditional family structure will bring. Anti-choice fervor and white supremacy stem from the same place — the idea, need and want to control and preserve a Christian patriarchal order. 
White supremacy and evangelical supremacy have led us to the political crisis we face today. Evangelical Christianity in the United States always has privileged whiteness above all else, to justify the divinely-sanctioned use of bodies of others.
Supremacy in America seemingly views white male bodies as free, and all others as divinely created for a purpose they must fulfill, regardless of their wishes. Those bodies are the ones to be controlled, while male bodies remain free. There is a clear line between racism and anti-choice extremism, and it is the inherent belief that our bodies are not inherently imbued with the same levels of freedom.
The historic institutions founded from these supremacist views have spread that same line of reasoning throughout the centuries, and have become ingrained in our society. Historically, the value of  a woman’s body, a person of color’s body, is not the equal value as a white man’s body. A female body can reproduce and therefore must be regulated, for her to fulfill her “purpose” in the theological sense.
Dr. David Gunn, the first known abortion provider to be murdered for his life's work, was assassinated by a man who had been radicalized by John Burt, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan. My boss and mentor, Dr. Tiller, was murdered by a man who was involved with the anti-government “Christian Patriot movement” group. These same radicals even spurned the extremist anti-choice groups to issue their justification for their murders. Dr. Gunn and Dr. Tiller routinely exposed and discussed the lies of the anti-choice movement.
The crosshairs of white supremacy and male supremacy have long gone unchecked. This ideology was front and center at Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh
’s confirmation hearing when Sen Kamala Harris
(D-Calif.) asked the Supreme Court nominee if he could identify any current laws “that the government has power to make over the male body.” Judge Kavanaugh couldn’t name a single one.
Race and gender are forever encircling each other within the supremacist world view. Access to abortion subverts supremacy by empowering the individual’s hopes, needs, and aspirations, rather than kowtowing to systems of oppression. As a people, we must actively reject white nationalist power in all its forms. 
Trump on coronavirus death toll: 'It is what it is'

Abortion is an act of freedom. Women will not be told what to do, or by whom, but who know themselves and their lives. It is a decision to trust oneself above all others. Though the anti-choice movement has tried to distance itself from its roots of racism, it cannot. Supremacy is supremacy, and we are here to reject notions of superiority.

The result was far from electoral defeat for President Vladimir Putin
and his team. After all, the challengers allowed to run and win are themselves a key feature of the political system put in place over two decades. Nevertheless, the main election result is that Russians are starting to tune out Putin and his message.
The genius of his “managed democracy” was to update for the modern era the likely apocryphal saying of Joseph Stalin on elections that “it is not who votes that counts, but who counts the vote.” Plenty of ballot stuffing continues to take place in Russia during each election. Simply search “Russia ballot box stuffing” on YouTube if you need convincing.
But Putin realized early on that the typical 98 percent election margins of the Soviet era made those leaders a laughing stock abroad and at home. His system, by contrast, is predicated on controlling the candidates allowed to run and on ensuring that a “systemic opposition” would be on the ballot to receive protest votes. Naturally, those systemic opposition candidates would go along with the party in power once in office.
The current party in power, United Russia, is a shell of its former self. All incumbents in the recent Moscow elections from United Russia chose to run as independents rather than with the United Russia label, but the party will only control 25 seats of 50 seats. The systemic opposition parties picked up seats, as the true opposition candidates were barred from voting, a move that triggered large peaceful protests in Moscow over the summer that were met with a violent crackdown by police and prison sentences for select demonstrators. The United Russia setback was not contained to Moscow. The Liberal Democratic Party easily defeated United Russia in Khabarovsk in the far east to bolster its position there.
This might seem like mission accomplished for a managed democracy. United Russia had setbacks, but the systemic opposition served its purpose in swallowing the protest vote. The Moscow Times reports that “acting or incumbent governors in 15 regions and Saint Petersburg received between 56 percent and nearly 90 percent of the votes, with almost all the ballots counted.” Power has not shifted, and the state prevented the true opposition from running and winning a seat.
The reality is not so simple. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, long barred from running himself or placing other candidates on the ballot, came up with a novel tactic. Rather than call for a boycott of the elections, his team built a “smart voting” website and informational campaign asking citizens to choose the candidate in each race most likely to oust a United Russia candidate. Therefore, the results in Moscow are less about an upsurge of support for, say, Communist Party candidates than a clever tactic to help oust as many United Russia incumbents as possible.
The issue is not that the opposition outflanked the state in one election to little practical effect. More serious is the failure of the incumbent system to attract passionate support. Emblematic is the case of the popular Russian rapper Timati, who released a music video for his song “Moscow” that praised the mayor and trashed the protesters. It featured beautiful drone footage of the modern city skyline and landmarks. It also featured a record of nearly 1.5 million dislikes on YouTube before it was deleted.

As it turns out, Putin is a victim of his own success. He and his team sought to build a system that would consolidate control over the entire country and instill in Russian voters a sense of apathy about the possibility of change and cynicism about politics. Russian voters now have both apathy and cynicism in abundance. In years past, this would not have posed a challenge for the authorities. They could count on the opposition to exhaust themselves fighting the bureaucracy and each other.
That script flipped this summer with the “smart voting” campaign. The political energy and passion now resides in the opposition. Navalny spent years revealing corruption with clever videos featuring drone footage of clandestine castles and coastal estates owned by the elite. Clearly, his drones have defeated those of Timati. The state will keep up the pressure. Police forces are raiding the foundation offices of Navalny across the country. But it is uncertain how or whether Putin will get his voters to tune back in after working so hard to convince them to tune out of politics.

0,09/06/19 03:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/460273-mitch-mcconnell-must-get-the-senate-to-secure-our-elections,Mitch McConnell must get the Senate to secure our elections,"According to the Census Bureau, there were approximately 245 million voting age citizens in 2016. Of those, approximately 158 million were registered to vote. The total cost to effectively secure elections in our country is projected to be about $2.15 billion over the next five years. This means the federal government can effectively secure its 2020 presidential election against foreign interference for just $13.67 per registered voter.
In 2018, Congress spent $2.43 per registered voter with $380 million to help states and territories begin to harden their election infrastructure through the Help America Vote Act. It was the first such allocation since 2010. Today, Congress could replace aging election machines and provide enhanced cybersecurity in the voting process for the next four years by appropriating an additional $500 million. That is the good news on this.
The bad news is that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
refuses to allow his chamber to vote on any one of the sensible, often bipartisan, election security bills now dying in the Senate. Bipartisan legislation such as the Deter Act, the Voting System Cybersecurity Act, and the Honest Ads Act, which would require online political ads to provide the same disclosure requirements as political ads on television and other media, languish in committee, each likely destined to fall silently and uselessly off the agenda. These important changes would go beyond merely throwing money at the problem by reforming election security systems to make people, states, and the federal government more resilient to hackers.
To the charge of inaction, McConnell thrusts the Help America Vote Act money as both a sword and a shield. On offense, McConnell says the states have not yet exhausted the $380 million Congress originally allocated. While technically true, that statistic is misleading. In the nonpartisan Election Assistance Commission annual report, it noted the collective “failure” of the states to spend its federal grant money.
It turns out those funds were allocated a mere 77 days prior to the 2018 midterm elections and were used primarily for more staff training rather than for cybersecurity enhancements or new voting machines with paper ballot backups, according to the individually created plans of the states. More importantly, the Election Assistance Commission explained that officials around the country were hoping Congress would consider the $380 million as a “down payment” rather than a “one time solution.”
On defense, McConnell points to the Help America Vote Act money, claiming that any more allocation or federal oversight would infringe on state rights. In other words, he is arguing federalism concerns preclude asserting additional control over the conduct of federal elections by the states. While real in a distant hypothetical sense, these fears are also grossly exaggerated, as each state is permitted to draft its own election security plan, which Help America Vote Act dollars will then fund.
Though McConnell describes the additional costs as prohibitive, in an era in which both the Trump administration and Senate Republicans have embraced $1 trillion annual deficits during an expansionary business cycle, securing elections in our country for about than 0.2 percent of that amount renders any such fiscal argument brazenly disingenuous.

FBI Director Christopher Wray has testified that foreign targeting of election infrastructure to obtain personal information, disrupt elections, and undermine voter confidence is expected next year. Former special counsel Robert Mueller famously testified to his belief that the Russians are actively seeking ways to interfere in the 2020 election “as we sit here.”
In response to such an overt and identifiable threat to our democracy, it is beyond time for Senate Republicans, and most especially McConnell, to protect our most sacred right to confidence in free and fair elections, especially when practical policy solutions exist at reasonable cost.

San Francisco took one step too far,"It is not everyday that a public official uncovers more than five million terrorists living in the United States, including many working in some of the highest offices of the land. Yet, San Francisco District Two Supervisor Catherine Stefani managed to achieve precisely that this week, when the city board of supervisors passed her resolution declaring the National Rifle Association to be a domestic terrorist organization.
For Stefani and other board members, it is not enough to disagree with gun rights advocates. They must be declared terrorists. Otherwise, this would be a mere political disagreement. The San Francisco resolution encourages cities, states, and the federal government to follow suit. It states that NRA terrorism includes spreading “propaganda” and arming “those individuals who would and have committed acts of terrorism.”
The resolution follows a declaration from New York Attorney General Letitia James in launching an investigation of the NRA and declaring that it is not a “charitable organization” but a “terrorist organization.” Of course, the NRA promotes the Second Amendment, which the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed as the basis of an individual constitutional right to bear arms. Thus, San Francisco is declaring that advocacy of a constitutional right is akin to being an arm of the Islamic State.
For her part, Stefani expressed nothing but glee in declaring those on the other side of the gun debate to be terrorists. “The NRA has it coming to them. I will do everything I possibly can to call them out on what they are, which is a domestic terrorist organization,” she said. For the other supervisors, voting against the declaration might have risked being accused of giving material support to a terrorist organization.
The resolution is the very definition of demagoguery. It also is a sign of our time as the perfect resolution for the age of rage. Many people of good faith have criticized the NRA for years, while the organization has opposed many reasonable limits on gun ownership and has painted anyone on the other side as enemies of freedom and liberty.
Yet, it is not uncommon for organizations advocating for individual rights to be “extreme” in their support for that right. NARAL is a pro-choice organization opposing virtually any limit on the right of women to secure abortions, including supporting “partial birth abortion” which most Americans oppose. Environmental groups like Greenpeace oppose most measures that undermine the environment. PETA opposes almost any use of animals, even calling for a robotic “Punxsutawney Phil” groundhog.
Most advocacy groups follow the view of Barry Goldwater that “extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.” Such advocacy is no act of terrorism. In politics these days, however, it is not enough to disagree. You must condemn the very act of speaking or advocating as a virtual crime. That way, you relieve yourself of any responsibility to listen or respond to an opposing view. Many academics and advocates now believe they can stop people from speaking by declaring them to be racists or terrorists.
At the University of California at Santa Barbara, feminist studies associate professor Mireille Miller Young criminally assaulted pro-life advocates on campus, and later pleaded guilty to the crime. She was defended by faculty and students, including many who said she was “triggered” by a pro-life display and that pro-life advocates were “terrorists” who did not deserve free speech. The university refused to suspend or fire her, who has since been celebrated as a leader in feminist activism.
It is now routine for many faculty and students on college campuses across the country to prevent others from speaking by claiming they are acting to stop violent or racist speech. Such declarations are incredibly liberating in that you are no longer confined by notions of free speech.
Indeed, Antifa is dedicated to defeating free speech. Dartmouth University professor Mark Bray, author of a handbook on Antifa, explained, “At the heart of the anti-fascist outlook is a rejection of the classical liberal phrase” that “says I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” He defined anti-fascists as “illiberals” who reject the notion that far right views deserve to “coexist” with opposing views. The goal of Antifa is not to coexist but “to end their politics.”
As someone who has spent a lifetime advocating for free speech, I have long denounced Antifa as a despicable organization. But I was also one of the first to object to President Trump supporting the declaration of Antifa a domestic terrorist organization. That is the problem with free speech. You often have to fight for those who least deserve it, like an organization dedicated to denying it to others. There is no question here that Antifa supporters regularly engage in violent acts, but that does not mean it is a terrorist organization, any more than environmental groups are terrorist organizations when their members engage in such raging acts.
Likewise, many people applauded Democratic candidate and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg after he called for all groups deemed “white nationalist” to be declared domestic terrorists. Columnist Derek Beres explained that “such a label also denies another related idea, manifest destiny, which, like American exceptionalism, states that America has a mandate to change the world. By calling Americans terrorists, we can identify the actual root of racial and nationalist tension on our soil.”
So it is that easy. You simply declare whole groups to be terrorists, and you effectively criminalize their “related ideas.” The counterparts to Stefani in the pro-life community could declare pro-choice organizations to be terrorist organizations that kill the unborn, while Texas could declare vegan advocates to be terrorists for spreading “propaganda” against meat. After all, San Francisco declared five million Americans to be terrorists, so what about the other 322 million citizens in this nation?

The question is what terrorism ultimately means if everyone is declared a terrorist.

O’Brien explains to Winston, “The object of terrorism is terrorism. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?”
Yes, I am beginning to understand. This is all about the object of power.

0,09/03/19 06:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/459743-what-mattis-gets-wrong-alliances-also-need-rebuilding-at-home,What Mattis gets wrong: Alliances also need rebuilding at home,"One of the most respected generals of our time, General James Mattis
, has just finished an autobiography about leadership. In a recent excerpt in the Wall Street Journal, he eloquently describes how his four-decade military career formed his thinking about the importance of international alliances. It’s a well-founded, and well-articulated, point of view. Few will disagree with it, and this and future presidents would be wise to embrace it.
Mattis gets something wrong, though, something important. It’s his attribution of the growing divisiveness in America to tribalism. This misidentifies the nature of the problem. America is of course deeply tribal, and always has been. What we’re living now, though, is political apartheid.
Mattis nails the importance of allies, but it’s not clear that he understands how deeply rooted and inherently tribal the American people are. This likely reflects his personal history. He joined the military at age 19, and worked over 40 years in countries around the world.
I spent 29 years in the Foreign Service, and saw this same phenomenon in many U.S. Foreign Service officers. They were more comfortable overseas than at home, because they were more at home overseas than they were in the United States. Some were second or third-generation military or Foreign Service kids, and had never lived anywhere in America they called home. Others, like Mattis, grew up here but spent their adult lives overseas working on international issues. Virtually all developed a global outlook on U.S. affairs, foreign and domestic.
When I entered the service in 1983, I was astonished at the number of those who had never been west of the Appalachians. Their average age was 30, and they all had stellar resumes. But almost none had travelled the United States, spending time in the small towns, big cities and back roads of America. As a consequence, their understanding of the American cultural landscape was limited. This isn’t a criticism. It goes with the territory, and it’s why Congress long ago made home leave compulsory for Foreign Service officers.
Mattis argues that for American democracy to survive, we must live the motto e pluribus unum—from many, one. But that motto is political, not cultural. Proposed for the great shield of the United States in the 1770s, it alludes not to the patchwork of cultures that made up America, but rather to the relationship between the 13 independent states and the federal government.
This is not, as the diplomats like to say, a distinction without a difference. There is a profound difference between political identity and tribalism. Political identity is inherently political. Tribalism is inherently cultural, and the nature of the human species. Man is, after all, a social primate.
After the end of World War II, and a long period of relative peace and prosperity, our political differences hardened in the late 1960s. Slowly and incrementally, political acrimony deepened in the decades that followed. We learned in the weeks after 9/11 just how far it had gone. As U.S. flags sprouted like poppies across the American landscape, it was clear that politics still stopped at the water’s edge. Attacked at home, national solidarity eclipsed our political divisions.
Since then, the divide has become harder, deeper and more intractable. The Obama and Trump presidencies, both highly partisan, have witnessed an inexorable slide towards what is shaping up as a new kind of civil war in America — not over slavery, economics and state’s rights, but over political identity and ideology. 
CNN political director: President's comments on Lewis 'so shameful'...
America has always been a petri dish of different political views. But as President Lincoln famously said, a nation divided against itself cannot stand. Maybe, as with the Civil War, World War II and 9/11, a great crisis will bring a return to constructive political cohabitation. Maybe the solution is generational change, although evidence appears to the contrary. Maybe, as Henry Kissinger once famously said about Middle East shuttle diplomacy, there is no realistic solution — at least not for now.
It’s not a good time for the nation to be on this trajectory. We have powerful enemies — China comes to mind — which believe that America is in terminal decline, and are actively working to further that process. Mattis’ admonition to strengthen our alliances abroad is sound advice. But alliances also need rebuilding at home, to focus on the political apartheid which divides us. Otherwise, the threat could become existential.

0,09/01/19 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/459592-why-does-new-york-city-lose-more-residents-than-the-rest-of-america,Why does New York City lose more residents than the rest of America?,"New York City is losing more than 270 residents each day, more than any other city in the United States, according to census data analyzed by Bloomberg. Driving these residents away from the Big Apple are high taxes, staggering costs of living, and a significant decline in quality of life. While local politicians watch swaths of people pack up and leave, they continue to prioritize rank partisanship over smart policy. As a result, the great exodus is likely to accelerate in the months and years to come.
New York City is home to the highest tax burden in the country with its residents forking over an average 12.7 percent of their income in state and local taxes annually. The federal tax reform law passed by Congress nearly two years ago drove up middle and upper income tax bills even further by capping state and local tax deductions. For many New Yorkers, this extra cost is the last straw, so instead of coughing up the additional cash, they simply move out to low tax havens in red states like Texas and Florida.
Rather than incentivize high earners to stick around by lowering the state and local tax burden, Governor Andrew Cuomo pushes new taxes and fees to raise funds year after year. He and the state legislature extended the 2009 “temporary” millionaires tax earlier this year, prolonging the policy originally set for sunset in 2012. Unfortunately, much of the increase in revenue is offset by the sheer number of workers fleeing. Cuomo announced a “surprise” $2.3 billion hole in the state budget.
Mayor Bill “Big Tax” de Blasio proudly proclaimed in a recent Democratic presidential debate that he wants to “tax the hell” out of the rich. The impact of his confiscatory tax agenda already imposes burdens on the residents in New York City. He and Cuomo have teamed up to announce new “congestion pricing” in Manhattan, a local internet sales tax, and a cannabis excise tax, hitting low and middle income earners hardest.
The staggering price tag associated with a New York City zip code does not end with taxes. The cost of living in Manhattan is almost 140 percent higher than the national average, making it the most expensive city in the country. Brooklyn and Manhattan rents have reached record highs, with median rent for a one bedroom apartment at nearly $3,000. Building restrictions and rent controls championed by the likes of de Blasio have only made this problem worse. Look no further than the last period of overregulation in New York City, before Rudy Giuliani became mayor, when the rate of new apartment construction was sharply reduced, forcing those not on rent control into much higher monthly payments.
While taxes and costs of living skyrocket, New Yorkers who cannot afford to pay tens of thousands of dollars each year for private schools are also forced to enroll their kids in failing public schools. Some districts are far worse off than others. More than half of public school students in Bronx district nine failed the state math test last year, while only 2 percent of students achieved top tier scores. Of all New York City public schools, more than 120 are “in need of improvement,” according to state officials.
De Blasio has assured constituents that he has found the solution to the public school woes with a push to end all screening procedures that place students in schools based on merit in order to combat racial inequality. The efforts would end programs for gifted students as well as testing to determine enrollment in specialized schools. Such action follows a wave of grade inflation that undermines efforts to increase standards. In one elementary school, 100 percent of students passed their English courses, even though only 7 percent of students at the same school passed the state English exam. Watering down education standards is nothing short of the patronizing and demoralizing soft bigotry of reduced expectations.

Meanwhile, violent crime is back on the rise after decades of historic declines. The local murder rate has ballooned 55 percent higher since last year, while reports of rape also spiked. Surely, it does help that attacks on cops have become common occurrences. All the while, de Blasio and his police commissioner James O’Neill have done little to support their men in uniform. Their agenda has been so catastrophic that the New York Police Department union passed a vote of “no confidence” against de Blasio.
It is easy to see why so many residents are packing up and leaving, but it does not have to be this way. For most of its history, New York City has symbolized power, wealth, and innovation. However, greatness can never be taken for granted. Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg brought the Big Apple back from the brink of its darkest days, but de Blasio and his cadre seem completely determined to kill the goose that laid the golden egg.

0,08/31/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/education/459520-the-twisted-way-educators-are-seeking-diversity-in-education,The twisted way educators are seeking diversity in education,"Democratic presidential candidate and New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio may have a new claim for the campaign trail. He has been challenged to list his accomplishments, particularly after reports came out this week that the number of people leaving New York City has doubled in the last year. However, he might rightfully claim that he wiped out racial disparity in the gifted and talented programs in New York City. De Blasio gave the problem to his school diversity advisory group two years ago, which just came back with a simple solution to eliminate the gifted and talented programs in most schools and poof! You will have racial equality.
Despite more than one million students, the group apparently decided that decades of efforts to achieve diversity in these programs have failed. Black and Latino students make up 65 percent of the kindergarten population of New York City public schools but only 18 percent of the students were offered slots in gifted and talented programs. On the high school level, the disparity is even greater. At the most competitive of its eight elite high schools, only seven of the 895 qualifying students were black. Some 587 were Asian, 194 were white, 45 were unspecified, 33 were Latino, 20 were multiracial, and nine were Native American.
Notably, the termination of the gifted and talented programs would not include those high schools. To most people, such solutions smack of their own form of discrimination. Those white and Asian students still have a great need for such programs, as do those nearly 20 percent of minority students. This achieves equality only by cleaving off the top of academic programs. De Blasio is not alone in achieving inclusion through exclusion. Indeed, even the sight of top intellectuals can prove too much for some.
A few years ago, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow went to Rockefeller University in New York City to bestow an award for women scientists. Maddow apparently saw an alarming sight, a wall covered with alumni winners of the Nobel Prize and the Lasker Award, intellectual giants of science like Francis Peyton Rous, who discovered the role of viruses in the transmission of certain cancers. The problem was that they were all white men, and Maddow reportedly exclaimed, “What is up with the dude wall?”
The “dude wall” is now gone. As Dr. Leslie Vosshall, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, has explained, “100 percent of them are men. It is probably 30 headshots of 30 men. So it is imposing. I think every institution needs to go out into the hallway and ask, what kind of message are we sending?”
For most of us, the obvious message is that these individuals achieved the highest honors in their fields, and the significance is neither their race nor their gender but their intellect. But Vosshall said the sight of so many white men has bothered her for years, and she was part of a committee that removed the portraits. For its part, Rockefeller University insists it did not “remove” but “redesigned” for greater “inclusion.” It claims that there was no more room on the “dude wall,” so it created a photo display allowing for a more inclusive group of winners of various prizes.
Rockefeller University is not alone in this endeavor. Dr. Betsy Nabel, the president of Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard Medical School, decided to sanitize the Bornstein Amphitheater of white men. Nabel declared that all the portraits of the leading figures at Brigham and Women’s Hospital made minority students uncomfortable and ordered their removal. Those portraits included Dr. Harvey Cushing, the father of neurosurgery, and the first chief of pathology, Dr. William Councilman.
At Yale University, Pierson College head Stephen Davis removed all of the portraits of school “masters” because they happened to be white men and declared that the wall would remain blank so that “everyone has a sense of belonging and ownership.” He reversed his decision following a public backlash against this action and insisted that he was misunderstood in his effort to allow a broader dialogue on race and diversity in academia.
There is more to this issue than simple interior decorating. In academia, we honor intellectual advances and measure those without reference to race or gender. All those portraits represent the greatest among us as intellectuals. To see only their race and gender is not just backlash against intellectual achievement but can be itself a form of racial and gender bias. This brings us back to the New York City diversity group. Somewhere in the public school system there is the next Rous or Cushing. The question is whether that child will have a chance to excel without administrators fretting about his or her race or how it looks for the local politicians.
The problem is that highly gifted students need to be able to progress at a faster pace with more challenging material. Otherwise, they can become bored and even regress in their development. For teachers, one of the most difficult challenges is dealing with overcrowded classrooms in which students learn at different paces. The result is often having to teach the majority of the class and leaving those at the top to educate themselves or just drift along. That is why we have gifted and talented programs.

With this change, all students may fare worse. Gifted students are likely to push down the scores and rankings of other students. Currently, students in other programs can still excel and achieve high class rankings to seek college positions. Many emerge, at their own pace, as top students at elite universities. Now, however, these students are likely to find themselves less competitive. Alternatively, some gifted students may simply leave, and calls for vouchers may increase. This will achieve the desegregation interests of the panel by reducing the diversity of the system overall.
Whether it is removing programs or portraits, these efforts are based on a twisted sense of equality. Rather than look at students as individuals with special talents, these educators want to end their programs because of their race. Rather than look at Nobel Prize winners as the geniuses who helped to shape and advance our knowledge of the world, they are seen as irredeemably white or Asian or male. It appears some would prefer a blank wall or an empty building as the ultimate expression of equality.

next year for the Democratic candidates to realize that he is the real enemy and that their continued attacks on each other are diverting the electorate from the most important message that another four years of Trump would take the United States to a place from which it might take decades to recover.
There are differences among the Democratic candidates on issues of importance and on the issues are most important to them, as well as in their levels of experience to be president. But they pale in comparison to the difference for the country if Trump remains president and what it would be like if any one of the Democratic candidates were elected.
Part of this party conflict comes from the media, where the emphasis is in calling out points that separate candidates who are otherwise 95 percent in agreement. Part of the problem rests with supporters, who seem more focused on trying to advance their candidate rather than insisting that they all put forward the kind of strong message against Trump that let Democrats victoriously recapture the House of Representatives in 2018.
To be sure, there are Trump supporters, along with those who hold their noses and vote for him because he lines their pockets with tax reductions and repealed regulations, as well as nominating judges who they expect to respond properly to hot button social issues. There are also millions of independents who need to be reminded of what Trump has done in so many areas, and what he will continue to do unless he is defeated for reelection. Here are just a few of his major vulnerabilities right now.
He has demeaned the presidency by engaging in name calling that is simply out of bounds on most playgrounds. His disparaging of women, minorities, and immigrants is appalling, and his lack of empathy for families devastated by gun violence is incomprehensible, unless you recognize that Trump cares about himself and no one else. Then there is the entire multitude of gross exaggerations and outright falsehoods.
His foreign policy is incoherent as it lacks a set of ideas with diplomacy and goals in mind. It is instead spur of the moment Twitter reactions to current events, generally taken without advice from his officials with far greater experience. The country needs a president who treats our friends as friends and does not bow and scrape before enemies who flatter him.
Health care has been treated as if there was a major divide among the Democratic candidates. But these minor disputes are nothing compared to the differences with Trump, who seeks to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and thereby increase the number of uninsured. Every Democratic candidate wants affordable health care for everyone, although they differ on whether to eliminate all private insurance to achieve that goal. The means matter, but in the end, whatever the president wants, Congress must pass a bill. So much can affect the process that it seems foolish to let reporters and Trump supporters drive wedges within the party.
Climate change is a very complex global problem, except we know that denial is wrong, and every day of inaction makes it more difficult to solve. The Democrats will start by rejoining the critical Paris Agreement and reinstating the environmental regulations the Trump administration has removed, while also following rather than flouting our federal laws.
Immigration is another area where the president has wreaked havoc. We know that building walls, deporting parents who have children born in this country, and denying asylum seekers the opportunity to state their case before a neutral judge will not solve the problem. Whether to eliminate all criminal penalties for illegal border crossings is a debatable idea, but it is not one that should dominate the important discussion on this issue.

On the economy, the Democratic candidates agree that the Republican tax cuts have largely benefitted those with the highest incomes and that the tariffs have hurt many more consumers, businesses, workers, and farmers than they have helped. Their own differences on how to fix the problem of economic inequality pale in comparison to their agreement that the bad policies of the Trump administration need to be reversed.
The list could go on because there is barely any issue on which any of the Democratic candidates agree more with the president than they do with their opponents. For that very reason, all Democrats must explain to the voters why another four years of Trump would be a disaster for the nation instead of why one candidate is better than another on a single issue.

If only they would put aside their genteel political ways, this self-serving theory goes, and do what is necessary instead of what is civil, they would force the American people to finally see the truth of Donald Trump
’s evil.
Columnist Juan Williams (who, it should be noted, does have a reputation for civility) is the latest to propagate this assessment of Democrats as being too fair to their opponents in the Trump era. 
But Mr. Williams is wrong in his diagnosis of how Democrats have approached this president, and even more wrong in his assessment of how Trump’s supporters will respond.  
“Is the resistance finally landing some punches on Trump?” Williams asks. 
Finally? The so-called resistance has been flailing wildly at Trump from Day 1 of his presidency. Not content to make counter-arguments against Trump’s policies, the Democrats have embraced a series of revolting conspiracies and allegations against this president — each one meant to end his presidency, and each rooted in frenzied assumptions or outright denial of objective reality. 
There is never any accountability on the political left for demagogic promises that “Trump’s days are numbered.” The Democrats just move on to the next alleged administration-ending punch. Networks like CNN and MSNBC have conditioned their audiences to believe that Trump’s reign of terror will end any day now for almost three years — and they are either unwilling or unable to walk back those expectations. 
Like clockwork, the media has gone from Russia collusion to obstruction to the 25th Amendment to the “white nationalist” in the White House, and back again. The anti-Trump resistance has even embraced and spread the mania that Donald Trump is a dangerous, Hitlerian figure. And this was in the first year of his presidency. 
Such hysteria is not normal political opposition; it is evidence of a mass psychological malady. 
On the political civility question, Mr. Williams writes in support of Rep. Joaquin Castro
’s (D-Texas) decision to publish a list of San Antonio-based Trump donors who, Castro claimed, were donating money to “fuel hate.” 
Even more than the odious effects on our discourse of “naming and shaming” individual citizens who donate to politicians, the timing of this move was reckless — and intentionally so.  
Castro knew that, in the aftermath of the El Paso shooting, political tensions would be sky-high. For an elected official to disseminate a virtual enemies list of Americans singled out for their legal political donations, within days of a mass murder, is reckless. The San Antonians who donated to Trump had nothing to do with El Paso. Castro should have known better, but the Democratic Party has made everything secondary to bashing Trump. 
Mr. Williams further cites the recent pressure the left put on billionaire SoulCycle owner Steve Ross for his support of Trump as a possible tipping point in the fight for political donations. But this will almost certainly not have the intended financial effect. 
Trump is already building up a formidable war chest for his 2020 reelection effort. He beat Hillary Clinton
in 2016 despite being outspent two-to-one. There has been no shortage of donations to Trump so far, and nobody should expect there will be going forward. 
There is also a central fallacy behind this “Trump is finished” narrative. Despite all evidence to the contrary, the resistance still thinks that they will bludgeon Trump supporters into submission. They fail to realize that Trump’s almost superhuman capacity to endure their scorn, threats and bullying is one of his greatest points of appeal to those who voted for him in 2016.
Trump’s resilience is, in part, a response to a Democratic political culture that refuses to accept the extreme tactics that have been mainstreamed in their own party. 
While the left intones about Trump’s tweets and the need for greater respect in our discourse, most Trump voters see nothing but hypocrisy masquerading as virtue. 
The president’s supporters have not forgotten how Democrats and their media allies engaged in a nationally televised psychological torture session of Judge Brett Kavanaugh
, a manifestly decent and innocent public servant. The left tried to ruin a good man for the most blatant and cynical political reasons. 
The Kavanaugh effect on the conservative psyche remains potent and is one of many reasons that Trump supporters refuse to bend the knee to their liberal tormentors every time the media declares a Trump tweet to be a crisis.

Democrats linking the El Paso shooting to Trump also need to then explain how a Sen. Bernie Sanders

Either we are all only responsible for our own actions, or we can all point fingers when it is politically convenient. 
Fatigue over anti-Trump psychosis is real. If Democrats want to beat Trump, they better do more than hope for a bad economy and call him names.

0,08/20/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/457992-congress-must-rethink-the-debt-limit,Congress must rethink the debt limit,"These days, the only time Congress engages in anything resembling a much needed conversation around the unsustainable fiscal policy of our federal government is when the debt limit approaches and the nation is on the verge of defaulting on its obligations. Trying to determine long term budget policy amidst last minute brinkmanship is foolish in the same way that only showing up at the emergency room is a poor approach to maintaining good health. There is a better way to solve this issue.
The federal government just completed its latest exercise of negotiating a deadline driven deal to overcome the threat of defaulting on our national obligations. The good news is that we made it through. The bad news is that we are already scheduled to be back at it again in two years. If past is precedent, this latest episode will quickly fade in the rearview mirror, and policymakers will go back to ignoring the debt limit until weeks before the next potential calamity in 2021. That would be a grave mistake. Instead, while this issue is fresh, Congress should take the opportunity this fall to take action on a bipartisan basis and chart a more sensible path.
Historically, nearing the debt limit has spurred a discussion about the sustainability of the federal budget. In recent years, however, heightened political polarization has changed the name of the game, with eleventh hour drama as the new normal. This is a horrible way to determine fiscal policy. In fact, rather than tackling the actual problem, the latest budget deal that was negotiated around the debt limit has done just the opposite and resulted in bipartisan agreement to increase the federal deficit.
Even more concerning is that the entire debt limit charade is costly and dangerous. Markets get jittery and demand higher interest rates on federal borrowing each time the issue comes up. While policymakers to date have always averted the crisis, sometimes in the nick of time, the government is routinely one miscalculation away from fiscal disaster.
Some would say the solution is simply to get rid of the debt limit. But since during that charade is the only time we seem to grapple with the $22 trillion national debt, a wholesale repeal of the debt limit statute seems unlikely to be in the political cards. Meanwhile, because the debt limit does not actually provoke a legitimate or productive discussion, debt continues to balloon from unpaid for tax cuts and spending increases. The current road unfortunately has no signs of fiscal responsibility in sight.
The problem is that the debt limit process creates a perverse choice for lawmakers on the one hand to play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States in hopes of extracting a policy concession, or on the other to blindly disregard the urgent problem of mounting debt. A novel approach could help us to make progress on both of these fronts at the same time, taking the risk out of our debt limit exercise while establishing a dedicated process that forces Congress to debate deficit reduction.
If Congress fails to do its job to extend the debt limit well in advance of the deadline, then the president would be given the authority to request such an extension. The action could be disapproved of and thus rejected by Congress, but this would make sure that the important debt limit extension is not reliant on the collective action of 535 individuals.
Restaurant group presses Congress to back off certain PPP changes
Along with that debt limit request, the president would be required to submit a package of debt reduction policies meeting a certain threshold. Those could be tax increases, spending cuts, or some combination of the two. Unlike the White House budget proposal, which Congress has the right to and traditionally does ignore, this package would automatically initiate a process whereby each chamber of Congress ultimately brings to the floor for a vote the White House plan or alternatives worked through the committees. No outcome would be guaranteed, but with issues like taxes, Social Security, or Medicare getting debate and votes, public attention on the issue would certainly and rightly be heightened.
This solution by itself will not solve the skyrocketing debt problem. But it would force a critical debate on debt directed toward a place where we can actually address it, with the determination of how much we spend and how much we raise in revenue, instead of empty threats to walk out when the bill comes due. There is no good reason to continue flirting with disaster on the debt limit and punting our fiscal obligations onto the next generation. This plan is a realistic and constructive solution. Let us not allow partisanship to get in the way of what is right for our economy.

0,08/18/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/457847-joe-biden-faces-an-uncertain-path,Joe Biden faces an uncertain path,"New polling nationally and in early voting states shows the race for the Democratic nomination for president tightening, and possibly even fundamentally changing. Despite the substantive lead that former Vice President Joe Biden
has held in the polls since launching his campaign earlier this year and his above average performance in the second debate, the momentum of his campaign has been gradually slowing down.
On the other hand, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren
has seen her polling numbers surge in the last couple of weeks, and it is clear that she is slowly displacing Senator Bernie Sanders
as the leading candidate of the progressive movement.A recent Monmouth University poll conducted among likely Iowa caucus goers speaks volumes to this trend. While Biden still leads the field with 28 percent support, this is nearly identical to his 27 percent support back in April, when he had not yet even declared his candidacy for president. However, the same poll shows Warren in second place, now at 19 percent support, up from 7 percent support in April.
Warren has now become the progressive candidate to beat among the Democrats, and her gains have resulted in losses for her progressive contenders, namely Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris
. While Biden still leads in polling nationally, it is clear that the energy in the party is not with him, and it is highly unlikely that he will be able to break above his polling position in the high 20s or low 30s. While Warren rises in the polls and the enthusiasm surrounding her campaign are certainly substantive, she still faces persistent doubts, even among her supporters, about whether she would be able to beat President Trump
in the general election.
While her primary campaign has generated excitement, there are legitimate concerns about how her rigid progressivism would fare in swing states, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, that the Democratic candidate needs to secure to win the presidency. Even after Warren won the second debate decisively, a Quinnipiac University poll revealed that she still fell far behind Biden on the question of who has the best chance to beat Trump, as 49 percent of respondents said Biden is the best candidate to beat Trump, compared to 9 percent who said Warren is.
While it is clear that electability is important to Democrats, the majority of whom would say the most important thing is beating Trump in the 2020 election, the energy in the party has moved largely to the progressive wing, which indeed spells bad news for Biden, especially in early voting states. In fact, in a poll conducted last week by Change Research Iowa, Biden actually lags behind Warren among likely Iowa caucus goers, garnering 17 percent of the vote, compared to 28 percent for Warren.
Polling indicates that Biden very well may lose not just in Iowa, but also in the following early primary states of New Hampshire and Nevada, where Warren has also made gains. While not a guarantee, Warren will likely be the favorite in Massachusetts, which she represents in the Senate.

Ultimately, the Biden campaign has not just leveled off, but he is also experiencing a precipitous decline both nationally and in early voting states. His focus would be best directed at early voting states such as South Carolina, where Biden has an opportunity to establish himself with the large African American presence in the primary electorate. A win in South Carolina would demonstrate his strength as a candidate, in comparison to either slim victories or even losses in the prior states.
Simply put, Biden faces a far from certain path to the nomination, and this is growing more uncertain by the day. In the months to come, the battle between the progressive idealists, led by Warren, and the moderate pragmatists, led by Biden, will truly take shape as the voters decide which vision for the Democratic Party will be up against Trump in 2020.

and the Israeli government to bar two members of Congress from visiting the state of Israel. I say this not as a critic of Israel, but as one who loves the country. As a member of Congress, I had a 100 percent voting record on Israel. As a member of the House Democratic leadership, I opposed the Iran deal of President Obama. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I helped lead efforts to fund the critical defense needs of Israel.
Let me be clear, I strongly and unequivocally oppose the views stated by Democratic Representatives Ilhan Omar
of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib
of Michigan on Israel. They are simply wrong, which is why I have already condemned them publicly. However, it is my connection to Israel that leads me to also strongly condemn a decision that will hurt Israel.
First, I have seen directly how the positions on Israel of members of Congress have been shaped and reshaped simply by going there. Walking through the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, standing at a point in Jaffa where on a clear day you can see from one end of the country to the other and come to a new understanding of the importance of strategic depth, visiting a hospital near the border of Syria where Israeli physicians provided lifesaving medical attention to Syrian refugees, and attending sessions of the Knesset where elected Arab members have the same rights as any other member. Being on the ground in Israel is vital to promoting understanding. Denying people from stepping on that ground only serves to fortify their worst perceptions of the country.
Second, contrary to the narrative that support for Israel among the Democratic members of Congress has eroded, it is actually stronger now with the addition of a multitude of freshmen who strongly support the bilateral relationship. There is, however, a long term problem as younger Democratic activists drift away from supporting Israel. By denying two Democratic lawmakers entry to the country, both Trump and the Israeli government have only raised antagonism and opposition and pushed that generation further away. Trump has not only managed to use Israel as a wedge within the American electorate today, he is building a longer lasting wedge between the United States and Israel in the future.

Third, members of Congress have the right to travel, even when we or others around the world may find their views abhorrent. For a sitting president to publicly urge another country to ban democratically elected members of Congress is a further blow to the separation of powers and yet another insult to the democratic process of the United States.
Finally, if the Israeli government decides to ban visits by American politicians because of disagreeable views, should it not also ban American politicians who, for example, found good things to say about neo-Nazis marching in Charlottesville? Tlaib and Omar are certainly wrong when it comes to Israel. But by preventing them from coming to the country, Israel only empowers their positions and emboldens its critics.

The key to good intelligence is facts, data, unvarnished analysis, and no politics. That this bears repeating in today, as we face threats from domestic terrorism to nuclear weapons, is alarming to us as the former chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee.
Yet, we find ourselves mutually perplexed by what is taking place within the national dialogue on how the intelligence community is being treated, how its leadership is being judged, and the downright frightening trends we see. These are trends that, if left unchecked, will put us all in danger.
Let us say unequivocally and without hesitation that our intelligence professionals are brave and patriotic government servants. They work in the most dangerous places, tackling the hardest problems, often at great risk. At the CIA, even those who make the ultimate sacrifice become an unnamed star on a memorial wall and a blank space in the book of honor. Knowing this, they still willingly and eagerly put themselves in danger.
There are those at the top of the intelligence community today who understand this. CIA Director Gina Haspel
and soon to be departing Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon embody its finest traditions of service and patriotism. They have dedicated their lives to protecting our republic, its values, and its citizens. Most importantly, these intelligence leaders have refused to become partisan footballs.
They know their job is to provide our national leadership with facts and analysis, unclouded by partisan ideology or the political winds of the day. Their job, in some ways, is the hardest. They must speak truth to power. If they allow their analysis to be manipulated by what they think political leaders want to hear or if they censor themselves to avoid countering the philosophies of political leaders, then their information is worthless. We have seen what happens when politics influences intelligence. Mistakes are made, lives are lost, and our national security is imperiled.
Why would a foreign source want to work with our intelligence officers if she knows or believes her information will not be taken seriously or valued? Or, worse, disclosed intentionally or unintentionally? Why would the intelligence services of our allies want to cooperate with us if they believe that their information or warnings will not be heeded?
By publicly denigrating the service of our intelligence professionals and questioning their loyalty and the quality of the product they produce, politics is being injected into intelligence. Playing political games with the leadership of the intelligence community is setting a dangerous precedent for the future, where this and successive administrations will only be told what they want to hear or what the intelligence community believes they want to hear. That is something we cannot afford.

Our adversaries are enjoying the disruption and schisms between the White House, Congress, and the intelligence community. Why not? The “main enemy” is fighting amongst itself over what should be an evident truth, but apparently is not anymore. Our intelligence professionals on the frontlines are carrying out their duties and will continue to do so. But assaults from the top, a perception that their work will not be valued or information heard, and seeing their leaders undermined for purely sycophantic political reasons will only degrade our national security.
Politics clearly no longer stops at the edge of water. We no longer keep our differences in the family. But when it comes to intelligence, our best defense against terrorism and the nonstop barrage of other threats we face as a nation, politics must certainly be checked at the door.

can voice doubts as to whether President Trump
is not racist, then do not expect the rest of the United States to be more sympathetic to the president on that score. To be clear, earlier doubts from Bannon have since dissipated as the election draws closer, while Anthony Scaramucci
, another exiled White House veteran, has supplanted Bannon as the latest punching bag for Trump.
In the past, Bannon, the man who played an outsized role in engineering the 2016 upset, has acknowledged his own misgivings about Trump and bigotry. A key source for Michael Wolff for his blockbusters “Fire and Fury” and “Siege,” Bannon discounted to Wolff the probability of Trump being anti-Semitic. When it came to African Americans, however, Bannon took a different take. As Wolff framed things in “Siege,” Bannon was actually “less confident” that Trump was not racist.
Apparently, so too are others. According to a Quinnipiac University poll, about half of voters surveyed, 51 percent to be precise, believe the president to be racist. The public sentiment has grown over time and shows no sign of abating. A subsequent HuffPost/YouGov poll tells a similar tale about Trump and white nationalism.
This congealing perception is the byproduct of the agnosticism Trump showed over Charlottesville, his recent tweetstorms, and his earlier references to Mexicans as rapists, among other memorable public pronouncements. Beyond that, trashing Elijah Cummings of Baltimore as racist as Trump did and telling the “squad” to “go home” is not a particularly good look. At a certain point, folks who are elected president are expected to start sounding “presidential.”
Then there is Trump pushing the “birtherism” movement against Barack Obama and that episode from the 1970s, when Trump allegedly refused to rent apartments to black tenants and was then sued for housing discrimination by Justice Department during the Nixon administration. That is more than a 40 year run for those who are counting.
Against this backdrop, Trump cannot shake his reputation. It is the one label that evokes his rage like no other. When Trump declares that he is the “least racist” person, it is tacit acknowledgement that he has a problem on that score and, if the polls and White House chatter are to be believed, he is not wrong. Antipathy toward Trump on race is pronounced among African Americans, women, and white voters with a college degree. In other words, the same electoral coalition that helped flip control of the House in 2018 does not take kindly to the president.
While Midwest suburbs may be pleased with the Trump tax cuts, the moms of Southern Methodist University are offended by his mien, and they are hardly alone. These days, even the “Mooch” thinks that Trump has gone too far. As he put it, “For the last 3 years I have fully supported this president. Recently he has said things that divide the country in a way that is unacceptable. So I didn’t pass the 100% litmus test. Eventually he turns on everyone and soon it will be you and then the entire country.” Unsurprisingly, Scaramucci has earned the ire of his former boss.

Trump: Election results could be delayed by months
All this brings us back to Bannon. In the days following the publication of “Fire and Fury,” Trump banished Bannon from the proverbial kingdom, and gave him the moniker “Sloppy Steve.” But these days Trump enthuses about Bannon, calling him his star student and tweeting, “Nice to see that one of my best pupils is still a giant Trump fan. Steve joined me after I won the primaries, but I loved working with him!” His pupil? Not exactly. Back in the day, Trump would walk the halls of the conservative Freedom Summit pining for Bannon, according to “Devil’s Bargain” by Bloomberg correspondent Joshua Green, asking “Where’s my Steve?”
Apparently, Trump and Bannon have reconciled. Last weekend, Bannon forgot his own doubts about the prejudices of the president, and told a talk radio host that opponents of Trump “realize that they can’t defeat him on the policies so they’re going to smear him as being a racist, a white supremacist, all of this stuff, and I don’t think any of it holds water.” Note the present tense. Let bygones be bygones. Expect Bannon to return to the Trump campaign before Election Day 2020.

In today’s heated political environment, the legal consequences of manager missteps can be severe.
Political talk in the workplace is a challenging issue for managers to address. Discussions can rapidly devolve into debates and fights, making the working environment uncomfortable and negatively impacting productivity and morale. Social media has raised the stakes. In extreme cases, these discussions can jeopardize client relationships and increase the risk of ancillary claims of harassment, bias, discrimination, bullying and retaliation.
Managers typically find themselves on the frontline when employees complain about bad workplace behaviors. An estimated 70 percent of complaints are made directly to managers as opposed to human resources or the legal department. Our research suggests that due to inadequate training, managers are consistently unprepared to handle these situations effectively. As a result, they expose themselves and their organizations to substantial liability.
If the allegations made by McCabe and Strzok against DOJ managers are proven to be true, it will serve as an important reminder to employers of all kinds that they need to exercise caution when dealing with employees who are expressing political views.
A cornerstone of the allegations by both McCabe and Strzok is that their terminations represented punishment for expressing constitutionally protected political opinions. Many are surprised to learn that First Amendment rights do not typically apply in the context of private-sector employers, but managers need to understand there are important exceptions.
For example, certain state laws protect employees in this regard. A manager at a restaurant may be legally permitted to terminate an employee who is critical of President Trump
, but the devil is in the details. The First Amendment is intended to protect citizens from government actions that impede free speech, so public-sector workers are generally protected. Again, there are some important exceptions (for instance, the Hatch Act).
Retaliation is a particularly contentious issue raised in the McCabe complaint that is poorly understood by most frontline managers — and this is very dangerous. The lower burden of proof required for retaliation claims has led to a surge of complaints in recent years. And yet, 56 percent of the managers who participated in our workplace incident training simulations failed to discuss or explain retaliation with the complainant, witnesses or the alleged perpetrator. As a result, complainants or witnesses often fear they will be retaliated against and will be more alert to any perceived retaliatory behaviors. Furthermore, if alleged perpetrators are not clear on how broadly retaliation can be defined, they can wittingly or unwittingly engage in behaviors that expose the organization to further liability.
Of all the forms of bad workplace behavior, retaliation is the most corrosive. It masks malignancies that grow within a culture until they finally burst into view and lead to the questions: How long has this been going on? Why didn’t anyone say anything?
Managers will always be on the frontline when tough workplace issues arise — “going to your manager” is ingrained in every employee, and there is often fear and reticence about reporting directly to HR. Accordingly, as managers, we all need to practice being the leaders our teams expect us to be. We need to learn how to deal with employees who are engaging in contentious political conversations in the workplace.

Most manager training involves watching a video and answering some multiple-choice questions. The fact is, our research shows this approach does not adequately prepare us to deal with emotionally-charged workplace conversations and debates that can often escalate into allegations of harassment, bias, discrimination, bullying and retaliation.
We need to provide our managers with the opportunity to practice dealing with these scenarios in a safe and realistic way so, when real issues arise, they will be able to handle them effectively and decisively. Let’s give them the skills they need to be successful, and let’s make sure that political debates at the office don’t escalate into legal fights.

Before lawmakers left town for the August recess, they passed a budget agreement lifting federal spending caps and the debt ceiling for two years. Our lawmakers in the House had already drafted, marked up, and passed several spending bills before the recess. The budget deal has set the stage for the Senate to begin doing the same.
With the funding deadline fast approaching at the end of September, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he is eager to begin marking up the fiscal 2020 spending bills as soon as lawmakers return to Washington one month from now. So while senators will spend the next few weeks chatting up their constituents back home, their appropriations staffers will be hustling in a frenzied dash to draft a dozen spending bills.
The context of the budget deal included an agreement to set aside poison pill riders. That commentary does not discuss legacy riders, which are ideological poison pills that members of Congress were forced to swallow so they could pass previous spending bills. Those policies get carried over from one budget cycle to the next, sometimes for decades. The House spending bills removed many legacy riders that blocked crucial campaign finance rules, key public health measures, and important environmental protections. Senate appropriators should certainly also remove them.
The legacy campaign finance policies wrongly prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from finishing a rule requiring corporations to disclose their political spending, obstruct a rule that would require the disclosure of political spending by federal government contractors, and stop the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department from clarifying the rules on the political activity of nonprofit organizations.
Some of the legacy public health riders single out initiatives and programs in the District of Columbia, including health care funding for women and the decriminalization of marijuana. The other public health riders target nutritional guidelines, family planning funding for the United Nations, and federal studies of toxic chemicals. The legacy environmental riders block several rules aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, endangered species protections for the greater sage grouse, limits on lead used in ammunition for hunting that poisons the environment, and much more.
Measures that let corporations game the political system, interfere with the independence of the District of Columbia, shut down critical public health protections, and attack our environment do not belong in federal spending legislation year after year. Senate appropriators and their staffers should make sure they are removed from the spending bills.

Senate Democrats prepare seven-figure spending spree in Texas
Once lawmakers return from the August recess, senators will have just three weeks to mark up and pass all of their appropriations bills out of committee and send them on to the floor by the deadline at the end of September. Senators should not insist on keeping any policies not in the public interest that the House already voted to remove. If they do, they will be throwing a wrench in the process and risking yet another costly and politically embarrassing government shutdown in early October.
It would be reckless to risk a disruptive shutdown over bad legacy items that never belonged. It would be unprincipled to do so after agreeing to a budget deal that calls for no poisonous provisions. Senate appropriators and their staffers have their work cut out for them and very little time to complete it. They should leave out such old policies that harm the public.

The answer to this seemingly contradictory question holds an important clue about how we can get Congress working again.
In my experience, most of the lawmakers on Capitol Hill are decent and hardworking people who simply want to serve their country and help their constituents. But upon taking the oath of office, these virtues collide with bad incentives and an entrenched culture in Congress that undermines constructive collaboration. These forces pull lawmakers from different parties in opposite directions and starve them of the chances to form personal bonds across the aisle needed for a healthy legislative process.
Long gone are the days when both Republican and Democratic families attended the same social events, when their kids went to school together, or when they took legitimate bipartisan trips to seek common solutions to challenging issues and get to know one another on a stronger personal level. Instead, it is now a badge of honor to sleep on your office couch and take the first flight back home to prove that you are not a swamp dwelling Washington insider. Moreover, the demands of fundraising make it nearly impossible to do anything except dial for dollars during your down time.
So how bad is it today? Even the shuttle busses at the orientation for freshman members of Congress are divided between Republicans and Democrats. Caucus meetings and policy lunches are all conducted along purely partisan lines. All the committees, which traditionally have been engines of democracy and the place where members work together to build bipartisan bridges, have been systematically weakened as party leaders increasingly script and dictate major pieces of legislation.
But the situation is not hopeless. Elected officials want opportunities to get to know one another even when they disagree on policy. When they do, good things happen. Consider a bill earlier this year, which eventually became law, introduced jointly by Republican Jack Bergman of Michigan and Democrat Stephanie Murphy of Florida to help our returning service members reenter the civilian workforce. This collaboration happened after each visited the district of the other during a weekend on a Bipartisan Policy Center program known as the American Congressional Exchange.
Since the launch of this program last year, more than two dozen members have visited the district of a colleague from the opposite side of the aisle, and at least 10 more trips are scheduled this year. Along with the bill from Bergman and Murphy, other trips have also resulted in Republican and Democratic members teaming up to work successfully on criminal justice reform and add amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act.
In a similar vein, we recently held the first bipartisan freshman sophomore class retreat for members of Congress, spearheaded by the presidents of those two classes. The explicit and unsubtle premise of the gathering was discussing how to support and protect the desire of newer members to work across the aisle and fend off pressure to pursue partisan victory over substantive achievement. The pressure to choose party over nation was acknowledged to be increasing as the focus shifts to the 2020 election.
Members of Congress also noted that the disincentive to collaborate was not limited to the culture of Washington, but reinforced by constituents, donors, and the media. As there is always strength in numbers, our goal with these convenings is to enable pragmatists to unite and defend one another from the forces of rigidity and division. Congress would quickly become more competent if party leaders rewarded members for spending time on Capitol Hill, in committee meetings, and out on fact finding trips.

To be sure, there was never a time when lawmakers sat around a bonfire singing folk songs. Within a free and diverse nation, conflict and tumult will always be the norm. The key to the successful American experiment has been a shared sense of purpose and the capacity for reconciling our intense differences. While personal trust between lawmakers is certainly not sufficient to achieve effective consensus, it is nearly impossible to resolve real policy differences and move forward for the nation without it.
Thankfully, we do not need an alien invasion or new Constitution or to recapture a sense of common purpose. But we do need to change the incentives that have made Congress brittle and weakened deliberative capacity. Let us encourage our lawmakers to get to know one another again. It is not disloyal or unpatriotic to spend time with someone you disagree with. It is indeed one of the most American things you can do.

is one that defies conventional wisdom and attempts at prognostication. But beyond the reactions to salacious tweets, electric “Make America Great Again” rallies, and political food fights with the establishment, Trump may be best remembered for an otherwise traditional policy achievement with his tax cuts enacted during his first year of office.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act combined a number of conservative initiatives into a package giving 82 percent of middle class earners a break. While tax reform had a positive effect on families and economic growth, it also created an unintended consequence likely to harm Republicans down the road by sparking a major exodus of voters from blue states to red states. These demographic shifts will have significant political impacts on some of the most critical swing states and could make it more challenging for Republicans to win future elections on both the state and federal levels.
The tax bill mostly closed a major loophole for wealthy residents in blue states with the state and local tax deduction. By capping this at $10,000, Republicans ended a big subsidy to residents burdened by high taxes in states like New York, New Jersey, California, and Illinois, giving these residents more incentive to pack up and relocate to the low tax states.
In New York City, residents pay about 12.7 percent of their income in state and local taxes. For the middle and high income earners, the law drove their taxes up even further since they can no longer deduct such steep taxes. One in every 25 New Yorkers is a millionaire, who each now owes Uncle Sam $21,000 more than they did before the law went into effect. Waves of New Yorkers have already fled south to low tax states like Texas and Florida, both of which have no personal income tax. The exodus is so significant that Governor Andrew Cuomo said earlier this year that the state had faced an unexpected $2.3 billion budget shortfall.
California is also hemorrhaging middle and high income earners to low tax states, and Texas by far is their top destination. It is no coincidence that the fastest growing states are low tax red or purple states that are attracting economic refugees from blue states. On the one hand, these trends are vindication for Republicans, as people flock to conservative states with responsible fiscal policy and low taxes. On the other hand, these shifts could raise difficulties for Republicans in electoral politics.
The 2018 elections may be a small piece of an emerging demographic picture, but we can see parts of a trend coalescing. Cities in Texas are growing faster than cities in all other states. As its population rises with former residents of blue states, there is a growing probability that Texas will become the most consequential swing state in elections to come.
The small government model of low taxes in other states is also acting as an even stronger magnet for residents of blue states after the tax cuts. The tailwind of economic growth and state and local tax deductions is making the decision to move easier for those from blue states. Recent census figures show that the 10 fastest growing states during that time span have low taxes, and that seven of them were reliably Republican.
All these states saw shifts toward the left during the 2018 elections. In Colorado, Republicans came within less than three points of winning the gubernatorial race in 2014 before falling by more than 10 points last year. In Nevada, Republicans could not capitalize on five former consecutive victories, losing the gubernatorial race by four points. In South Carolina, Republicans shrank their advantage in the gubernatorial race to eight points. In Arizona, Republicans took their three point victory in the 2012 Senate race and turned it into a three point loss in the 2018 Senate race.

Perhaps the best example is one that shows the microcosm of the tax law combined with the new shape of politics. Georgia had the seventh largest increase in population last year. The combination of immigrants from other nations, black Americans returning to the south in increasing numbers, and residents fleeing blue states sets the stage for the most contested gubernatorial race of the 2018 cycle. The massive increase in turnout for groups that favor Democrats assisted them in the election.
As the strong economic growth lifts already growing red states, migration will continue to transform the demographics and political calculus across the country. Ultimately, Trump could be remembered for ushering in this era of prosperity, along with inadvertently pushing waves of voters from blue states to red states who could undo his legacy in coming elections.

The tenure of Democrats in control of the House of Representatives has been defined by infighting, extremism, and attacks on President Trump
. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
and other Democratic leaders have promised the American people meaningful legislation and problem solving, but have instead chosen to use their power in Congress to sow chaos and play political games. In doing so, they have empowered the radical liberal fringe of the party, and now they stand to pay the price.
Pelosi knows that she must find a way to restrain the ascendent radicals in her party. Otherwise, the accelerating slide toward left wing socialism will send swing voters sprinting back toward Trump ahead of the critical 2020 election. The rest of the Democratic leadership is equally aware of this fact. According to Axios, an internal poll is revealing that the progressive socialist agenda driven by identity politics is poisoning the reputation of the party among the important swing voters who decide close elections.
These swing voters see the far left has commandeered the Democratic Party, which they associate with its most unhinged members. The internal poll found that freshman Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar enjoy relatively high name recognition, but also suffer from low approval ratings, a doomsday scenario for Pelosi and the moderate Democrats who gave the party a House majority in the 2018 midterms. While 74 percent of respondents said they are familiar with Ocasio-Cortez, only 22 percent viewed her favorably. Omar fared worse, as 53 percent of respondents recognize who she is, but just 9 percent view her favorably.
In fact, their approval ratings have actually decreased as their name recognition has grown, suggesting that things will get even worse for Democrats the longer the “squad” of radical freshman representatives in Congress keeps providing headline fodder with their extremist rhetoric and proposals. Working Americans do not want socialism and identity politics, and they reject such efforts to remake the United States in the image of Venezuela. Ocasio-Cortez and her band of radicals are now the de facto leaders of the Democratic Party, and swing voters do not like it. An internal poll found that 69 percent of respondents view socialism unfavorably, while a solid majority of them view capitalism positively.
Pelosi was able to reclaim the gavel thanks to the improved performance of Democrats among the noncollege educated whites who had flocked to Trump in 2016, and she is well aware they still have the power to take it away from her in 2020. Despite the media narrative about the American demographic transition, noncollege educated whites remain the largest electoral bloc in the country by a significant margin, constituting about half of the voting public. In 2016, Trump scored the largest victory by a presidential candidate in this demographic since 1980, and Republicans subsequently gained control in Washington. In 2018, Democrats improved their performance with this group by allowing moderate candidates to run very competitively on moderate platforms in Republican leaning districts.

But with the rise of the radical left, the gains the Democrats made among noncollege educated whites in 2018 are being rapidly erased. Voters who supported moderate Democrats now see that those representatives are beholden to the extremist fringe of the party and are therefore utterly incapable of delivering their campaign promises. Against this backdrop, Trump stands to make massive gains in 2020. His impressive economic stewardship, bold approach to international trade, foreign policy restraint, and laserlike focus on advancing all the interests of the American people only make the apocalyptic rhetoric of the far left sound even more absurd.
Where Trump has earned the trust of the American people by fulfilling his promises, Pelosi and the Democrats have betrayed that trust by granting their most irresponsible members free rein to advance their destructive agenda and spout their hateful rhetoric. The Democrats who leaked the internal polling clearly hope that they can persuade their party to reverse course before the 2020 campaign season gets going in earnest, but the continuing stalemate between Pelosi and the rambunctious “squad” of radicals suggests that it may be too late to stuff that cat back in the bag.

0,07/22/19 09:30 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/454029-in-europe-anti-semitism-is-back-from-the-masses-to-their-leaders,"In Europe, anti-Semitism is back, from the masses to their leaders","There comes a time in any decent person’s life when they should face reality and say, “No more.” We are at such a point — the radical has become mainstream, and anti-Semitism has moved from the edges of society to the heart of the political system in certain European countries.
When we look at the situation, in Europe and the United States, with clear eyes and zoom out to get a full view, we can’t help but reach the sad, scary conclusion that anti-Semitism is back. We may be facing the strongest rise of anti-Semitism in decades, as it comes from both directions — from the leaders to the masses, and from the masses to the leaders. And while we usually identified anti-Semitism as a radical right-wing phenomenon, its current reincarnation often comes from the other end of the spectrum — the radical left.
It may be more sophisticated, yet it is just as violent as it always has been. Behind its new, civilized mask of political opposition to Israel’s policies, anti-Semitism has the potential to be extremely dangerous, since it erodes the very basis on which the free world has stood since the end of World War II. This basis is a shared set of values that have become the consensus in politics and international relations. Among others, they include the sanctity of free speech until the point where it becomes incitement, the sovereignty of nation-states and absolute intolerance for racism.  
With too many incidents and processes in today’s Europe, we can’t turn a blind eye to the fact that, at least when it comes to anti-Semitism and its disguise as anti-Israel criticism, Europe is failing on those counts. 
When it comes to the distinction between freedom of speech and violent incitement, the line was crossed long ago. A survey published by the European Commission this month found that 44 percent of Jews between the ages of 18-34 have experienced some sort of anti-Semitic attack. Many of them now hide their Jewish identities for fear of harassment, attacks and violence. We usually only hear about the deadly attacks, such as the ones on a Jewish school in Toulouse or the Parisian kosher grocery store, but Jewish people deal with some sort of anti-Semitism regularly. 
Of course, we can’t ignore the reality here in America. Just a short while ago, the New York Times published the now infamous caricature of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
as a guide dog, with a Star of David around his neck, leading a blind President Trump
. The cartoonist made an effort not to miss even one classic anti-Semitic representation. Clearly, this is “All the news that’s fit to print” in today’s NYT. However, here also in the U.S., anti-Semitism doesn’t stay on paper. The past 10 months have seen two deadly attacks on Jewish worshippers while they prayed in local synagogues, one in Pennsylvania and the other in California, taking the lives of 12 people.
As for intolerance to racism, the legendary cradle of democracy, Great Britain, has a giant cloud hanging above Westminster in the form of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party. If past politicians had to hide their racist beliefs in order to get elected, the story here is different. Everyone knew that Corbyn is anti-Semitic, yet it didn’t hurt his chances to win his party leadership. Since his election, the floodgates have opened and many other Labour members of Parliament have come out of the woodwork with similar dark views; in the last election, two years ago, their power grew. The party has become so infested with anti-Semitism that two former Labour prime ministers — Tony Blair and Gordon Brown — have come out publicly against this dangerous trend.
Even I had the dubious luck of being the target for Corbyn’s arrows, when he claimed that I fed talking points to members of Parliament and they did my bidding when I served as Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom. Not even I knew how powerful I was, and I only wish someone had told me that in real time. It would have made my efforts there so much easier!
The European record on respecting the sovereignty of nation-states also is abysmal, at least when it comes to the Jewish state. It seems like what’s right for every other country is wrong for Israel. Last week, a so-called exposé in the left-leaning German magazine Der Spiegel focused on pro-Israel lobbying groups and their “underhanded techniques” of influencing parliamentary decisions. Seems like the same practices performed by almost every country or corporation in the western world is forbidden when it comes to the Jewish state. The famous triple standard rears its ugly head again — one standard for democracies, one for dictatorships, and one completely unattainable standard for Israel.

The fight against anti-Semitism is not an easy one, and it can’t be left for Jewish people and Israel alone. The first step is to recognize that there’s a problem, because you can’t start the healing process before you acknowledge there’s an actual disease. You can’t just band it together with other forms of injustice, prejudice or racism. Yes, the world must combat all of those, but when you don’t treat anti-Semitism as the unique form of racism that it is and has always been, you can not overcome it.
While some in Europe have taken a stand against rising anti-Semitism, words will not suffice. Leadership is about action, not statements, and if Europe’s leaders fail to act, then, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, this could be the beginning of the end for Europe as we know it.

0,07/18/19 02:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/453702-why-puerto-ricans-have-taken-to-the-streets-to-oust-their-governor,Why Puerto Ricans have taken to the streets to oust their governor,"Summers in Puerto Rico are usually hot. But the month of July 2019 has been particularly scorching in Puerto Rico, and not just because of climate change.
The oldest colony under the U.S. flag is collapsing. Shocking revelations as to the contents of a “chat” in the messaging application Telegram between Puerto Rico’s Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and his closest advisors, caused an unprecedented constitutional crisis.
Days before the Telegram drama unfolded, a federal grand jury returned a 32-count indictment against Puerto Rico’s former secretary of Education, the former head of the Health Services Administration, and other individuals.
The governor’s “locker-room” conversations suggest political persecution, including the attempt to fire the wife of a political opponent, so she would be replaced by a member of his party. The messages include insults and homophobic slurs against an opposing candidate for governor and his wife. They also show threats of violence (Chief Financial Officer: “I'm salivating to shoot her up [a mayor]”; Rosselló: “You'd be doing me a big favor.”)
It doesn’t stop there. The chat also includes calling the former Speaker of the New York City Assembly a “whore.” They show exchanges of confidential information between government officials and a lawyer for energy companies, about a request for qualifications (RFQ) for the public electric utility PREPA. And the conversations depict efforts to discredit the monitor of the Police of Puerto Rico, appointed by a Federal judge, humiliating jokes against an obese party loyalist and a politically-motivated criminal referral against a political opponent.
The revelations of this chat led to a Nixonian “Saturday Night Massacre,” Puerto Rican style. The governor forced the resignations of his secretary of State  — next in line in the order of succession — as well as the government’s chief financial officer and other participants of the chat.
The surprising nature of this political drama is that Rosselló suffered from a similar scandal in 2018. The revelation of controversial Whatsapp conversations during the 2016 campaign led to the resignations of the governor’s chief of staff and other prominent officials, as well as criminal charges against a former judge.    
Prominent members of the governor’s party, religious groups, artists such as Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin (himself a target of homophobic comments in the chat), and numerous organizations from the private sector and civil society, have called for his resignation. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) stated that “all credibility [of the Rosselló administration] has been lost. It is clear that the families of Puerto Rico need leadership committed to creating better opportunities on the island.” Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who is chairman of the congressional committee with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico, joined the calls for resignation.
The Trump White House stated that “the unfortunate events of the past week in Puerto Rico prove the President’s concerns about mismanagement, politization, and corruption have been valid. We remain committed to Puerto Rico’s recovery and steadfast in protecting taxpayers and the Puerto Rico survivors from political corruption and financial abuse.”
The people of Puerto Rico are frustrated with Rosselló, the island’s legislature and politics in general. Since 2006, Puerto Rico has struggled with an economic depression, as well as one of the largest migration patterns in a non-war-torn country.
An unprecedented fiscal crisis led Congress to create a Financial Oversight and Management Board, which effectively overruled self-government in the commonwealth. Rosselló’s mismanagement in the aftermath of Hurricane María precipitated the deaths of nearly 3,000 residents of Puerto Rico, who suffered for months without electricity or proper health care. Puerto Ricans are tired — and restless.
Rosselló is refusing calls for resignation. Thousands have taken to the streets of Old San Juan, where the Governor’s Mansion, La Fortaleza, is located. Boricuas in Washington D.C., New York, Boston, Texas and even cities of Europe, are marching to demand the governor’s resignation. The hashtag #RickyRenuncia even became a trending topic on Twitter.
After days of hesitation, Puerto Rico’s Speaker of the House of Representatives announced that he would appoint a panel of attorneys to “study” possible causes of impeachment. If Rosselló were to be impeached and removed, he would be the ninth governor in U.S. history to be ousted in that manner.

Rosselló must resign — or be impeached. As Pete Townshend wrote almost 50 years ago, “We'll be fighting in the streets / With our children at our feet”. We won’t get fooled again.
The events unfolding during this Nixonian summer are the result of failed territorial policies, local corruption and cronyism. Congress and the Trump administration must take appropriate measures so that disaster-recovery appropriations are properly disbursed to the people in need without delay, even while bypassing the failed and corrupt Rosselló administration.

0,07/15/19 03:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/453078-a-better-way-to-fix-gerrymandering-math,A better way to fix gerrymandering: math,"Americans across party lines strongly disapprove of gerrymandering, and rightly so. Gerrymandering undermines the foundational principle underlying the American system of district-based representation: namely, that voters within a constituency should share local perspectives and live reasonably near one another. When the Supreme Court recently held that the judiciary has no authority to curtail gerrymandering, many would-be reformers were disappointed. 
They shouldn’t be. The court’s decision provides an opportunity to turn away from failing gerrymandering reform strategies, and toward a better way.
A typical person on the street can sense, merely by looking at a map, whether gerrymandering is out of control. It’s visually obvious when the shapes of legislative districts have been warped and twisted in improbable fashion. Preventing this requires limiting the discretion of political mapmakers to distort district shapes beyond the limits of common sense.
Unfortunately, a misguided focus on litigating gerrymandering’s political effects has diverted potentially useful reforms for the past several years. Gerrymandering reform is too often approached as a mechanism for the redistribution of political power, and calls for judicial intervention are too often attempts to “win” the redistricting process. But, as Chief Justice John Roberts correctly wrote in the Supreme Court’s recent decision, nothing provides “a solid grounding for judges to take the extraordinary step of reallocating power and influence between political parties.”
The political approach to gerrymandering reform was misguided for several reasons. First, the Constitution protects individual voting rights, but it offers no similar protections for combinations of interests, and especially not for political parties, which many founders abhorred. Moreover, gerrymandering can occur for a wide variety of reasons — not only for partisan advantage, but also for reasons such as protecting powerful incumbents or demographic minorities. And of course, framing reform in partisan terms only increases resistance to it, as well as drawing the courts into political battles where they do not belong.
Worst of all, approaching gerrymandering reform as a political balancing act does nothing to address the evils most Americans find in the practice. This is because gerrymandering to the benefit of one party in one place would become acceptable as long as it was balanced by gerrymandering to favor another party elsewhere. This flawed approach risks creating more gerrymandering rather than less, as well as doing nothing to mitigate ideological polarization, make general elections more competitive, or make elected officials more responsive to the average voter. 
Gerrymandering can and should be constrained, but we need to get the focus off of political engineering and back onto simple good governance. The Constitution provides the process for doing so, through its Elections Clause specifying that Congress can “make or alter” the rules for congressional elections. Congress has used this authority many times in the past to require compactness in congressional districting, and could easily do so again.
Constraining the irregularity of district shapes is no more difficult than the simplest mathematics. All that is necessary is for legislators to enact a limit on how long a district’s perimeter can be relative to its area (with adjustments for the portion of the boundary over which mapmakers have no control). This would by itself eliminate all the worst instances of gerrymandering in one fell swoop. A forthcoming study I have authored for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University explores specific methods for doing exactly that, including options that would invalidate roughly 5-8 percent of current congressional districts depending on the standard adopted by lawmakers, with the effects of reform concentrated on the most gerrymandered states.

Such an approach would be far superior to nebulous determinations of political motivations or advantage, or which introduce subjective and controversial value judgments. Instead of parsing the perceived motivations or effects of gerrymandering, it would directly limit the gerrymandering itself — and in a way that is simple, clear, national, and neutral.
The national discussion of gerrymandering has been so dominated of late by political framing that it will take a major attitude adjustment for many reform advocates to approach the problem in a fresh way. But reform won’t happen if reformers are simply seeking to replace one form of political engineering with another. Durable and broadly accepted reforms will only be adopted if we refocus the discussion on the foundational purpose of legislative districting — that voters within the same constituency are those who live near to one another.

0,07/12/19 04:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/452844-eliminate-primary-elections-to-restore-our-strong-democracy,Eliminate primary elections to restore our strong democracy,"We must change our present system of nominating candidates for office if we want to make our version of democracy effective again. Our system of government in the United States has developed a major imbalance in the form of a transfer of power from the legislative branch to the executive branch. The power of the executive branch has increased dramatically over the years because of growing weakness of the legislative branch.
Congress is capable of making laws only during brief periods when one political party has control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. During all other periods of time, legislative gridlock prevails on Capitol Hill and precludes the members of Congress from enacting any meaningful laws, except on a short term emergency basis. This legislative impotence creates a void that can only be filled by the executive branch.
Without major changes in the composition of the House and Senate, and the incentives for the members of Congress, our country will experience more adverse effects of the failure of our version of democracy. As federal statutes become increasingly obsolete, the executive branch will have no choice but to try to stretch the power Congress has delegated to it in ways that also put additional stress on the third branch of the judiciary.
The stakes are indeed high for our democracy. We must identify ways of encouraging members to engage in the kinds of compromises with each other and with the president that are essential to the ability to legislate. The starting point should be the process of nominating the candidates for office. Our present method yields candidates who are not representative of the views of a majority of the members of either political party, and it discourages members from entering any bipartisan negotiations that are essential to compromises that lead to legislation.
Primaries are simply low turnout elections. The few voters who choose to participate are the most ideologically extreme members of each political party. As a result, Democratic primaries select the candidates who are furthest to the left, and Republican primaries select the candidates who are furthest to the right. Primaries create a legislative body that is more polarized than the electorate. That greatly reduces the likelihood that the members of the House and Senate can negotiate and reach agreement.
The primary process discourages members from compromising or even trying to compromise. The vast majority of members represent districts or states that are “safe” in the sense that the candidate chosen by her party is virtually certain to win the general election. The only threat to a senator in a “safe” state or a representative in a “safe” district arises as a result of the primary process. If the member compromises or simply threatens to compromise by moving toward the center, she will likely face a primary challenger with an excellent chance of defeating the member by running then to her left if she is a Democrat or to her right if she is a Republican.
The risk of getting “primaried” by a party challenger is the only realistic risk that a member from a “safe” state or district confronts. She knows the risk increases if she moves to the center to compromise, so her only safe course of action becomes avoiding legislative compromises and taking positions on the left end of the ideological spectrum if she is a Democrat and on the right end of the ideological spectrum if she is a Republican.

The better alternative to primary elections would be the methods that both political parties used in the United States until the 1970s and that most of the other democracies in the world use to nominate candidates for office. The leaders of each party choose the candidates based on a combination of a correspondence between the potential values of the candidates and the values of the party, as well as an evaluation of the probability that the potential candidate will win the general election.
Since the dominant views of al the voters who participate in the general election are near the right end of the spectrum of the Democrats and near the left end of the spectrum of the Republicans, party leaders have a very powerful incentive to nominate centrists. The candidates who win the general election then have an incentive to take centrist positions and to compromise with members of the opposing party so that they can claim legislative success. A House and Senate whose members are nominated by party leaders are much more likely to be able to make the bipartisan compromises that are essential to the process of enacting legislation.

However, the thing that the billionaire spent most of his time and money collecting was powerful men, many of whom flew on his infamous plane, known as the “Lolita Express” for its crew of underaged girls. He referred to them as his “collection” and told friends, “I invest in people, be it politics or science. It is what I do.”
They were, in effect, his insurance policy. No one would want to see him prosecuted when plane logs or island guest books listed top names in the political and business worlds. None of the people Epstein collected and cultivated for years will acknowledge any real connection. These degrees of closeness could well prove as important legally as politically. So while Epstein warrants little sympathy, his prosecution may raise more troubling issues of double jeopardy, made worse by a new Supreme Court decision.
For the record, I have long criticized the secret deal that Epstein secured in 2007 with former United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and current United States labor secretary, Alexander Acosta
. The deal was a disgrace. It not only allowed Epstein to avoid a lengthy prison stint but, as recently found by a federal court, it violated federal law by hiding the details from more than 30 identified victims of Epstein.
However, one does not have to like Epstein to acknowledge the curious posture of the prosecution. In the Southern District of Florida, the Justice Department still defends the deal Acosta put together as valid despite the illegality of his actions. In the Southern District of New York, the Justice Department claims it is not bound by the agreement. Epstein, of course, insists his nonprosecution agreement and criminal plea covered much of the same period as the latest two count New York indictment this week.
Under the extraordinary agreement, Epstein pled guilty to state charges, accepted 13 months in jail, and registered as a sex offender. He not only avoided a life sentence but secured an agreement to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week, out of jail on “work release.” He simply had to sleep in jail. Moreover, the Southern District of Florida also agreed that he would not be prosecuted federally. Now, the Justice Department is insisting that was a deal with just one district and does not count in another district.
The fact that Acosta cut such a ridiculous deal with a serial sex abuser does not mean the deal is invalid. Cutting such nonprosecution deals are also usually meant to bind the Justice Department as a whole. Yet, this agreement said “in this district,” three words likely to come back to haunt Epstein. The Justice Department is basically saying his legal team failed to close a major loophole, since the agreement “expressly referred to that federal district” and did not “purport to bind any other office or district.” There is also Second Circuit case law enforcing such limiting language.
The fact that there are only two counts in the new federal indictment this week may indicate that New York prosecutors are looking for crimes not covered by the earlier agreement, including new charges connected to photos of allegedly underaged girls that were reportedly found in the safe of Epstein. To that end, they displayed a huge photo of Epstein at their press conference and encouraged any unknown victims to contact them.
Epstein has raised another possible claim under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, that he is being prosecuted twice for the same underlying conduct in both cases. The timing for that argument could not be worse for him. The Supreme Court ruled in Terance Gamble versus United States last month that “dual sovereignties” like Florida and the federal government can prosecute individuals for the same underlying acts without violating protections of the Constitution.
Some of us have been highly critical of that practice as effectively gutting the protection. Indeed, the danger of that happening applies not only to despised individuals like Epstein. As Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his dissent, “When governments may unleash all their might in multiple prosecutions against an individual, exhausting themselves only when those who hold the reins of power are content with the result, it is the poor and the weak, and the unpopular and controversial who suffer first, and there is nothing to stop them from being the last.” This is a key point.
Faced with rising disgust over its prior agreement with Epstein, the Justice Department has decided to ignore the obvious purpose of the original nonprosecution agreement and take another shot at him. Weirdly, Acosta, the man who approved the sweetheart deal in the first place, applauded the indictment as creating the possibility to “more fully bring” Epstein to justice. That was his very job as United States attorney in the first place.
Attorney General William Barr
is also placing great significance on the separate offices in the two districts. Barr has recused himself from an ongoing review of the plea agreement under the Southern District of Florida because his old law firm, Kirkland and Ellis, represented Epstein, although Barr himself had no role in the case. However, Barr will not recuse himself from the New York case, which is proceeding outside of the plea agreement. It could prove a precious distinction in the case, since the earlier agreement will be raised in New York proceedings.
It is a fitting level of chaos surrounding a man who actively sought to intermingle people in different aspects of his life. Indeed, the strange degrees of separation include the family of the attorney general. Epstein was a college dropout but was still hired in 1973 to teach calculus and physics at the prestigious Dalton School in Manhattan. The man who hired him for the job was headmaster Donald Barr, the father of William Barr.

The six degrees of Kevin Bacon is premised on the idea that everyone is connected by six people or less. As the list of interested parties grows, that seems true in the case of Epstein. But there is a great danger in creating a law of a different kind. The law should not depend on how powerful or unpopular a defendant may be. Epstein twisted the law in his favor with the help of Acosta. The law became more twisted when the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. argued in court eight years ago that Epstein should not be registered as a top level sex offender despite his dozens of victims, a leniency angrily rejected by the judge.
With the New York case, there is an effort to twist the law to get a second chance at prosecuting Epstein, despite his nonprosecution agreement and earlier plea agreement. It is quite likely to succeed, given the recent Supreme Court ruling. But prosecution by popular demand comes with its own dangers. Epstein made our criminal laws a matter for his personal convenience. We should care to not make it a matter of legal contrivance.

0,07/08/19 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/452011-american-women-can-have-it-all,American women can have it all,"For years, we were told as women that we “cannot have it all.” We were told that you cannot be a successful career professional, a devoted wife, a good mother, a woman of God, and a principled member of society at the same time. The notion that you have to choose one over another has been ingrained into the minds of millions of women, but that notion is wrong.
Today, thanks to cultural shifts and policy changes, the reality is women can absolutely have it all. This is a new era and the numbers clearly reflect this. There are now more college educated women in the workforce than college educated men, and mothers are now the primary breadwinners in four out of 10 families in the United States. Over the past five decades, we have seen major societal shifts and policy changes that have made this one time dream a reality for American women across our great nation.
From the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, significant changes in federal law have been made that make it easier for working women to have it all. More recently, we saw the child tax credit doubled from $1,000 to $2,000 per child under the age of 17 under the leadership of President Trump
, which has been a significant benefit for middle class American mothers and families with children.
We have also seen a rise in female entrepreneurship. From 1997 to 2017, there was a 114 percent increase in the number of businesses owned by women. In 2018, there were more than 12 million businesses owned by women, who now comprise four out of 10 entrepreneurs in the United States. There are millions of women across the country who are setting the stage for a new era of working women who can have it all. Look at former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley
, who as the daughter of immigrants went on to become the first woman to serve as the governor of South Carolina while also raising two children alongside her husband.
Look at Laura Mills, an Ohio attorney, wife, mother and business owner who became known as a “champion for battered women,” all while raising her three children. Look at Nusha Pelicano, the owner of five Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt stores and a single mother of six children who wakes up to train at 4 a.m. each morning to be an Ironman competitor before taking her children to school. These women are the epitome of what it means to have it all. While much work has been done and women across the United States are thriving more than ever before, the fight is clearly not over yet.

Efforts for policy changes that support women and families continue to garner bipartisan support. Ivanka Trump
, who focuses on the education and economic empowerment of women, has said, “It is encouraging to see members on both sides of the aisle putting forward paid family leave proposals,” adding that more than 25 years since the Family and Medical Leave Act was passed by Congress, “we finally have bipartisan agreement on the importance of paid leave for working parents” in the United States.
Paid family leave and other key federal policies that are on the horizon in Washington will further serve to help women flourish with their careers, homes, and communities. The incredible women across our great nation continue to serve as daily testaments against the notion that women cannot have it all. The truth is American women can have it all in 2019.

0,07/04/19 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/451221-americans-must-get-mad-enough-to-reclaim-our-democracy,Americans must get mad enough to reclaim our democracy,"America today celebrates its 243rd birthday and, sadly, there isn’t much to celebrate. We can take some solace from the fact that we remain the world’s longest continuously operating democracy and have almost made it to a quarter of a millennium. But as patriotic songs play and fireworks explode, the truth is that our democracy may be threatened to an extent we have seen few times during its existence. 
It is threatened because the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision opened the floodgates for enormous sums of dark money to flow to campaigns, diluting the influence of ordinary citizens. 
Threatened because the Supreme Court basically has said that the most partisan acts of gerrymandering — which erode the power of our votes — are legal. Remember that the court approved North Carolina’s gerrymandering even in the face of a candid mission by a Republican legislator claiming that the 10-to-3 congressional map was drawn that way because they couldn’t figure out how to give Republicans 11 seats and Democrats only 2. 
Threatened by a deliberate, premeditated assault on the most cherished of our democratic ideals — the right to vote. In state after state, legislators, with the aid of some governors, are making it harder to vote, not easier. 
Threatened because of clear and resounding evidence that maybe more than one foreign power has attempted to disrupt our democratic process and they are determined to do so again. 
Threatened by misinformation spread via the internet — not just by foreign powers, but by domestic forces and horrible campaign practices. Take, for example, the fake website for former Vice President Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. 
Threatened because the leader of the greatest democracy the world has ever known is infatuated with the values and practices of foreign dictators and tyrants and disregards our alliances with other countries that prize democracy. 
Threatened by the increasing level of income inequality that is plaguing our nation. Notwithstanding the good economy, that disparity only increases. For example, with the ballyhooed 2017 tax reform, the top 1 percent will receive 83 percent of the gains as time goes on. 
And lastly, and perhaps the most dangerous of all, it is threatened by the continual lack of courage shown by our elected officials in state capitals and Washington, D.C. The people who represent us are so scared about losing their jobs that they simply ignore our wishes, even when our wishes clearly are the right path to follow.
There is no better example of this than the tragic and consequential issue of gun violence. We almost have become immune to the horror of mass shootings. When one occurs, our elected officials trip over themselves trying to send their “thoughts and prayers” to the victims and their families — but “thoughts and prayers” are all they have the guts to send. Far be it from us to send forth any meaningful legislation in the names of the victims. 
This cowardice was shown by Congress’s refusal to extend background checks for firearms  purchases and make them universal. Many politicians, mostly Republicans but even a few Democrats, ignored the wishes of most people of their states and voted no on this measure, even when polling showed that 80 to 95 percent of constituents wanted this to pass. They don’t even have the courage to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that have no purpose but to kill many people at once. 
This lack of courage isn’t confined to just curbing gun violence. It raises its head in so many different ways: the failure to increase the federal gas tax, which hasn’t been raised since 1994; the failure to acknowledge that climate change, caused in great part by man-made activity, is real must be addressed before it’s too late; the failure to impose any real punishment on the Russians for what they did and tried to do during the 2016 election; and there are many more examples.

There are two ways for us to combat this all-out assault on our democracy. One is for a leader to come along who can inspire other elected officials to put aside partisanship, overcome cowardice and do the right thing. However, if you believe that’s just a pipe dream — and I don’t — there is the second way. The American people must get fed up enough to put aside their differences and act decisively to reclaim our democracy. As Howard Beale extorted his audience to do in the 1976 film “Network,” we citizens have to literally and figuratively rise up and say, “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore!”
So, let’s all celebrate July Fourth by vowing to do just that. Remember, when asked by a woman what sort of government the Founding Fathers had given us, Benjamin Franklin replied, “A Republic, madam, if you can keep it.” It’s up to us to tell our leaders that democracy is what America is all about — and we not only want to keep it, but we want to reclaim it and work hard to make it stronger.

0,07/03/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/451486-dershowitz-author-michael-wolff-fictionalized-my-dinner-with-trump,Dershowitz: Author Michael Wolff fictionalized my dinner with Trump,"In his new bestselling book, “Siege: Trump Under Fire,” author Michael Wolff makes up a story about me from whole cloth. He wrote, “Dershowitz was invited to dinner at the White House to discuss representing the president. He was just the kind of lawyer the president thought he needed: an aggressive advocate who could argue his case on television. Over dinner, Dershowitz asked for a retainer of a million dollars. Trump, ever believing that part of the legal game was not paying your lawyers, told Dershowitz he would get back to him. But the conversation was over. Never in a million years would he pay a lawyer a million bucks up front!”
There is no truth whatsoever to this story. I never had a conversation with President Trump
or anyone else about a possible retainer to represent him. No figure of $1 million or anything else was ever discussed. The story is entirely fictional. I have published dozens of nonfiction books and, in every case, my editors have demanded that I get a confirmation or denial from anyone I am writing about. Yet, neither Wolff nor his publisher ever called me to ask me whether the story was true. If they had, I would have told them that it was false. At least then they could have printed my denial next to the false account. Instead, however, they simply went ahead and published their defamatory falsehood without even publishing my denial.
This is not journalism. It is fiction writing, and bad fiction at that. I doubt that Wolff even has a credible source for that story because there were only a handful of people at my dinner with the president, at which we primarily discussed the Middle East peace plan under the administration. None of them would make up such a story. If the source is someone not at the dinner, then Wolff should have said that he was relying on hearsay.
I do not know whether the rest of the book is filled with similar tales, but there is a legal principle that judges instruct jurors. When a person tells one falsehood, you should look skeptically at everything else that person says or writes. I urge readers of “Siege” to bear this principle in mind. Wolff himself is infamous for relying on not very credible sources and printing tales of fantasy. He is more an entertainer than a journalist. He panders to people who love to read gossip whether it is true or false.
While I am not one to throw around the term “fake news” with impunity, writers like Wolff hurt the credibility of real journalists who do not publish gossipy tidbits without any confirmation from credible sources. What is surprising is not what Wolff did, but what his publisher, editor, and lawyers did not do. Publishers have a responsibility to demand credible proof from their writers, especially when they are planning to publish material that is damaging to the reputation of a subject. The outright false claim that I asked for $1 million to represent the president, and that my demand was turned down, is damaging to my reputation if believed. It could also be the basis for a defamation action against both Wolff and his publishers.

It is surprising, therefore, that the lawyers for the publisher were not more demanding of Wolff to back up his claims. The lawyers for my publishers would never have allowed such a defamatory falsehood to be published without careful vetting. In my forthcoming book, “Defending Israel: The Story of My Relationship with My Most Challenging Client,” lawyers for the publisher had me take out material regarding several people I mentioned because I did not have any documented evidence of my criticisms, even though they were completely accurate. Yet, the lawyers for the publisher of Wolff let this falsehood about me be published without even the most minimal effort to reach me and get my reaction. If this is their standard regarding other claims made in the book, then let the reader beware.
Unfortunately, this careless attitude toward defaming others without corroboration is a sign of the times. In the age of Trump, where charges buzz around like mosquitoes, truth seems to be a diminishing virtue. Unless there are professional, reputational, and legal consequences for willfully disseminating false gossip, it will only get worse. Readers will suffer, good writers will suffer, and political dialogue will further erode.

0,07/02/19 01:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/451378-how-to-respond-to-the-nike-flag-sneaker-recall-just-dont-buy-it,How to respond to the Nike flag sneaker recall: 'Just don't buy it',"When it comes to free speech, Nike seems to have new slogan of “Just Don’t Do It.” This month, stores around the country received new Nike sneakers for the July 4th holiday, featuring an image of the Betsy Ross flag. Former National Football League quarterback Colin Kaepernick saw the 18th century flag image and was deeply offended. That was all that it took for Nike to order stores to return the shoes and not to sell them.
No one is suggesting that we are at risk of moving from rounding up sneakers to rounding up speakers. Nike is a private company entitled to curtail its own speech, while the First Amendment bars any government censorship. However, the incident captured perfectly the new view of free speech taking hold on campuses and across the country. It is not enough to protest the flag or the national anthem. It is necessary to prevent others from wearing or seeing the flag you deem offensive. Nike rounded up the sneakers, stating that it decided not to release the sneakers because they feature “the old version of the American flag.” Nike seemed to suggest it was evident that an American flag on a sneaker was obviously offensive.
For full disclosure, I did not agree with Kaepernick on his anthem protests and previously addressed the claim that professional football players and other employees have a right to engage in political protests of this kind. There are indeed legitimate and unresolved issues concerning race in our country, but the flag is as much a symbol of our aspirations as it is of our history. It embodies the very values that Kaepernick claims are denied to African American citizens, such as due process, equal justice, and equal protection. It also symbolizes our core democratic belief in free speech.
Many across the country celebrated the decision by Nike to destroy the sneakers and noted that the flag has been used by white nationalists. However, the flag also was used by civil rights marchers and Vietnam War protesters. It clearly means different things to different people. However, in this case, the only view deemed valid was that of Kaepernick and his supporters. Nike surprised many last year when it embraced Kaepernick as a spokesman and highlighted his controversial protests, despite the opposition of a majority of football fans, who had a legitimate gripe in this move that tied products to a political movement rejected by many consumers. Nike now has gone even further, refusing to allow its own customers to purchase shoes that Kaepernick views as offensive.
The trend is all too familiar to those of us who have watched free speech on campuses erode under expanding speech codes and rules. This trend began with changes advocated as protections for minority students in the creation of “free speech zones” that confined any expression of political or social viewpoints, as well as “safety zones” to protect students from ideas or images deemed offensive. It evolved into preventing others from espousing offensive ideas or images, from regulating Halloween costumes to rules against the undefined category of microaggressions, or speech that is not expressly racist, sexist, or offensive yet is viewed that way by another student. Finally, faculty members and students began blocking speakers from campuses to prevent others from hearing opposing views.
It is also a familiar trend in Europe, where free speech is being rapidly curtailed in countries like France, England, and Germany as people are routinely prosecuted for speech deemed offensive or inciting. Preachers have been arrested for publicly calling homosexuality to be a sin, while protesters have been arrested for supporting the boycott of Israel. Once you start regulating speech, the taste for censorship becomes insatiable.
Kaepernick is the embodiment of this twisted view of free speech. When Nike featured him in its “Just Do It” 30th anniversary campaign, it added the slogan, “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” One can certainly disagree with a company associating its products with a controversial political movement. Nike insisted it was not taking sides but celebrating the right to protest. Now, it seems to be following another mantra, “Believe in something. Even if it means silencing everyone else.”
That distinction between speaking and silencing has long been lost on campuses. A few years ago, University of California at Santa Barbara professor Mireille Miller Young led her students in attacking a pro-life display on campus and assaulted two young women behind it. Despite pleading guilty to criminal assault, she was defended by professors and students who called such displays “triggering” and akin to “terrorism.” She not only was not fired but has been celebrated as a hero, including being honored as a speaker at the University of Oregon as a symbol of “the radical potential of black feminism in the work that we do on campus and in our everyday lives.” Other faculty and students have led attacks on speakers on various campuses around the country without punishment.
I recently had a debate with a key supporter of criminal speech codes, who insisted that preventing others from speaking out is an act of free speech. He insisted that professors and students who block or heckle speakers into silence are exercising speech. This concept of silencing speakers as free speech is catching on around the country. All you have to do is call out speech by someone else to be triggering or offensive.
Over a dozen college presidents and members of the Higher Education Council of San Antonio recently concluded that there is no free speech protection for any words that spread, provoke, or create “animosity and hostility.” When conservatives were invited to come speak on campus at the University of California at Berkeley, more than 200 faculty members signed a letter calling for classes to be canceled and declaring that “there are forms of speech that are not protected under the First Amendment.”
Politicians and pundits have followed suit. Former Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont governor Howard Dean declared that hate speech is not actually protected under the First Amendment, while CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour asked former FBI director James Comey why he did not arrest Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign for hateful speech.

The lesson clearly has taken hold with students. Student editors like those at Wellesley College have declared that “hostility is warranted” against conservative speakers and that “shutting down rhetoric that undermines the existence and rights of others is not a violation of free speech” but is itself free speech. Polls show almost half of college students now believe hate speech is not protected under the Constitution, and one in three students believe violence is warranted to stop speech deemed hateful.
The “Just Don’t Do It” attitude will resonate with some who believe free speech means silencing others. Kaepernick has finally completed this inevitable cycle. He insisted that he was being punished for speaking in protest. Now, he seeks to prevent others from wearing the flag. It is akin to not only demanding to be able to kneel at football games but to prevent others from standing. Of course, there remain other ways of speaking. When it comes to Nike products, maybe try the slogan “Just Don’t Buy It.”

0,06/26/19 11:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/450399-this-is-how-the-debates-will-play-out,This is how the debates will play out,"The debates are speed dating with a national viewing audience. There will be 10 candidates tonight and 10 candidates tomorrow night. The strategic imperatives for each of them diverge widely. Here are five things to watch.
First, the “unknowns” must become known. For candidates polling in the neighborhood of 1 percent, such as Kirsten Gillibrand, Andrew Yang, Eric Swalwell, Tim Ryan, or Bill De Blasio, the debate stage will be a launchpad. They need to make the case to donors, activists, and primary voters that they are viable investments. If they leave the debate the way they came in, as mostly unknown, then they will have lost the debate and likely the race.
Second, the “knowns” must remain unscathed. For candidates at the head of the pack, they run with targets on their backs. Joe Biden
has the largest target and could find himself playing defense (full disclosure, I recently attended a fundraiser in New York City with the former vice president). But Elizabeth Warren has enjoyed a recent surge as a progressive, and there should be no surprise if you see some attempts to blunt her momentum.
Third, the “known unknowns” must sink or swim. Candidates like Cory Booker and Beto O’Rourke who have polled somewhere between the top and bottom tiers of the pack will use their moment in the spotlight to offer the public some more compelling rationales for why they should be the Democratic Party nominee. These middle tier candidates will either gas up or sputter out under the pressure of standing out on the debate stage.
Fourth, flats versus flubs. Candidates at the front of the pack have to mitigate risk and not make unforced errors, which sometimes translates into looking flat. Candidates at the back of the pack have to break out, which requires risk of an embarrassing flub. For the top tier candidates, a headline about appearing flat beats a headline about a costly mistake.

Fifth, pragmatism versus purity. At the moment, Democrats seem divided between electability and ideology. A new Gallup Poll this week found that 39 percent of Democrats prefer a nominee they agree with on almost all issues, while 58 percent prefer a nominee who can beat Donald Trump
. Candidates who can project viability on both factors will win the debate.
Most importantly, the Democratic Party debates will be much like the early weeks of spring training in baseball. Some players may get cut, but there remains a long way to go and lots of work to do before the World Series.

The splashy announcement of the reelection campaign of our current president and the highly anticipated Democratic Party debates have filled the news headlines. In one sense, especially for those susceptible to attack ad fatigue, this is all painfully soon. But in another respect, it is not a moment too soon. The nation has truly important business to do. Unfortunately, the conversation thus far has focused on the trivial. It needs to move to the essential. Our dialogue centers on arguably political questions. Should the United States replace capitalism with socialism? By the way, before we do, what is that? Should the government start mass deportation of undocumented immigrants?
We are concerned that the political is displacing the critical. Think about what our elected leaders could be doing. Our position within the global economy is eroding. Our collective prosperity is growing too slowly, and our world leadership is challenged by other countries. Many Americans are rightly frustrated their living standards have been stagnant while they have played by the rules, and in too many instances, their children are lined up to be stuck in their footprints. Our nation has made far too little progress in educating and training our young people. The perception of dead ends to workers carrying volumes of student debt is demoralizing and leaves too many citizens with little hope and little realistic ambition.
Meanwhile, our nation is losing its influence over behavioral standards in commerce. All Americans certainly want their fellow countrymen to lead better lives. If we believe that our moral leadership will bring fair play in the global market, with the United States and all countries prospering and contributing in a virtuous circle to greater health and wealth everywhere, then we need to work to maintain our prestige and position on the world stage. China challenges not only our prosperity but also our values, and we must lead to maintain the rules and standards of a fair global economy.
Much of the root of our slow growth economy rests in a short term policy focus. If our incomes individually and collectively are not growing fast enough, then we must siphon off too much for consumption to maintain our standards of living today. The shrinking remaining savings leave too little to build for the future and create a vicious cycle. Our nation has eroding infrastructure, a failing educational system, and lagging research budgets for technology. Workers have inadequate retirement savings spread too thinly over an unsustainable Social Security program. No wonder so many Americans fear for their futures and for their children.

Fixing these problems will take money. The sum of available public funds is negative. Before we can think of investing in education, infrastructure, or research and development, we must mend a budget that is turning out a mountain of debt. A primary cause of this wound is the cost of health care, over which we have one of several irreconcilable public conflicts. One side wants to repeal the system with no available replacement, while the other wants to replace the system with another that will cost far more. Washington cannot bring itself to raise its debt limit to prevent default, or to fund the federal government to prevent the disruption of a shutdown.
These enormous challenges should motivate our nation in much the same way as the perils of past world wars did our forebears. Our citizens today are Americans just as much as those who rose up together during those past crises. Unfortunately, our elected leaders today bicker over their own political futures instead of that of our nation. So bring on the debates. But debate what matters instead of what panders. We urge our fellow citizens to look up toward the horizon rather than down in the political gutter, and demand debate and decisions that build a better nation for the long haul.

turned the world of fiscal discipline on its head with her threat to throw the federal government into default if her demands for budget busting new spending were not met, what is truly remarkable about this development is not her threat, but the silence of the public commentariat in failing to properly respond to it. Do none of the usual suspects recognize the significance of her declaration?
If Pelosi has her way, federal spending will never go down, the budget deficit will never be closed, and our children and grandchildren could spend their entire lives paying off the tens of trillions of dollars worth of public debt that we leave behind to them. Unless demographic trends reverse themselves, that means more and more of our children and grandchildren will be enjoying less and less of the American dream.
Speaking to reporters about the need to raise the legal borrowing limit of the federal government, Pelosi said, “When we lift the caps then we can talk about lifting the debt ceiling, that would have to come second or simultaneous, but not before lifting the caps.” The caps she refers to are the spending limits enacted into law as a result of the Budget Control Act. Pelosi will allow the House to vote to increase the debt ceiling only after her negotiating adversaries, Senate Republicans and President Trump
, succumb to her demand for tens of billions of dollars in new spending.
What is remarkable is that in doing so, Pelosi has turned the world of fiscal discipline upside down. The vote to increase the debt ceiling is a vote no member of Congress wants to take because it is embarrassing. It is even humiliating for some because it reveals the failure of Congress to maintain its fiscal house in order. If Congress would stick with a budget and spend no more than it takes in, it would not need to raise the debt ceiling, and it therefore would not need to vote to raise the debt ceiling.
But we make them do it anyway, on a regular basis, just to remind them of their unwillingness or inability to make the hard choices necessary to keep spending within budget limits. In that sense, the regular vote to raise the debt ceiling is not a wall that prevents excess spending. It is really nothing more than a speed bump on the road to excess spending. But at least it is a speed bump, and that is better than nothing against reckless spending.
Over the last four decades, lawmakers have bitten the bullet about half the time and voted to increase the debt ceiling with some form of paired legislation that showed Congress acknowledging it needed to do a better job of maintaining fiscal discipline. The Budget Control Act, for instance, was signed into law in 2011. This raised the debt ceiling even as it set in place a complicated set of guidelines to achieve significant spending and debt reductions in the coming years. In fact, spending in future years was actually reduced by a larger amount than the debt ceiling was increased.

It was a bill no one liked, but the leaders of both parties in both chambers voted for it, including Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Now comes Pelosi, who apparently believes that if she just pretends not to have voted for the Budget Control Act, then no one will recall that she did. Perlosi not only refuses to adhere to the traditional rules of the game, but instead demands that the order be reversed and that we should first go beyond the current law, the one that she voted for, and enact new higher spending limits before we can actually consider the embarrassing vote necessary to ensure the United States can avoid a government default.
Pelosi is gambling that she can get away with her spending maneuver because public concern over growing deficits has fallen in recent years. That is indeed a risky gamble. Even with lower public concern than five years ago, 48 percent of respondents in a Pew Research Center survey this year believe that reducing the budget deficit should be a priority for our leaders in Washington. In other words, Pelosi just gave Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Trump a really big cudgel in their spending negotiations. Now we wait to see if they pick it up and use it.

0,06/18/19 04:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/449145-big-government-costs-the-little-guy,Big government costs the little guy,"Big government is expensive. It is so expensive, in fact, that no matter how much you soak them, even the rich cannot afford it. Progressives in the United States hold out Europe as a model for caring governance. They talk a lot about the benefits of universal health care, subsidized college, mandatory leave, and other “generous” government initiatives. They rarely mention the costs and never discuss who will pay for these proposals.
Turns out, it is not just the rich who pay the freight for the welfare state. Across Europe, even below average income earners are heavily taxed to pay for big government. When European workers start earning more than just two-thirds of the average wage, about half of every dollar they earn above that amount is taken away by the government, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. They also pay an additional 20 percent value added tax. In the United States, that same taxpayer pays a 32 percent marginal wage tax and a 6 percent sales tax.
It may not feel like it, but compared to the European welfare nations, the United States is a low tax country, and that is a good thing. It means that Americans get to keep more money they earn to spend as they wish, but that gladsome state may not actually last. If Congress fails to curb federal spending, it will ultimately have to raise taxes on low income and middle income Americans. Taxes on the rich will not cover the cost of existing programs, much less pay trillions of dollars for new programs, from the Green New Deal to Medicare for All, touted by politicians on the far left.
In the most optimistic scenario, the revenue raisers trumpeted by these progressives, which are a wealth tax, a financial transaction tax, and an extreme 70 percent top income tax rate, would bring “only” an additional $300 billion each year into Treasury coffers. That is about a third of the current budget deficit, 15 percent of the likely budget deficit in 10 years, and just 6 percent of the new federal spending called for by prominent progressives. The everyday rhetoric about raising taxes on the rich is only half the political story. Income tax history shows that, while it starts with narrow taxes on the rich, it soon leads to broad taxes on everyone else.
As tax historian Joseph Thorndike notes, high marginal income tax rates in the New Deal era were used “to help justify regressive consumption taxes on alcohol and tobacco.” Those regressive consumption taxes funded up to half the federal government in the 1930s. In the 1940s, top income tax rates hit 94 percent, but they were paired with dramatic tax increases on the middle class. The high tax rates for the wealthy gave political cover for Congress to shrink the lowest tax bracket, cutting the threshold for paying a higher rate in half. Meanwhile, those remaining in the lowest tax bracket saw their rates rise from less than 5 percent in 1940 to 23 percent by 1944. Average tax rates for the bottom 90 percent of income earners increased from 0 percent to more than 6 percent during the same period of time.
Europe already imposes high taxes on below average income workers. In France, single workers earning two-thirds of the average wage hand over 43 percent of their potential income to their government. The tax rate on additional income they earn, known as their marginal tax, is 70 percent. Things are no better in Germany, where below average income workers pay an average wage tax of 45 percent and a marginal tax of 56 percent.

The trend is clear. Big governments tend to tax lower income workers at higher rates. If American fiscal policy continues to follow in the footsteps of Europe, such higher taxes will invariably follow. Those higher taxes have significant economic costs, reducing opportunity and prosperity for all workers. One reason Europeans work less and are less entrepreneurial than Americans is because if they work any harder or put in longer hours, they would get to keep only half of those extra earnings, which then get taken away again by a 20 percent value added tax when they spend it.
Americans still have a choice. By not adding any new spending programs and reforming the largest drivers of future deficits, which are Medicare, Medicaid, ObamaCare, and Social Security, it will be possible to balance the budget and begin paying down the debt. The Heritage Foundation “Blueprint for Balance” presents a roadmap for fiscal responsibility that would balance the budget in 10 years or less without raising taxes. The progressive roadmap would take us on a different path that begins with sharply higher taxes on the rich and ends with heavy taxes on everyone.

0,06/15/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/448711-oberlin-college-case-shows-how-universities-are-losing-their-way,Oberlin College case shows how universities are losing their way,"For many who lament the shift from academics to activism across college campuses in the United States, Oberlin College in Ohio is the equivalent of the “China syndrome” during nuclear accidents, a point where chain reactions become impossible to stop or control. Oberlin students often find new issues to protest, even on one of the most liberal campuses in the world, like objections to serving sushi as cultural appropriation. As on other campuses across the country, these protests are encouraged by an array of faculty members and ever accommodating administrators.
This week, however, the bill came due for Oberlin when a jury awarded over $11 million in damages to a family bakery for being defamed as racist by its college students and officials. That motion was later followed by a whopping $33 million punitive award. It is only the latest example of how faculty members and officials are driving their institutions toward financial and intellectual bankruptcy, thanks to their advocacy or acquiescence.
The latest controversy began with a shoplifting case. In 2016, an African American student named Jonathan Aladin was caught trying to steal a bottle of wine from Gibson’s Bakery, which was established in 1885 and has been closely tied to the college for over a century. When the grandson of the owner tried to stop Aladin, a fight ensued and police were called. Aladin and two other students, Cecilia Whettstone and Endia Lawrence, were arrested. Students, professors, and administrators held protests, charging that the bakery was racist and profiled the three students.
Oberlin maintains in court filings that the son and grandson of the owners of Gibson’s Bakery “violently and unreasonably attacked” an unarmed student, but that is not how the police viewed it. Aladin was charged with robbery, which is a second degree felony, and Whettstone and Lawrence were charged with first degree misdemeanor assault. Police rejected claims of a racial motive and noted that, over a period of five years, 40 adults were arrested for shoplifting at Gibson’s Bakery, but only six were African American. It also is not how the court viewed it. When prosecutors cut a plea deal to reduce the charge to attempted theft, a local judge refused. He said the plea deal appeared to be the result of a permanent “economic sanction” by the college in which the victim had little choice but to relent. Ultimately, all three students pleaded guilty.
The merits of the case did not seem to bother Oberlin officials or student protesters. Dean of students Meredith Raimondo reportedly joined the massive protests and even handed out a flier denouncing the bakery as a racist business. When some people contacted Oberlin to object that the students admitted guilt, special assistant to the president for community and government relations Tita Reed wrote that it did not change a “damn thing” for her. Reed also reportedly participated in the campus protests.
Other faculty members encouraged students who denounced the bakery. The chairman of Africana studies posted, “Very proud of our students!” Oberlin barred purchases from the bakery, pending its investigation into whether this was “a pattern and not an isolated incident.” Raimondo also pressured Bon Appetit, a major contractor with the college, to cease business with the bakery. Reed even suggested that “once charges are dropped, orders will resume” and added that she was “baffled by their combined audacity and arrogance to assume the position of victim.”
It would be a statement that came back to haunt the college, in seeking to avoid punitive damages by arguing that the financial loss was too great for a small school, a sentiment that escaped these officials in hammering a small bakery. Owner David Gibson had discussed the ruinous impact of the boycott with college president Marvin Krislov and Raimondo received little sympathy. He said the two officials demanded that the bakery not call police when students shoplifted for the first time. Gibson objected that his bakery loses a large amount of money to shoplifting and that the college was demanding the equivalent of a first time “shoplifter pass.”
Not all Oberlin faculty members were silent in opposition to the boycott and protests. Theater professor Roger Copeland spoke publicly against the treatment of the bakery, but a livid vice president for communications Ben Jones responded to colleagues in a text message with an expletive against Copeland. Raimondo replied saying she would “unleash the students” if she was not convinced “this needs to be put behind us.”
The Oberlin case creates a troubling precedent for other institutions in higher education. Students certainly have the right to protest, and their views of a business can be a matter of opinion. However, if colleges are subject to damages for protests, they could resume efforts to curtail free speech. But this case turned on the actions of key officials who were viewed by the jury as encouraging, if not leading, the attacks. The college will appeal and, at a minimum, the $33 million award will be reduced to a $22 million limit under state law. While this may have amounted to record punitive damages against a college for defamation, it is not that unique.
Across the country, academics have caused lasting damage to their institutions by failing to stand up to, or actively supporting, extreme demands for speech codes, limits on academic freedom, and tenure changes. In Washington, Evergreen State College faculty members supported students who mobbed biology professor Bret Weinstein in a disturbing confrontation outside his office. The result was a significant $500,000 settlement with Weinstein and a major decline in applications. The University of Missouri experienced a similar meltdown on campus after assistant professor Melissa Click led attacks on a student journalist during heated protests in 2015. The university sought to accommodate protesters as applications plummeted and entire dorms were closed.
Other colleges have been hit with damages from students denied basic due process rights after being accused of sexual assault or harassment. While such rulings are mounting across the country, officials continue to ignore them and refuse to allow minimal rights for accused students. An even greater cost of acquiescence can be seen in reduced academic quality. Students increasingly demand changes based solely on the race or gender of authors, like Yale University students objecting that a course on English classics only included white authors like William Shakespeare.

We are reaching a critical point in higher education in the United States where leaders are ceding control to a small group of activist students and faculty members. Too often, those challenges are met not with acts of conscience but with cowardice. Professors fear being labeled as either insensitive or racist for objecting to protests or changes on campus.
Meanwhile, the costs mount with no reflection from administrators. Even with $44 million in total damages, Raimondo remains dean of students, and the college remains unapologetic. Oberlin was founded in 1833 on the belief that it is “peculiar in that which is good.” What happened at Gibson’s Bakery was neither good for Oberlin nor for higher education.

0,06/13/19 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/448353-can-joe-biden-beat-donald-trump,Can Joe Biden beat Donald Trump?,"Unemployment sits under 4 percent and the economy continues to grow, but voters are dissatisfied. Polls show President Trump
down by double digits against former Vice President Joe Biden
. As for other Democratic contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Sanders, the numbers reflect a foot race. For the moment, Quinnipiac University and Morning Consult polls signal that Biden winning in 2020 is now a plausible possibility.
Beyond the obvious, Trump has reason to worry. If Biden is elected, Trump would become the Republican counterpart to Jimmy Carter, a one and done president who was shown the door after his party held the reins of power for just a single term. Beyond that, if Trump is out of office after the election next year, he may yet feel the sting of criminal indictment. That is certainly not the way most folks envision spending their golden years.
However, let us not get too far ahead of things. Instead, let us look at the numbers, which do not augur well for the incumbent in a matchup against Biden, a son of the rustbelt and a man who wears his heart on his sleeve. Biden leads Trump by comfortable margins in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two states that Trump won in 2016, but that last went Republican in 1988.
If those were the only two states to flip in 2020, neither candidate would possess a majority of electoral votes, and Trump would likely be reelected as the result of the presidential race being thrown over to the House of Representatives to decide. Trump and his minions could take solace in a second term and “owning the libs” as they see it. Beyond that, our national fissures would become deeper and more acrimonious.
But that is not where the story ends, at least at this moment. Polls also show Biden leading in Texas by 4 points and in North Carolina by more than 10 points, and that is a very big deal. The Lone Star State last went Democratic when Carter squared off against Gerald Ford in 1976. As for the Tar Heel State, it too cast its lot with Carter back then, and it also lined up for Barack Obama in 2008. In other words, Biden has reason to smile.
Still, he should not bask in glory too much or too soon. First, Biden faces the challenge of emerging as the Democratic nominee, and from the looks of things that outcome is far from a foregone conclusion. Biden leads the field nationally, as well as in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which will host the first four nominating contests. Biden also appears to be at the top in Massachusetts, home to Elizabeth Warren. No matter what any Biden rival may say publicly, those are impressive stats.
But early polls are no guarantee of ultimate success. In 2008, Hillary Clinton was the early favorite, until she was not. That same cycle, Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, went from the Republican front runner to one of the first candidates to exit the race. In 2016, there was the tale of woe told by Jeb Bush. Inevitability is fickle and fleeting.
Beyond that stand, there are the numerous Democratic Party rules and constituencies. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats bar “winner take all” primaries. Instead, delegates are awarded proportionally. Practically speaking, that opens the door to an elongated nominating season and to the possibility that the nomination will be decided until the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee next year. This leaves plenty of time for acrimony, demands, and grudges to accumulate and fester in the ranks.

Finally, there are the Democrats themselves. Who they choose as their standard bearer will be linked by one degree or another to their policy preferences and demographics. How important is Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and abortion to primary voters? How crucial is age to a party that nominated John Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama?
Then there are the debates. Bluntly, will Biden wilt under the heat of the stage lights or shrink in the face of likely attacks? Or will he dominate his competitors the way he schooled Paul Ryan in 2012? The bottom line is that Trump should not take anything for granted. He is loathed by many. As for Biden, it is too early to gloat. A lot can happen before next fall.

The practice is as old as our first campaigns. What is new and potentially lethal to an informed democracy are the emergence of deepfake technologies.
A recent doctored video was designed to show Speaker Nancy Pelosi
slurring her words. The video was a high technology hatchet job. Despite far and wide rebuttal, the video still gained ground and was mentioned in various media reports. Facebook refused to ban the video altogether.
The Pelosi video is not technically a deepfake. It is merely a deceptive alteration of the speed of the original recording. Still, people fell for it. If they will fall for crude editing, then they have no chance to avoid being suckered by deepfakes. The technology advances rapidly. Samsung showed that its artificial intelligence technology can create a deepfake with a single photo by using an example of the Mona Lisa brought to life.
Political candidates on the trail expect their remarks will be taken out of context and blown entirely out of proportion. Unintentional verbal gaffes indeed have the ability to send candidates veering into clarification and denial. But what if a candidate never actually uttered words used against him or her? How can anyone ever trust democracy when democratic elections are polluted by such digital fakery?
Next week, the House Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing on the issue of deepfakes. In addition to the Pelosi video, this follows testimony by National Intelligence Director Dan Coats and the annual Worldwide Threat Assessment, which warns that our adversaries and competitors will likely attempt to use deepfakes or similar technology to create convincing but false images and videos meant “to augment influence campaigns directed against the United States and our allies and partners.”
Committee Chairman Adam Schiff expressed the stakes at a discussion last month. “Deepfakes deeply impact the democratic process,” he told the Hollywood Reporter, “because this technology can be used to create enormous confusion in an election.” It is not just Democrats. Republican Senator Marco Rubio has also prominently warned about deepfakes, speaking on it at the Heritage Foundation and the Atlantic Council.

So where can we go from here? First, with a president who has rendered himself utterly unreliable on matters of truth, and has already questioned the authenticity of the verified Access Hollywood tape of his past lewd remarks, Congress must address the threat of deepfakes directly, as it is beginning to do. We need to determine the appropriate line to be taken with social media that both protects free speech and protects against the malicious spread of misinformation in our democracy by bad actors.
Beyond what the House Intelligence Committee hearing next week will reveal, we all have a fuller responsibility to engage civically and civilly and to ensure that our citizens can critically analyze the news and discern the big difference between reality and politically motivated fabrication.

0,06/01/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/446457-mueller-must-testify-publicly-to-answer-three-critical-questions,Mueller must testify publicly to answer three critical questions,"In that twinkling zone between man and myth, Robert Mueller
transcends the mundane. Even in refusing to reach a conclusion on criminal conduct, he is excused. As Mueller himself declared, we are to ask him no questions or expect any answers beyond his final report. But his motivations as special counsel can only be found within an approved range that starts at “selfless” and ends at “heroic.” Democratic Representative Mike Quigley of Illinois defended Mueller’s refusal to reach a conclusion as simply “protecting” President Trump
in a moment of “extreme fairness.”
Yet, as I noted previously, Mueller’s position on the investigation has become increasingly conflicted and, at points, unintelligible. As someone who defended Mueller’s motivations against the unrelenting attacks of Trump, I found his press conference to be baffling, and it raised serious concerns over whether some key decisions are easier to reconcile on a political rather than a legal basis. Three decisions stand out that are hard to square with Mueller’s image as an apolitical icon. If he ever deigns to answer questions, his legacy may depend on his explanations.
Refusal to identify grand jury material
Perhaps one of the most surprising disclosures by Attorney General William Barr
was that both he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein expressly told Mueller to submit his report with grand jury material clearly marked to facilitate the release of a public version. The Justice Department cannot release grand jury material without a court order. Mueller knew that. He also knew his people had to mark the material because they were in the grand jury proceedings.
Thus, Barr and Rosenstein reportedly were dumbfounded to receive a report that did not contain these markings. It meant the public report would be delayed by weeks as the Justice Department waited for Mueller to perform this basic task. Mueller knew it would cause such a delay as many commentators were predicting Barr would postpone the release of the report or even bury it. It left Barr and the Justice Department in the worst possible position and created the false impression of a coverup.
Why would a special counsel directly disobey his superiors on such a demand? There is no legal or logical explanation. What is even more galling is that Mueller said in his press conference that he believed Barr acted in “good faith” in wanting to release the full report. Barr ultimately did so, releasing 98 percent of the report to select members of Congress and 92 percent to the public. However, then came the letter from Mueller.
Surprise letter sent to the attorney general
Five days after submitting his report, Mueller sent a letter objecting that Barr’s summary letter to Congress “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the conclusions reached by his team. He complained “there is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.” The letter surprised Barr for good reasons.
First, Barr had offered to allow Mueller to read the summary before submitting it. Mueller declined but then sent this letter calling for the release of sections of his report, even though they had not been cleared by Justice Department staff. Second, Barr has known Mueller for decades. Yet, Mueller did not pick up the phone to discuss his concerns or to ask for a meeting. Instead, he undermined Barr with a letter to insinuate something improper without making such an accusation.
Mueller also requested something he knew Barr could not do, which is to release uncleared portions of the report, including material later redacted by Justice Department staff. His letter is notable in that it did not include an acknowledgment that he was responsible for the need for the summary, as well as much of the delay in releasing the report.
In an earlier meeting, Barr explained that he wanted to quickly release the report and allow the work of the special counsel to speak for itself. To do so, however, Mueller and his people needed to identify material that should be redacted under federal law, which they did not do. While Barr has described Mueller’s letter as “snitty,” it was in fact a sucker punch.
Refusal to reach an obstruction conclusion
The most curious and significant decision by Mueller was refusing to reach a conclusion on presidential obstruction. While ignored by the media, Mueller contradicted himself in first saying that he would have cleared Trump if he could have, but then later saying that he decided not to reach a conclusion on any crime. I have already addressed why his interpretation of memos from the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel is unprecedented and illogical. He concluded that, in barring the indictment of a sitting president, those memos meant prosecutors can investigate but not reach conclusions on possible criminal acts.
It is not just his legal interpretation that is incomprehensible. Mueller was appointed almost two years before he released his report. He was fully aware that Congress, the Justice Department, the media, and the public expected him to reach conclusions on criminal conduct, a basic function of a special counsel. He also was told he should do so by the attorney general and deputy attorney general. Yet, he relied on two controversial opinions by a small Justice Department office.
Over those two years, Mueller could have asked his superiors for a decision on this alleged policy barring any conclusions on criminal conduct. More importantly, he could have requested an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel. That is what it does, particularly when its own opinions are the cause of confusion. One would think you would be even more motivated to do so, if you intended to ignore the view of the attorney general and his deputy that there is no such policy.
Mueller, however, is an experienced litigator who knows not to ask a question when you do not know the answer or when you know the answer and do not want to hear it. His position is even more curious, given his lack of action after Barr and Rosenstein did precisely what he said could not be done under Justice Department policies. If Mueller truly believed such conclusions are impermissible, then why did he not submit the matter in question to the Justice Department inspector general?

His press conference captured his report perfectly. It was an effort to allude to possible crimes without, in fairness to the accused, clearly and specifically stating those crimes. Mueller knew that was incrimination by omission. By emphasizing he could not clear Trump of criminality, Mueller knew the press would interpret that move as a virtual indictment.
What is concerning is not that each of his three decisions clearly would undermine Trump or Barr but that his decisions ran against the grain for a special counsel. The law favored the other path in each instance. Thus, to use Mueller’s own construction, if we could rule out a political motive, we would have done so. This is why he must testify and do so publicly.

0,04/30/19 04:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/441395-why-the-old-equal-rights-amendment-is-not-viable,Why the old Equal Rights Amendment is not viable,"Equal Rights Amendment resolutions have been introduced in nearly every Congress since 1923. This session of Congress is no different. There was a hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment in the House today. Some will try to tell you that ratification is just around the corner. However, the Equal Rights Amendment they are talking about no longer exists. That has not stopped the Alice Paul Institute, for example, from talking up its own “three state strategy” for ratifying the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment.
It was put before the states and approved by 35 of the 38 states necessary for ratification. Nearly four decades later, activists persuaded Nevada and Illinois to ratify it, leaving the amendment just one state shy of being added to the Constitution. Or so the Equal Rights Amendment activists would like you to believe. But it just is not so. Here are five reasons why the Equal Rights Amendment sent to the states in 1972 is no longer viable.
First, it left Congress with a deadline of seven years for state ratification. The clock ran out on the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment with 35 states on board. The activists want you to ignore that fact. Second, Congress later passed and President Carter signed in 1978 an extension to 1982. The activists want you to ignore that deadline too. The Congressional Research Service notes that this extension actually “suggests that an unending ratification period may not be permissible.”In other words, the extension that Equal Rights Amendment supporters sought in 1978 undercuts their position today that both ratification deadlines are invalid. Moreover, no additional states ratified the Equal Rights Amendment between 1979 and the end of the extended ratification deadline in 1982.
Third, five states that initially ratified the Equal Rights Amendment wound up rescinding their approval before the original deadline of seven years. Activists claim the rescissions are invalid and should be ignored, but it is not that simple. Article V of the Constitution provides that amendments may be proposed by a convention called by Congress “on the application of the legislatures to two thirds of the several states.” It has been debated whether a state may make and then rescind a convention application.
Many of the same groups endorsing the Equal Rights Amendment signed a letter last month urging state legislatures to “rescind any application”for an Article V convention. Three of the five states that had rescinded their Equal Rights Amendment ratification in the 1970s later rescinded their applications for an Article V convention. It is hard to argue that states may change their minds about convention but not a proposed amendment.
Fourth, Equal Rights Amendment activists like to point out that the 27th Amendment, the most recent addition to the Constitution, was proposed in 1789 but not finally ratified until May 1992. What is the 47 years since Congress sent the Equal Rights Amendment to the states, they ask, as compared to the 203 years between proposal and ratification of the 27th Amendment? On this issue, however, there is a distinction with a very big difference in that the 27th Amendment had no ratification deadline.
Fifth, several court decisions undermine the notion that the Equal Rights Amendment sent to the states in 1972 is still alive. The Supreme Court decided Dillon versus Gloss in 1921, two years before the first Equal Rights Amendment was proposed. As the Congressional Research Service had summarized it, the justices held that the “ratification of a constitutional amendment should occur within a reasonable time after the amendment is proposed.” That case involved the 18th Amendment which, like the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment, had a ratification deadline of seven years.
In the 1939 decision in Coleman versus Miller, the Supreme Court held that a variety of factors help determine a “reasonable time”to ratify an amendment to the Constitution. Most importantly, though, the justices said that Congress, not the courts, should make that decision. Congress did just that in 1972 and 1978, determining that a maximum of 10 years was enough to establish that three fourths of the states wanted the Equal Rights Amendment in the Constitution. The reality is that they did not.
In the 1982 decision in Idaho versus Freeman, a district court held that the original Equal Rights Amendment ratification deadline was constitutional. The deadline extension itself was unconstitutional, and the ratifications rescissions are valid. The Supreme Court vacated this decision when the 1982 ratification deadline passed and rendered the case moot. But the justices did not address the merits of the conclusions of the lower court.
Perhaps the activists will have better luck with the number of Equal Rights Amendment resolutions introduced this year. But it is simply fiction that the Equal Rights Amendment proposed during the 92nd Congress is still on the confirmation track today. It has been dead for at least 37 years.

So when The New York Times international edition published a cartoon over the weekend portraying Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
as a dog wearing a Star of David, its editors should not have been surprised at the outraged reaction to the controversy.
The New York Times is not some marginal newspaper that traditionally peddles bigoted cartoons. It is known for its careful editing and sensitivity concerning race and ethnicity. Its international edition is the American newspaper of record around the world, and particularly in Europe. So when it published a cartoon employing anti-Semitic tropes at a time of increasing anti-Semitism in Europe, that decision became newsworthy.
To be sure, the Times has now acknowledged that the decision was wrong and has apologized. But that is not enough. Its editors must explain how this bigoted cartoon made it into the print edition. Which editors approved its publication? What was their reasoning? Has there been accountability for what the Times acknowledges was a mistake? What steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of this?
The reason this a big deal is not only that this was published in the Times. It is also because the cartoon is a sign of the times. Both in Europe and the United States, but especially in Europe, we see a dangerous phenomenon of increasing tolerance, especially on the left, of anti-Semitic tropes, images, and stereotypes so long as they are directed against Israel.
Even some left-wing Jewish publications are not exempt from this virus. The Forward published an opinion piece justifying a crude cartoon that ran in the official University of California at Berkeley newspaper, depicting me as a predatory spider stomping on innocent Palestinians. The headline on the Forward column was “No, that Alan Dershowitz
cartoon wasn’t anti-Semitic.” The reason its editors gave is the cartoon is “true” because Israel does kill Palestinians and defenders of Israel, like me, are “deceptive.”
I am sure the editors of Der Sturmer, a Nazi propaganda tabloid published in Germany during World War II, offered similar justifications that there are some deceptive and violent Jews. The real issue, avoided by the Forward and by the Times editors who authorized publishing the cartoon, is the use of Der Sturmer type imagery dehumanizing Jews by depicting them as dogs and spiders that control the world by deception and violence.
Context is critically important. In Europe and in Berkeley, the context is increasing anti-Semitism that is deemed acceptable by many on the left as long as it is directed at the nation state of the Jewish people and its leaders and defenders. Today, Israel is the Jew among nations and has increasingly become the object of historic anti-Jewish stereotyping.
The distance between the offices of The New York Times international edition and the Chabad synagogue in San Diego, which a gunman attacked on Saturday, is growing smaller as the reach of the internet is growing larger. Both the extreme right and extreme left dehumanize Jews, and it is far easier to kill a dehumanized stereotype than a real person.
Jews have been killed by extremist right wingers and by extremist Muslims, but not by hard left haters, at least not yet. Why focus so much attention on the “benign” anti-Semitism of anti-Israel extremists on the hard left? For one obvious important reason: The violent anti-Semitism of the hard right, as represented by the murders of Jews at prayer in San Diego and Pittsburgh, is universally condemned by all decent people, including conservatives. The “benign” anti-Semitism of the hard left, which often is disguised as anti-Zionism, get a pass from many liberals.
Consider the anti-Semitic remarks of Representative Ilhan Omar
of Minnesota, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, South African bishop Desmond Tutu, or British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbin. Many liberals have defended them. Senator Bernie Sanders
of Vermont, who is among the worst offenders, actually went to London to show support for his fellow socialist Corbin despite the history of anti-Semitism by Corbin.
This tolerance for anti-Semitism from the left is most pronounced at universities, where our future leaders are studying. For that reason, hard left tolerance of anti-Semitism, disguised as anti-Zionism, is our future, unless we can stop it. Hard right anti-Semitic violence, no matter how destructive, is hopefully a discredited remnant of the dark past. Both are dangerous. But we cannot allow the condemned violence of hard right anti-Semites to close our eyes to the tolerated hard left anti-Semitism.
We cannot wait until some nut with a gun is incited to violence by a dehumanizing left wing cartoon depicting Jews as dogs and spiders.

announced Saturday that he will not run for reelection amid a rash of infighting at the gun rights group's annual meeting.
“Please know I hoped to be with you today as NRA president endorsed for reelection. I’m now informed that that will not happen,” North said in a letter read at the NRA’s national convention by Richard Childress, the group’s first vice president.

The announcement comes less than a day after bombshell reports surfaced in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal detailing a leadership struggle between North and NRA CEO and Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre.
The reports revealed a letter LaPierre sent to the NRA board alleging that North was extorting him and pressuring him to resign over allegations of financial misdeeds. In his own letter, North said he was looking out for the NRA’s best interests and that he was forming a crisis committee to probe internal financial matters. 
The clash between North and LaPierre is playing out amid the group's annual national convention in Indianapolis. President Trump
traveled to Indiana to address the gathering of gun rights advocates on Friday before returning to Washington.
The feud between the top NRA officials is reportedly rooted in a larger row between the gun rights group and Ackerman McQueen, its advertising firm, which led the NRA to file a lawsuit earlier this month.
The NRA says Ackerman McQueen has refused to provide records to support its billings, while the advertising firm ripped the lawsuit as “frivolous” and “inaccurate.” The NRA is seeking details regarding Ackerman McQueen’s contract with North. The firm produces a documentary program on NRATV hosted by North.
The NRA executive vice president claimed that while the advertising firm paid North millions of dollars annually for the documentary program, only three episodes have been produced so far.
LaPierre revealed in his letter a phone conversation between North and a senior NRA staffer this week in which North said Ackerman McQueen was preparing to send a letter to the board that would be “bad for me, two other members of my executive team and the Association.”
LaPierre reportedly wrote that the letter in question “would contain a devastating account of our financial status, sexual harassment charges against a staff member, accusations of wardrobe expenses and excessive staff travel expenses.” He added that after the call “others informed me that I needed to withdraw the NRA lawsuit against [Ackerman McQueen] or be smeared.”
He added that he was informed that Ackerman McQueen would not send the damaging letter if he resigned.
“Without notice to the board, the NRA filed a lawsuit against Ackerman McQueen. In addition, a series of articles in The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times were alleged of financial mismanagement by senior NRA officers. If true, the NRA nonprofit status is threatened,” North said of the dispute to the NRA in Saturday’s letter.
North, whose term ends Monday, said he joined the NRA as president at LaPierre’s urging.
“In spring of 2018, NRA EVP and CEO Wayne LaPierre urged me to retire from my job at Fox News, become the president and [accept] a salary position with Ackerman McQueen, so I agreed to do so in order to help build the NRA membership and resources,” he said. 
The 76-member NRA board will likely seek to work to resolve the new leadership vacuum when it meets on Monday."
0,04/25/19 02:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/440645-never-underestimate-joe-biden,Never underestimate Joe Biden,"Former Vice President Joe Biden
is statistically tied for second among New Hampshire Democrats with South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg
of Indiana. Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders
, who leads Biden and Buttigieg in the Granite State, announced that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber, should have the right to vote from federal prison along with garden variety murderers and rapists. This would put Sanders oddly in sync with Israel, where voting from behind bars is legal.
From the looks of things, the 2020 Democratic primaries will pick up where the 2016 Democratic convention left off. For Biden, that poses a potentially insoluble challenge. Biden is a septuagenarian nonsocialist in a party whose base is trending leftward and whose demographics are turning young and polychromatic. If Sanders is the Howard Beale of the Democratic field, the mad as hell television commentator of the 1976 movie “Network” and Mayor Pete is Beto 2.0, the freshest face this cycle, then Biden is the uncle you are happiest to see at Thanksgiving, the one with the jokes whose kids actually like him, and whose wife smiles through unclenched teeth. He is also the older relative who grieves over a child who died way too soon, for whom the loss is palpable and still fresh.
All this would be an unalloyed plus for Biden if the Democrats were getting ready for a family reunion, but that is not the case. Instead, the Democrats are itching to impeach a first term president while counting down to Election Day, even if the odds of impeachment resulting in the removal of Donald Trump
from office are zero. In the aftermath of the special counsel report and the contorted attempt by Attorney General William Barr
at performance art, the job approval rating of the president is again falling, while impeachment support is also declining.
Yet, Democratic hopefuls Elizabeth Warren
and Kamala Harris
are pushing impeachment from their side in the Senate. Over in the House, firebrand freshmen Rashida Tlaib
and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
are by no means alone. Even as a plurality of independents give impeachment a thumbs down, nearly three-fifths of Democrats approve of starting the process. In other words, Democratic stridency is another potential obstacle for Biden.
Less than a decade ago, Biden played Mitch McConnell
whisperer in the Obama White House for the cunning Kentuckian, and had kind words for his successor Mike Pence
, who like Biden has a son who served in the military. Said differently, Nancy Pelosi
can rule her caucus with her fixed gaze and a near iron fist, but primary voters march to their own beat.
The Democratic primary system is another headache. Under party rules, convention delegates are awarded proportionally, and “winner take all” primaries are barred. Hillary Clinton
only clinched the nomination in early summer 2016. With the outcome of the Democratic nomination potentially in doubt until convention balloting begins in Milwaukee, passion and cash stand to rule, and Biden may be lacking on both counts. Still, do not count Biden out. Right now, he is sitting atop the Democratic pack nationally, and he is more than a niche player. There is a reason that Biden speaks to firefighters and union members. He likes them and they like him back.
Biden runs well among working class and minority voters, unlike Buttigieg, who generates excitement but whose core supporters are reminiscent of those of Gary Hart, Michael Dukakis, and George McGovern. Those core supporters are largely white voters with a college degree. By the same measure, Biden does not turn off wealthier Democrats and those with a college degree, unlike Sanders. For some Democrats, the term “socialist” is not positive, especially if they live in the shadows of Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Back in 2016, Sanders lost the New York primary against Clinton, and it was not just because Clinton owns a home in Chappaqua.
In head to head polling against the president, Biden consistently leads. But if you cannot win the nomination, the case for electability becomes quickly moot. For Biden and the rest of the Democratic candidates, the contours of the primaries will soon emerge. In fact, they already are.

0,04/24/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/440375-this-is-the-joe-biden-you-rarely-see,This is the Joe Biden you rarely see,"This week, Joe Biden
is set to announce his candidacy for president. Forgive me for getting ahead of the punditry clutter with this story.
Meetings in the Oval Office with President Obama and Vice President Biden to discuss Democratic House races were always thrilling. Notably, the body language was instructive. The president would sit straight in his chair, cerebral and analytical, absorbing the analysis I presented as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The vice president would hunch forward with his arms outstretched, as if waiting to dive into one of the districts and campaign there himself.
At one such meeting in 2011, I was struggling to concentrate. My dad, who was living in Arizona, had just received a diagnosis of lung cancer. The prognosis was not good. On the way to the White House, I stopped to pick up a “get well” card. My plan was to ask the president to sign it. My dad was a fervent Democrat, and perhaps one of the only Democrats in the retirement community of Ahwatukee Foothills in Phoenix.
After the meeting, I asked the president to sign the card. To my chagrin, he nodded no, then went to his desk, pulled out a drawer, grabbed a piece of stationery, and wrote a personal note. As I left, Biden asked me to join him in his West Wing office. I thought we were going to review maps of competitive districts. Instead, he said, “Your dad’s condition is going to one of the hardest things your mom will go through. I’d like to call her.”
I hesitated. My mother is, well, talkative. So is Biden. I warned him that it might be the longest call in White House history. Then I gave him the phone number and watched as he waited to connect. Seconds letter, he said, “Mrs. Israel, this is Joe Biden.” Then there was a moment of silence followed by a quizzical expression. My assumption was that my mother immediately launched into a monologue with the vice president of the United States, whom she had never met in person or talked with before.
After a few seconds, Biden said, “Hello? Are you there?” Then he broke out laughing. My mother thought it was a robocall and was waiting for the rest of the message. It was a poignant conversation of 10 minutes sharing war stories, the war in this case being cancer. Then he hung up. My mother could not stop talking about that talk. For weeks, then months, she would remind me of when “Joe called me.” Then with the passage of time and the death of my father in August 2012, my mother stopped telling the story.
That was the case until it emerged again in the first week of January 2013. “Joe called,” she told me during a phone conversation. I said, “I know, mom. That was a couple of years ago.” She said, “No. He called on New Years Day. He told me that the first day of a new year without someone you love is hard, and he called to tell me he was thinking about me.”
I had no idea he called. That is the point of this true story. Many politicians might have made that phone call, and they would have let me know about it as a subtle way of claiming some credit for the effort. Not Biden. He called my mother not because her son was a member of Congress, but because she was struggling. He called not to take credit, but simply to make her feel better. It was not out of obligation but out of his humanity.
This is not a political endorsement, although not that such things matter. Wrapping oneself in the political endorsement of a former member of Congress has all the value of being wrapped in a worn vintage coat. Instead, this is a glimpse of a man who never forgot the struggle of a woman who had lost her husband, but did not feel compelled to crow about it to their son. That silence speaks volumes about Joe Biden.

Is she a dupe doing “rope a dope” for President Trump
, or is there something larger and more sinister at stake? The answer is probably between those two choices, however, allow me to unpack something that I believe is fundamentally important to how we govern and how we protect the right of the public to know and the obligation of the government to tell.
Let me stipulate that serving as press secretary to the president of the United States is by no means an easy gig. That is precisely the reason few of them last more than two and a half years. I did four years on behalf of President Clinton and, while it was the most interesting and challenging job I will ever have, it did have rather zesty moments that taxed my patience, and no doubt that of the White House press corps as well.
We call the interaction between government officials and politicians and the press corps an “adversarial relationship” because it is. However, I believed “adversarial” could also be “amicable.” There are, we hope, professionals on both sides of the podium in the White House briefing room who are committed to seeking the truth, telling the truth, reporting the truth, and letting the American people decide. My old boss, the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, was fond of saying to his staff, “We are all entitled to our own opinions, but not to our own facts.”
The search for truth and understanding darkens when anyone knowingly leads the American people away from the cold hard facts. That is true for people who speak on behalf of presidents and also true for journalists and pundits who embellish their reports and commentaries to attract eyeballs and audiences that boost ratings and jazz up the Washington chit chat.
Sanders, according to a brief snippet in the report by special counsel Robert Mueller
, admits she made up a fact that “countless” FBI employees supported the decision of Trump to fire FBI Director James Comey
. She confided to investigators that this was a mere “slip of the tongue” in “the heat of the moment.” To be fair, I probably slipped my tongue, too, in some rather heated moments in the first term of the Clinton presidency.
But the White House press secretary has an unerring obligation to keep all sides of government officials and journalists aimed toward the truth and not away from it. In the West Wing, the office of the press secretary is equidistant from the Briefing Room where the press secretary jousts with journalists and the Oval Office where the president hopefully provides the right information on how to answer questions accurately and honestly.
That all seems a little quaint in the age of Trump. I find it hard to imagine that there is a commitment to getting accurate and useful information to the public within a White House that revels in declaring the free press, protected by our First Amendment by the way, the “enemy of the people.” Such a retort, more worthy of Joseph Stalin than Thomas Jefferson, invites hostility if not violence to those who bring truth to the American people.
So Sanders lied. Is that acceptable? Very few circumstances in which a press secretary can say something untrue come to mind. First, you have to protect people who are in danger. In 1980, White House press secretary Jody Powell knowingly lied about an attempt to rescue United States diplomats being held hostage in Iran. He was protecting the operational security of a mission that ultimately failed. Powell took enormous grief for this decision but, till his dying day, he defended his decision and so do I.
Second, you sometimes have to tell the truth slowly, as I once said. The circumstances were a planned cruise missile attack aimed at decapitating the leadership of Osama bin Laden’s terrorist organization in August 1998. That attack failed because the leaders left before the missiles arrived. I had been asked that morning if the press could have the day off because we were in Martha’s Vineyard for a Clinton family vacation. I dissembled a bit and said “let me check a few things” before we called it quits for the day so the press could go golfing or to the beach. Little did they know the president would arrive in an hour to declare that we had just gone to war.
Third, sometimes you have to put reportable facts in the best possible light to provide “spin” to protect the political interests of the president. But “spin” and “prevarication” can cross lines easily, and that is the danger zone for those who seek the truth. That is where Sanders transgresses. Service to the president and to the truth are not always the same thing. Knowing where the balance is becomes the most difficult part of the job.
Someone must stand and be held accountable every day for answering questions and providing information to the public. Preparing for daily press briefings is hard but necessary work. Failing to conduct regular press briefings is an abomination, and there should be more outrage about this. Getting our federal agencies and departments to provide information is also a demand of the job. I browbeat Cabinet officials for information and got backed up by Clinton and his chiefs of staff, who told Cabinet secretaries that they needed to be attentive to all my requests.
Finally, we need some humor and gentleness in this exchange. It is not combat. That is why declaring the press to be the “enemy of the people” is so ultimately destructive. This is about making a democracy work. We should all lighten up but let everyone do the job they are obligated to do on something other than a war footing. I doubt much can change in this worn down administration. But there are many people now seeking to be the next president. We must demand that accountability and daily press briefings be one of the commitments they make when seeking office.

in her second stint as the Speaker of the House were an unmitigated and unproductive disaster. This mark of 100 days is a traditional point at which to assess the strength of a new party in power. While the Democrats hit this landmark the other day, they reached it with nary a feckless whimper and without proving anything but their own disunity and ineffectiveness in policy.
The only significant legislation for which House Democrats have been able to secure any notable Republican support was the joint resolution to rescind the national emergency declaration by President Trump
for the southern border. It was summarily vetoed and accomplished precisely nothing. The Democrats themselves prompted the national emergency declaration with their steadfast refusal to fund essential border barriers to combat the worsening crisis on the southern border, and their inability to override his veto means they are now in a worse position than before.
Even the purely symbolic bills, such as the Green New Deal and the Big Tech handout deceptively known as the Save the Internet Act, that Pelosi and her caucus have passed with the full knowledge that they would have no chance of becoming law are thin gruel. Despite the excuses about controlling only one chamber of Congress, this is an embarrassing record. The first time Pelosi became Speaker of the House in 2007, she enjoyed a Senate controlled by her fellow Democrats while she had to contend, as she does today, with a Republican president at the helm.
Nevertheless, Pelosi came roaring out of the gate that year, passing a whole host of liberal legislative priorities, including a minimum wage increase and “pay as you go” budgeting, not just in the first 100 days, but in the first 100 legislative hours of her term as Speaker of the House. Moreover, most of that legislation passed the Senate and was signed into law by President George Bush. The same can also be said for the last Republican Speaker of the House under similar circumstances. In the first 100 days of 2011, when John Boehner
stepped into the same position Pelosi now occupies, he managed to extend the tax cuts that were a central element of the legislative legacy of Bush, even with President Obama in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate.
By stark contrast, the second time around for Pelosi has accomplished effectively nothing so far. The reasons should be clear enough. In addition to the president, the Republican majority in the Senate, and an electorate that is not particularly impressed by the increasingly radical Democratic agenda, Pelosi has had to contend with an openly socialist left wing that already tried to stop her from becoming Speaker of the House again.
Piloted by the increasingly unpopular darlings of the far left, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
and Ilhan Omar
, the radical division of the caucus is thwarting efforts by Pelosi and the more responsible Democrats to actually govern. With help from the media, Democrats are trying to spin her tenure as some kind of resounding success. On top of taking a victory lap without winning anything, Pelosi told “60 Minutes” about her restless socialist members by citing the diminutive presence of “like five people.”
CBS took this at face value and gave her one of the greatest softball interviews in recent memory. Lesley Stahl gushed all throughout her questioning, calling Pelosi “one of the very few people who stood up to” President Trump and won. Complete with shiny graphics from the online storefront selling “patron saint of shade” shirts, the show applauded Pelosi on her disgraceful displays during the State of the Union Address back in February. Still gushing, Stahl described Pelosi as “like a giant slayer.”
Unfortunately for Pelosi and her supporters, no amount of favorably biased media treatment can cover for her actual record of failure. The Democratic House majority has already scuttled itself, ceding any real leadership and governance to President Trump and the White House.

0,04/20/19 03:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/439755-reports-of-populisms-demise-were-premature,Predictions of populism's demise were premature,"Not so long ago, many commentators saw the election victories of French President Emmanuel Macron
, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as a sign that the ""populist advance"" had come to an end.
That turned out to be premature. Now, five out of the 10 largest economies (the U.S. China, India, Brazil and Italy) in the world, which jointly account for two-thirds of the global economy, are led by populists or, in China's case, an autocrat.  
The as yet non-populist five
The other five economies all face considerable problems. Japanese growth has been low for decades, the country has humongous debts, and its population is ageing at speed. On top of this, some fear that PM Shinzo Abe will eventually prioritise his nationalist disposition over Japan's economic needs.
Germany's Angela Merkel is on her final lap as chancellor. Her intended successor will not initiate any revolutionary shifts, which is dangerous in itself. Together, the two traditional mainstream parties are weaker than ever.
Economic growth is slowing significantly, and quite a few economists have warned that politicians have become complacent in recent years instead of addressing the weaknesses of the German economy.
The U.K. is fighting a multi-headed dragon in Brexit. British businesses are feeling the pain of constant uncertainty, and important reforms have fallen by the wayside.
The Tories are deeply divided. Labour is also at odds with itself. Its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, with his left-wing populist ideas, is the business sector's worst nightmare.
Meanwhile, 90 percent of the population thinks that Brexit is being handled in a way that humiliates the country. The protracted divorce drama does nothing for the U.K.'s reputation or for Europe's political clout.
In France, the ""yellow vest"" protests have undermined Macron's position.
Canadian PM Justin Trudeau
has been the favorite of progressives, but he is now part of a scandal that creates the impression that the PM may have been trying to stop an investigation into the corrupt practices of a large Canadian company.
Wobbly Europe
One half of the world's largest economies are led by populists or autocrats while the political mainstream leaders are under attack.
When it comes to Europe, despite major problems and dissatisfaction among many voters, so far Italy remains the only one of Europe's largest economies that is governed by populist parties. Yet, populists enjoy success in many other European countries.
The political shifts in Europe are triggered by a combination of immigration, globalization, neoliberalism and European integration. These developments have fostered a sense of uncertainty as the contrasts within countries increased.
The jobs-for-life notion and the reassuring familiarity of one's own village, church and largely homogenous country are mostly long gone.
Simultaneously, technological developments and increased individualism have meant that political movements and parties cater more to the wishes and preferences of very specific groups. The upshot has been divided societies and political polarization.
We have even seen a tendency toward authoritarian leadership in a number of Central and Eastern European countries, leading to a decline of the EU's democratic values from the inside.
No short-lived hype
National-populism is clearly not a fleeting hype, it turns out. Matthew Goodwin and Roger Eatwell think that four factors are determining the success of the populists:
Aversion to the administrative elite and democratic institutions;
fears that the domestic culture will be undermined and destroyed;
a sense of getting less than others in the context of a crumbling welfare state, growing inequality and unfair burden-sharing; and
a widening gap between voters and the traditional parties.
Mainstream politicians are trying to remove whatever fuels populism, but they tend to go into shock if populists are successful before simply expounding that the populist politician in question is a danger to democracy.
Or, they opt for populism-light policies, which carry the risk that voters will start to disregard them as a watered-down version of the real thing. At the same time, such surrogates can undercut the democratic constitutional state. Voters may also view capitulation of the mainstream politicians as a legitimization of hardcore populism. 
Populism as recipe for happy markets?
Yet, populism does not need to have a negative impact on the financial markets in the first instance. Look at how the S&P 500 has performed under Trump and Brazil’s Bovespa Index, following Bolsonaro's election victory.
It very much remains to be seen whether investors will respond in a similar way in Europe — if populism continues to advance — as they did in Brazil and the U.S.
European countries are too small to take a hard line against great powers like America and China. Collaboration is imperative, but populists take a stand against European integration. If Europe weakens further, Beijing and Moscow will be more than happy to reap the benefits. They are already playing countries against each other.
The elections for the European Parliament (EP) at the end of May will likely provide the financial markets with additional reasons to doubt the prospects for Europe.
The center-right European People's Party (EPP) and the center-left Socialists & Democrats (S&D) will remain the biggest parties, but for the first time they will not be able to gain a majority together.
The Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) may well turn out to be the largest winner of the elections. Next, together with other Eurosceptic groups, ENF will be able to frustrate the performance of the EU.
Therefore, it seems unwise to assume that Europe will be able to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and Brazil in the sense that populist success will translate into strongly performing stock markets.
Also some of the successful European populists combine a right-wing social-cultural stance with a left-wing social-economic course. Add to that the weakening global economic climate, which will hurt Europe relatively hard since it depends heavily on trade. 
Many think that Europe is heading in the wrong direction. Most feel populist politicians will be unable to usher in the desired turnaround. The change they bring will not imbue the European economy and markets with new life.

was eagerly devoured by millions after its release. That common interest, however, masked the fact that very few minds will be changed by its content.
The report had something for everyone to reaffirm divergent views of Donald Trump
, from presumed felon to putative victim. However, what is fascinating is the sharp disconnect that emerges between his rhetoric and his conduct. Trump had spent the last two years regularly repeating a maddening mantra: witch hunt, witch hunt, witch hunt. His tweets and comments represented much of what the special counsel investigated.
Trump came close to achieving the impossible feat of obstructing the investigation into a crime that did not, in fact, occur. In the end, Mueller punted the issue by saying that whether these comments constitute a crime must turn on intent, which could not be ascertained, particularly given the refusal by Trump to be interviewed by the special counsel staff. It is notable that the special counsel repeatedly described the motivation in noncriminal terms. Trump firing Comey was clearly in response to his frustration with Comey refusing to state publicly what he was saying privately, which is that Trump was not a target. Indeed, Mueller found that Trump agreed that the Russian interference with the investigation, including any cooperating individuals, had to be fully investigated.
On some level, the indeterminacy of the conclusion on obstruction was the penalty for Trump refusing to answer questions. However, the report establishes that there really was no serious basis for a criminal charge of obstruction. Indeed, there is something peevish in not reaching an obvious conclusion. The report has precious little on obstruction that was not already known. The greatest damage that Trump did to himself was done in full view. But once his rhetoric is stripped away, his conduct was not criminal, though it was at some point contemptible.
There seems little question that Trump wanted the investigation to end and wanted to fire key players in the investigation, according to the report. But he did not fire anyone involved in the investigation. He did not destroy any evidence. He did not end the investigation prematurely. He took no actual obstructive acts. To charge him would have amounted to a virtual thought crime. The investigation did find “substantial evidence” that Trump wanted to limit the investigation by some of his actions. However, it also found that he did not do so. Trump had obstructive desires and even wanted to obstruct, but he did not actually obstruct.
What emerges from more than 400 pages and 10 investigative “episodes” is a Trump who was protected from himself by key advisers. It began with the single greatest blunder in modern presidential history, which is the firing of FBI Director James Comey
. There were ample reasons to fire Comey, who was denounced by career prosecutors and both Democratic and Republican leaders for his violation of core prosecutorial policies.
Trump could have fired Comey at the start of his administration or at the end of the Russia investigation. He just could not do it in the middle of the investigation. That is what the White House staffers uniformly told him, with one exception, which was Jared Kushner
. That was enough. Trump fired Comey and set his administration on fire. An investigation that was winding down metastasized into a spiraling inquiry with global reach.
After the Comey debacle, staffers quickly recognized that Trump was counterpunching himself into serious criminal jeopardy. That led to the most significant moment described in the report. Trump decided to take a step that would have made the moronic firing of Comey look brilliant in comparison. He ordered the firing of Mueller. At that point, staffers including White House counsel Don McGahn turned themselves into a virtual human shield to protect Trump from himself. McGahn refused to carry out the order and threatened to resign. It was an extraordinary moment. In refusing repeated orders of a sitting president, McGahn actually said that he was coming to the White House to pack his things. Instead, the president kept McGahn on and Mueller was never fired.
Had Trump gotten his wish, he well could have tripped the wire for obstruction or impeachment. He came that close. However, he did not cross the line. That is why this movie is so confusing to so many. The “Death Star” did not explode. The “Titanic” did not sink. The president did not obstruct justice. Despite his best efforts, Trump stayed just north of the criminal code. Of course, avoiding the indictable or the impeachable does not mean that some conduct was not contemptible as president.
Trump is worthy of condemnation for his conduct in seeking to end the investigation. It is clear from the report that Trump was, to some degree, saved from himself by staffers. It is an extraordinary moment for staffers to refuse a direct order from the president. Trump also instantly reminded voters how much of this was inflicted upon himself by tweeting a “Game of Thrones” image with the words “game over.” The problem is that the special counsel report makes him look a lot like Mad King Targaryen.
However, there is one aspect here that is commendable and worthy of praise. Ultimately, Trump not only ordered senior staff to cooperate with Mueller, but he did not withhold evidence. Most important, he waived executive privilege over the entirety of the report in an unprecedented degree of transparency. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with one of the most enigmatic figures in American history. Donald Trump is neither a felon nor is he blameless. Like much else in our politics, the rest is likely to be more rage than reason, as people reach their own conclusions.

and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
(D-N.Y.) both appear on Time’s annual ""100 Most Influential People"" list, released Wednesday.
Both the president and the congresswoman appear in the yearly list’s “leaders” subsection.
Trump’s profile is written by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), who hails the president for his foreign policy work in relation to North Korea and and its leader, Kim Jong Un
, who has met with Trump for two leadership summits, with a third meeting possibly in the works.
“President Trump deserves great credit for daring to try to personally persuade Chairman Kim to join the family of nations,” Christie wrote. “This approach holds the possibility for history-making changes on the Korean Peninsula to make us all safer.”
Ocasio-Cortez’s profile was written by Sen. Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.), a 2020 presidential hopeful and a fellow member of the left flank of congressional Democrats.
Warren describes the 2008 financial crisis, which occurred the same year Ocasio-Cortez lost her father to lung cancer, as a formative moment for the first-term Democratic representative.
“Her commitment to putting power in the hands of the people is forged in fire,” Warren writes. “Coming from a family in crisis and graduating from school with a mountain of debt, she fought back against a rigged system and emerged as a fearless leader in a movement committed to demonstrating what an economy, a planet and a government that works for everyone should look like.”
Ocasio-Cortez later thanked Warren for her remarks, saying she ""couldn’t be more honored and humbled.""
“Even while greed and corruption slow our progress ... true power still rests with the people.“ - @ewarren

Couldn’t be more honored and humbled to read these words from a woman I admire so deeply.

Thank you, Senator Warren, for your tireless fight for working families. https://t.co/JX0frVYPTJ
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 17, 2019
This week, Ocasio-Cortez praised the detailed policies Warren has proposed as part of her presidential bid, calling it ""truly remarkable and transformational.""
While Ocasio-Cortez and her signature Green New Deal environmental legislation are frequent targets of conservatives, Trump has rarely mentioned her directly. He hailed her primary victory last summer against 10-term Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), a top ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.), but has more recently referred to the 29-year-old “a young bartender.”
Pelosi joined Trump and Ocasio-Cortez on the list, with former Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton
describing the Speaker as “living proof that when it comes to getting the job done, more often than not, it takes a woman.”
Special counsel Robert Mueller
received a profile by former acting Attorney General Sally Yates
, who praised Mueller’s discretion over the course of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh, the subject of a heated confirmation fight last fall that reignited the debate over handling of sexual assault allegations, also made the list, with his profile penned by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.).
“The country saw his resilience and commitment to public service. We saw his loyal devotion to family and friends. We saw his undeterred reverence for the law, for precedents and for our nation’s highest traditions,” McConnell writes.
McConnell himself also received a spot on the list, with former House Speaker John Boehner
(R-Ohio) writing that “with his mastery of parliamentary procedure and commitment to principled democratic governance, [McConnell] has shaped the direction of the Supreme Court for generations to come.”

Proponents encourage local law enforcement officers to unilaterally ignore gun safety, background check, and firearm regulations that are contrary to their political views. Anyone who believes that equal protection under the law is the cornerstone of our democracy should be concerned to see sheriffs in a handful of states vowing they will not comply with or enforce state laws they do not personally support.
As the sheriff of Multnomah County in Oregon, my duty is not to write laws or decide if they stand under the Constitution. My job is to respect the process and enforce our laws to ensure public safety. The courts have upheld, time and again, reasonable restrictions on firearms. Even Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the Supreme Court, emphasized that like most rights, “the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.”
It is up to our legislators to balance our Second Amendment rights with the public safety needs of all our communities across the nation as they draft our laws. It is up to the courts to weigh in if they overstep. I have deep respect for sheriffs in other jurisdictions working to meet the public safety needs of their constituents. However, refusing to comply with or enforce gun safety laws sets a dangerous precedent.
It weakens public trust in law enforcement when we cherry pick which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore or even defy. When someone disagrees with a particular law or policy, there are a number of ways to challenge it by going to court or lobbying legislators to change the law. If that fails, they can elect new lawmakers. The Constitution guarantees these rights to all citizens so we can live in a country governed by laws.
As someone who handles a gun in my job each day, I respect the Second Amendment. I also know that Oregon has strong gun laws make our state safer for all our citizens, including the men and women who serve in law enforcement. I have seen far too many families, including those of fellow law enforcement officers, changed forever by unnecessary gun violence.
My state has a rich history of responsible gun ownership. I firmly believe that there is no inherent conflict between the Second Amendment and common sense gun safety laws that bring together responsible gun owners, law enforcement officers, and political advocates on both sides of the issue to forge solutions that make sense for our nation. What is truly dangerous is guns in the hands of people who should never have them. In my line of work, I am glad that Oregon has enacted strong gun safety laws that protect both innocent citizens and law enforcement officers alike.
No single law will prevent every shooting, just like no traffic law will prevent every road death, but sensible gun laws save lives. I enforce gun safety laws to protect my family, my colleagues, and my community. I urge other members of law enforcement to respect our system of government and do their job without political prejudice. Our safety, our professional integrity, and the democratic rule of law depend on it.

testified in front of the Senate Appropriations Committee. In an exchange with Senator Jeanne Shaheen
, Barr answered, “I think spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur.”
He received immediate pushback for his comments. “Let me just say how very, very dismaying and disappointing that the chief law enforcement officer is going off the rails,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
said in response to his comments. She went on to say, “He is the attorney general of the United States of America, not the attorney general of Donald Trump
.”
Former FBI Director James Comey
, who oversaw the bureau during the 2016 campaign, declared, “When I hear that kind of language used, it is concerning because the FBI and the Department of Justice conduct court ordered electronic surveillance. I have never thought of that as spying.”
The general consensus among Democrats now is that Barr has overstepped his role as attorney general and is attempting to protect the president. However, I think given the events that occurred during and after the 2016 campaign, it is only right that the Justice Department investigate the actions taken by our intelligence community and the FBI. I would not go as far as Barr and say that spying occurred. Rather, I would say that based on the information we know, unauthorized surveillance occurred. This has become clear through facts that are now available.
FBI actions throughout the 2016 campaign raised questions from analysts on both sides of the political aisle. Its reluctance to divulge concerns with the Trump campaign, its unwillingness to share information gathered with Congress, and its outright failure to disclose to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the dossier it was using to request a warrant was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were certainly out of protocol for standard FBI operating procedures.
The Justice Department should look into the FBI, Comey in his role as director, and the rest of the intelligence community to ensure that unauthorized surveillance never happens again. To be clear, I am not accusing Comey of malpractice, but considering FBI actions taken over the past three years, there are residual questions that need answering.
The attorney general has a right to find out whether the investigation into the 2016 campaign was appropriate, what factors led to it, and whether or not intelligence officials were correct in launching their investigation. This investigation into the intelligence community and the FBI is not payback, as some Democrats have suggested. This is good government at work.
Ultimately, we need to ensure there is a nonpartisan and unideological examination of the intelligence community and the FBI. Both Congress and the American public need to know the details of what happened so that history does not repeat itself. Similarly, I believe the public must see the full report of the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller
. This view is not extreme, and is shared by lawmakers across the spectrum, so why is requesting that Barr investigate the FBI considered off the rails?
This investigation should continue without partisan bloviating. Lawmakers across the political spectrum should want transparency in government, and they should eschew partisanship to ensure this happens. Considering the allegations and events that have occurred over the past three years, it is time that we work to restore trust and confidence in our government.
This will be done by Barr releasing the full special counsel report and conducting a thorough and nonpartisan review of the unauthorized surveillance during the 2016 campaign. Only then can the American public rest assured with renewed faith in how its government works.

0,04/13/19 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/438745-trolling-of-bill-barr-shows-how-language-is-twisted-to-politics,Trolling of Bill Barr shows how language is twisted to politics,"In the novel “1984,” author George Orwell wrote that “if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” Democrats appear to be taking that idea to heart this week with their bizarre outcry over Attorney General William Barr
referring to the government “spying” that targeted Trump presidential campaign figures. Suddenly, the term “spying” was declared as categorically exclusive of any intelligence surveillance.
As someone who has done classified national security work since the Reagan administration, I was surprised by the new Democratic dialectic, but it is not the first time that I missed the memo on the updated meaning of common terms, from “wiretapping” to “collusion.” The problem for Barr is that contemporary politics has outstripped common meaning. That was evident in his two hearings in Congress this week. His answers appeared immaterial to the discussion, and lawmakers raised the objection that Barr could not possibly have read the special counsel's report and conclusions in the 48 hours that it had taken to issue his summary of the findings.
Of course, after the report was submitted, many pundits suggested that Barr might just “sit” on it or give no information at all while refusing to release any part of it. Instead, he took only 48 hours and the narrative changed. At the House hearing, Representative Nita Lowey
sarcastically called it all “quite extraordinary” that he “received a very serious detailed report, hundreds of pages of high-level information, weighed the factors and conclusions at length, outlined, prepared, edited, and released” the memo in less than 48 hours. “To me, to do this, it seems your mind must have been already made up. How did you do it?” Lowey asked him.
The response from Barr was as clear as it was crushing. He explained that he did not just get the conclusions of Robert Mueller
but that the basic findings had been disclosed weeks earlier. He said that his conclusion on the lack of criminal obstruction by President Trump
was reached together with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
, who Democrats have maintained for almost two years is essential and unassailable in reaching such findings. Finally, Barr disclosed that the special counsel staff is assisting in making redactions, the report came with summaries and Mueller had been consulted on his prior letters.
None of that mattered. It did not matter that Rosenstein described the questioning of the intentions of Barr or the necessity for redactions as “completely bizarre” and that, in his view, Barr has been “as forthcoming as he can.” The narrative has continued unabated, and billionaire Tom Steyer has even funded a national commercial repeating how ridiculous it is that Barr could have determined the conclusions of the special counsel report in just two days. His words simply did not matter until they did.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen
asked why the attorney general was evidently looking into the basis for the secret investigation into the 2016 campaign. Barr explained that he was concerned about any kind of spying, foreign or domestic, on our political process. Shaheen was shocked and said, “You are not suggesting, though, that spying occurred.” Barr was again very direct and measured when he answered, “I think spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated.” He then continued, “I am not suggesting it was not adequately predicated, but I need to explore that. I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I am saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it. That is all.”
Washington went into its now signature feigned vapors. Speaker Nancy Pelosi
denounced the use of “spying” and said, “I do not trust Barr.” Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer
called it “peddling conspiracy theories,” while House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff
said the word meant that Barr was “spewing partisan talking points” and striking yet “another destructive blow to our democratic institutions.”
The most mortified observer was fired FBI Director James Comey
, who took a moment on his book tour and declared, “When I hear that kind of language used, it is concerning because the FBI and the Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance. If the attorney general has come to the belief that that should be called spying, wow.”
That was also my reaction. Just wow. For years, “spying” and “surveillance” have been synonymous. Indeed, Democrats and the media have used the terms interchangeably, until another language change was spontaneously declared this week. It was all too familiar. Early during his administration, Trump accused the government of “wiretapping” campaign officials. The media went into a frenzy, calling that a “fake scandal” and a “diversion.”
It was later shown that campaign figures were targeted by the FBI and that secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act orders were based on an application that relied on the Steele dossier funded by the Clinton campaign. Obama national security adviser Susan Rice categorically denied that she ordered the “unmasking” of the names of Trump associates under surveillance but later admitted that was a lie. None of that mattered again. Instead, the media chose to focus on the use of “wiretapping” to insist that no literal wiretapping occurred.
From the outset, it was an absurd point. “Wiretapping” was previously often used as a generality for surveillance. “Surveillance” was a term that came into vogue later. Indeed, the Supreme Court has commonly used “wiretapping” or “eavesdropping” for “surveillance” in its opinions. There is no physical splicing of wires needed in modern surveillance. However, the entire point was that the discussion was focused on the lexicon.
The same thing occurred at the start of the special counsel investigation. Some of us supported the appointment of Mueller but warned that there was no crime of “collusion” and that related crimes such as conspiracy were highly unlikely to be established. The media discussed whether Trump was guilty of collusion, despite there being no such crime in the federal code. It did not matter until an actual alleged crime of obstruction became available, and then suddenly collusion was the context for any possible crime.
Trump is equally untethered by language. He calls his critics “traitors” and nimbly changes the meaning of even the clearest statements such as “Mexico will pay for the wall.” Neither language nor facts prove a burden for the president. If all of this is confusing, it is because you have not spent any time recently on college campuses. Speech codes are now common, and the meaning of terms is based on how language is received rather than intended. Language is now indeterminate and can easily be declared “microaggressive” solely on how it is received rather than intended.
In the same way, it does not matter that what Barr meant was reasonable or that he immediately clarified “wiretapping” as “improper surveillance.” It was important to portray as an absurdity any suggestion of the Obama administration spying on a Republican campaign, even though two key officials were targeted during the campaign. So language now reflects our politics as unhinged and undefined. We have been reduced to a language of trolls. As explained in “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,” it is not hard. “Anyone can speak troll. All you have to do is point and grunt.”

0,04/11/19 01:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/438306-if-trump-and-moon-work-effectively-together-progress-towards-peace-can,"If Trump and Moon work effectively together, progress towards peace can resume","South Korean President Moon Jae-in will be in Washington to meet with President Trump
in an attempt to restart negotiations with North Korea after the abrupt end to February’s Hanoi Summit. If Trump and Moon work effectively together, progress towards peace can resume.
Moon said he will hold “in-depth discussions” with Trump to “further progress in the Korean Peninsula peace process,” which is ultimately geared toward the “complete denuclearization of the peninsula.”
South Korea’s new unification minister offered additional insight. Noting that all parties have made considerable progress from the “fire and fury” days of 2017, Kim Yeon-chul said it is important to “seize the opportunity for co-prosperity of the South and the North. We never know when such a chance will come again if we miss it.”
These statements provide important clues as to what Moon wants Trump to support, and in what order: the pursuit of peace first, further integration and normalization between the North and South, and then — at some point in the distant future, after enough trust has been mutually established — work toward denuclearization.
This step-by-step framework is one Kim Jong-un has repeatedly stated he is willing to pursue, even if his sincerity towards genuine denuclearization is very much in question. The ultimate objective is the security of the United States and the benefit of our allies in the region, and this approach would give all parties the best chance at success.
What guarantees failure, however, is to continue following the stale Washington playbook that has proved so ineffective over the past 25 years: demanding full nuclear disarmament up front.
Heading into the Hanoi Summit, all signs indicated Trump recognized the futility of this old approach. He seemed to realize diplomacy would take time and patience.
Prior to the summit, Trump frequently told the media that he was taking the long view of negotiations, saying, “I’m in no rush. There’s no testing. As long as there is no testing, I’m in no rush.” In a speech at Stanford just days before Hanoi, senior negotiator Steven Biegun noted the U.S. would not demand unilateral compliance to a long list of demands, but rather was “prepared to pursue — simultaneously and in parallel — all of the commitments our two leaders made in their joint statement at Singapore.”
Disappointingly, national security adviser John Bolton, whose hawkish views towards Pyongyang are well known, took the lead for negotiations, relegating Biegun to back-row status. And as a result, the talks failed to reach any agreement at all.
Reuters reported the prime reason for this unproductive conclusion was a list of requirements Bolton convinced Trump to present to Kim, including a demand that North Korea unilaterally surrender all its nuclear weapons directly to the United States. The list “appeared to represent Bolton’s long-held and hardline ‘Libya model’ of denuclearization that North Korea has rejected repeatedly.” Of course, it failed.
With this week’s meeting in Washington, Trump has a chance to reverse that misstep.
Following his instincts, Trump has worked effectively with Moon since early 2018, ushering in an unprecedented opportunity to bring peace to Korea. What Trump should do now is reject advice from Bolton and instead pursue the diplomatic opening he’s helped to create. Thursday’s meeting with Moon is an opportunity to regain the initiative Bolton lost in Hanoi.
At a security conference in Seoul this week, the speaker of South Korea’s National Assembly said reflexive distrust of North Korea — which often characterizes establishment Washington thinking — is a barrier to progress. “Rather than saying that the North would never forgo its nuclear program,” Moon Hee-sang said, “We need to forge a diplomatic environment in which the North cannot help but give up its nukes.” There is a path available which makes such an outcome at least plausible, and Trump can take steps along that path this week.
A good first step would be the exchange of diplomatic liaison offices between Pyongyang and Washington, establishing lines of normal communication that can be used to coordinate further progress.
Second, in exchange for Kim taking firm, concrete steps of dismantling the Yongbyon nuclear facility — confirmed in the presence of unfettered international inspectors — Trump and Moon could offer limited, targeted sanctions relief to economic projects related to inter-Korean development.
Such relief could include snap-back provisions should North Korea fail to live up to the terms of agreement. Yet it would also build trust between the parties and make further mutual steps towards peace possible.
Bolton’s advice is a losing proposition, and following it saddles Trump with unnecessary risk and high probability of increased tensions. The president takes almost no risk, however, by joining Moon in seeking constructive diplomacy, because no matter what may happen in the future, the security of the United States will always be guaranteed by our overwhelming nuclear and conventional military deterrent.

0,04/09/19 06:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/438092-is-there-new-hope-in-algeria,Is there new hope in Algeria?,"The surprise resignation of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after weeks of popular protests has raised hopes that genuine democratic change could be coming to the country. While his fall is certainly an important development, all signs indicate that the power brokers in Algeria have learned the lessons of the Arab Spring and are embarking on a crisis management campaign designed to shore up the status quo.
Like a number of its autocratic neighbors, Algeria is managing this crisis in light of the lessons of the Arab Spring, but without instituting genuine reforms. As the first Arab Spring country to undergo a democratic transition, Tunisia has proven to be an exception to the rule. In Egypt, despite the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, over time the military was ultimately able to organize a counterrevolution and stifle true democratic change. Absorbing these lessons, the Algerian government has moved swiftly to orchestrate the resignation of Bouteflika and a process for succession in an attempt to deny the protesters a Tunisian outcome.
How did we get here? Fifteen years after the end of the civil war in Algeria, the tenuous promises of its social contract are unraveling. The near complete centralization of power within the two ruling parties and security establishment has stifled dialogue and debate. Decision making has remained in the hands of the economic, political, and military elite, known as “le pouvoir,” as well as the “tripartite” comprised of the trade union federation, an entrepreneurial lobby, and the cabinet. The citizenry is frustrated and angry about the deteriorating economy and lack of opportunity, but they have had few outlets through which to express their discontent and secure meaningful action from the government.
Algeria has attempted to manage these internal contradictions through measures designed to appease key constituencies. Since the early 2000s, Algeria has relied on public spending to maintain social stability through cash subsidies, free housing, and other forms of handouts. In 2011 and 2014, the government attempted to spend its way out of crisis without making much needed structural changes to the economy. While effective in the short term, this model of citizen appeasement further entrenched Algerian interests and rigidity, while neglecting to institute the democratic reforms for the government to be truly responsive to citizen needs.
Much of the current unrest in Algeria can be attributed to the direct consequences of the collapse in oil prices and the structural inability and unwillingness of the government provide a palatable response to the challenge. With hydrocarbon revenues, which account for 60 percent of government revenues and 95 percent of export earnings, down by half, the government instituted some punishing austerity measures including a 14 percent spending cut, price increases on subsidized items, and a freeze on public sector hiring. Despite these efforts, the government has drained its coffers and the unemployment rate remains at more than 11 percent, with youth unemployment at around a staggering 29 percent.
Long term stability in Algeria can only be achieved through meaningful structural reforms that close the gap between the citizenry and the government. The resignation of Bouteflika is a positive step, but for real change to take place, the government must address the need for greater transparency and broader inclusiveness. It should begin by engaging the population, and importantly young people, in an effort to renegotiate the social contract. Furthermore, the protestors and political opposition must be allowed to organize and participate in any upcoming elections.
Most critically, economic reforms are necessary to tackle the rentier economy in Algeria, which has left the country vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices and has hindered sustainable economic growth. Reducing red tape, improving access to finance, and reducing national dependence on oil and gas by diversifying the economy are crucial to securing accountability from state institutions and private sector actors.
The situation in Algeria remains a test of wills. Can the authorities sustain an approach in which they merely manage popular frustrations in order to protect the status quo, or will the forces of democratic change prevail and deliver a Tunisian outcome? The resignation of Bouteflika, while indeed welcome, is by no means a guarantee that either course will prevail.

was right to warn the Democratic Party that, unless it reshapes its course, it may create a circular firing squad. Historically, just look to the Democratic Party of 1972, when George McGovern lost 49 states to Richard Nixon, another controversial, polarizing president. It was both the high point of the progressive movement in the party and the low point of the party’s presidential power.
Except for a brief recovery post-Watergate with Jimmy Carter, Democrats did not come back from their 1972 record loss until 1992, and that was with a 41 percent vote for President Bill Clinton
, aided by the entry of independent Ross Perot into that year’s presidential race. Even with that help, it took a return to the center to reignite the fortunes of the Democratic Party and we got 49 per cent in 1996.
Last November, Democrats made significant gains in the House of Representatives, adding a total of 40 districts and taking the majority. Most of those were suburban districts that voted for Republicans Mitt Romney
or Donald Trump
in the past. They are not districts that could ever be won by an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
(D-N.Y.), a Bernie Sanders
(I-Vt.), or any of the leaders of the new progressive wing of the Democratic Party. These districts’ voters were concerned about health care, saw the Trump administration as out of step with their more centrist concerns, and gave low marks to a Republican House led by then-Speaker Paul Ryan
(R-Wis.) that seemed fractured and ineffective.
Since the midterms, Trump continues to enjoy strong ratings on the economy and for combatting terrorism, two issues of heightened importance in family-oriented suburbs. In addition, he has been cleared by special counsel Robert Mueller
of the charge of colluding with the Russians. Women still have grave doubts about him, but he has proven a tough competitor, defying the odds.
But what have swing voters been hearing from Democrats, since switching their votes in the midterms over to the Dems? Socialism, anti-Semitism, resistance, more investigations. Not exactly a platform for re-election.
And the congressional Socialists led by Rep. Ocasio-Cortez are even threatening mainstream Democrats with primaries. Yup, replacing moderates in swing districts with left-wing democratic socialists is surely the way to expand the majority. Suburbanites are clamoring for them. Higher taxes is just what hard-pressed suburban voters with lots of responsibilities are seeking.
The public face of the party today is far removed from what created a solid group of freshmen in suburban districts. And they have been bombarded with a lot more than just slogans. Ocasio-Cortez, who pulled down about 15,000 votes in a Democratic primary in a safe district, is world-renowned now for the Green New Deal — just a little program to nationalize the energy industry while promising guaranteed incomes for all; its price tag has been put at $93 trillion. It’s Ocasio-Cortez who drove Amazon out of New York, not understanding that the tax breaks for the company would have come from 10 times the tax revenue that the new jobs would have created, or that their absence blows a $27 billion hole in future budgets. Comically, she thought you could spend the $3 billion on other things.
The other new face of the party has been Rep. Ilhan Omar
(D-Minn.), who spread her anti-Israel positions by expressing anti-Semitic tropes about how Jews in America have divided loyalties and how Jews have bought support for Israel with “Benjamins.” Despite most voters believing Omar should be off the House Foreign Affairs Committee with these views, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) has kept her on this prestigious assignment while passing over moderates.
Let’s not forget the daily voices of Reps. Jerrold Nadler
(D-N.Y.) and Adam Schiff
(D-Calif.). They get media coverage (to a shrinking audience) on how there really is evidence of collusion and make escalating demands for the tax returns of Donald Trump and his associates. Nixon had an enemies list of people he was going to audit — and these folks are attempting to revive the practice. It didn’t work out that well for Nixon.
The Democratic House and Senate leaders apparently decided that resistance to the Trump administration — rather than true deal-making — makes the most sense, holding out for a presidential victory in 2020. That strategic decision, unless soon reversed, might be their undoing. Had they opted for deals, they would have made a DACA-for-border-security swap, moved on infrastructure, and partnered on tax cuts to provide much more deductibility of state and local taxes. They think no deal is a better deal. Americans may — or may not — think so.
While Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Rep. Maxine Waters
(D-Calif.) have been given outsized power, the newly elected moderates — the ones whose victories empowered the other Democrats in the House — have been largely shunted to the side. They have been castigated from all sides, protested against in their town hall meetings, denied plum committee assignments, and had to accept a watered-down resolution condemning anti-Semitism.
On top of all of these discordant voices in Congress are the 15 or so Democratic presidential candidates, many of them vying for the ultra-left sliver of Democratic activists and media who are far removed from the life of the everyday Democratic voter. Many are backing the Green New Deal, immigration policies that approach open borders, and are united in their desire to raise taxes for new spending.
Joe Biden
, a potentially moderating influence on all this, has been temporarily set back with charges that his glad-handing was too intimate, and he has been tied up in knots explaining his behavior even before getting to the starting gate. Another potential moderate on economic issues, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, has decided he would not have a chance in this New Democratic Party. That leaves Starbucks founder Howard Schultz in the center and, since he is running outside of the party, he is more likely to be a spoiler than to convince more Democratic candidates to move to the center with him.
If there’s not a change of course here in the next year, Barack Obama is right that 2020 is shaping up to be more like a circular firing squad than a march to victory. If someone in the leadership of the House or among the presidential candidates does not stand up and reset the emerging positioning, the party will be painted as running on a platform of socialism, $93 trillion for global warming, anti-Israel policies, open borders, a government takeover of the health care system, and raising taxes to boot.
The course to Democratic victory in 2020 is responsible free enterprise, not socialism; the center, not the left; and policies based on reality, not tens of trillions of dollars. This was true in the past — and I believe it holds true for the future.

is replete with underappreciated bipartisan achievements that have broad appeal to the electorate, posing a real threat to the Democrats in 2020. Still, even while most liberals are working overtime to distort his broad spectrum platform, some Democrats are acknowledging that Trump pursuing goals they genuinely support, such as withdrawing American troops from overseas conflicts.
In a recent interview, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna
of California praised the foreign policy of Trump, calling for a coalition of bipartisan lawmakers to help him accomplish his objectives. “Instead of all the trillions of dollars that we have spent on these wars, imagine if we built our infrastructure, if we invested in our people, if we helped build our country to make sure that we win in the 21st century,” he said, echoing concerns Trump has with China. “That is a message that every American, regardless of whether you voted for President Trump or whether you voted for a Democratic member of Congress, can get behind.”
The noninterventionist stance Trump has taken on foreign policy is hardly the only part of his platform that has broad appeal among voters. As hinted at by Khanna, Trump views foreign affairs as directly to his belief in adopting “America First” policies and strengthening the United States economy. To accomplish this, Trump has implemented targeted tariffs against China and renegotiated outdated trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement that failed to serve our interests.
Taking such bold steps on trade was a significant departure from the political orthodoxy of both parties in recent years. While the Republican establishment had sought to placate China rather than stand up to its rampant trade abuses, the Democratic establishment had abandoned American workers in pursuit of job killing environmentalist policies.
Instead of toeing the establishment line, Trump had the courage to point out that “free trade” was not really free. The president took the necessary steps to strengthen once forgotten middle class, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs since he took office. Trump has also received bipartisan accolades for his work on prison reform as well as the opioid epidemic, which have resulted in meaningful policy changes that will make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans.
“With the election of Donald Trump, advocates worried they had missed their chance at criminal justice reform,” NBC News wrote last year as the president was poised to sign the landmark legislation First Step Act into law. “They were wrong.” The network added, “The rare bipartisan consensus came directly as a result of White House involvement.”
Despite the endless barrage of attacks from his critics on the left, Trump has actually been a broad spectrum leader with a policy agenda that serves the interests of every American voter. That vision is exactly what propelled Trump to an historic election victory in 2016, and it should be the greatest concern for Democrats in the campaign for 2020.

, woozy and perhaps regretful at having over imbibed. This is the second such sobering experience for Democrats, the first being the election of Donald Trump
after admitting he sexually assaulted women, leaving many Democrats to wonder: Is Trump Teflon? The answer is no.
Sure, he wears a suit of shining armor that glistens to his base. For that segment of the electorate, he is the Game of Thrones character “The Mountain,” who is larger than life, foreboding, dangerous, and well sheathed. He is often left for dead, then comes roaring back to life.
But Charlie Cook, whose team includes the best analysts in the political forecasting business, wrote a column showing where the kinks in the armor may be. He found 35 percent of the electorate is locked in for Trump no matter what bad he does, 45 percent is locked in against him no matter what good he does, and the remaining 20 percent is up for grabs. That means that 2020 will be the “Battle for the Quintile.”
These are the voters who supported Trump in 2016 and House Democrats to check him in 2018. They are not swing voters but rollercoaster voters who chose Barack Obama

apparently could not resist taking one last parting shot at President Trump
, even as he acknowledged that there is no evidence to support the Russia collusion theory. According to Attorney General William Barr
, Mueller “did not draw a conclusion” as to “whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.” In consultation with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
, Barr determined that the evidence is “not sufficient to establish” that Trump committed obstruction.
In other words, after an investigation lasting nearly two years and costing taxpayers more than $25 million, Mueller merely shrugged his shoulders and passed the buck to Barr when it came to the critical question of obstructed justice. That is basically the same thing former FBI Director James Comey
did when he declared that Hillary Clinton
was “extremely careless” with her use of a private email server for classified messages while declining to charge her with a crime. By not reaching a conclusion on obstruction, Mueller made sure Democrats would have an opportunity to render their own verdict once Barr makes the full report available.
“Shame on Mueller for not having the guts to come to a decision one way or another,” Alan Dershowitz declared in a recent interview. “The job of a prosecutor is to make decisions. To charge or not to charge. It is not to write law review essays that lay out on the one hand, on the other hand,” the professor elaborated in an opinion column. “The last thing prosecutors should do is encourage partisan political use of their statements not dealing with charges they do not file.”
The decision that Mueller made to punt on the obstruction question is especially irksome in light of his simultaneous conclusion that there is evidence pointing to collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Since there was no collusion, how could Trump have obstructed justice in an investigation of a crime that was never committed?
“It is a cheap shot,” Rudy Giuliani, himself a former United States attorney, said in a recent interview. “There is something extremely ‘Bush League’ about investigating something” where “there is no crime committed.” Bush League is right. Planting the seeds of an obstruction charge in an investigation of a crime someone did not commit seems like the last resort of a frustrated prosecutor on a personal vendetta.
“So if President Trump, and nobody in his campaign colluded with Russia, how can they be covering up for something they did not do? Where is the burden?” Senator Rand Paul
asked in a recent interview. Naturally, Comey publicly defended Mueller, arguing in a recent interview that the Justice Department should not always have to “prove the underlying crime.” Fortunately, the days as a federal law enforcement officer are over for Comey, and the man now in charge of upholding the rule of law in this country does not share his cavalier attitude toward justice.
Senator Lindsey Graham
, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he is all but certain that Barr will soon open a Justice Department investigation into alleged abuses of power by Comey, Barack Obama
, Andrew McCabe
, and others. “It is not a question of if he looks, it is how he looks,” Graham said in a recent interview, indicating that Barr is merely deliberating over whether to appoint a second special counsel.
Meanwhile, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz publicly confirmed that his office is still investigating possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by Justice Department officials during their investigation into Trump and members of his presidential campaign, a probe started nearly a year ago and could reveal a great deal about the deep state conspiracy to overturn the 2016 election results.
Mueller deciding to pass on obstruction certainly seems like a “cheap shot” aimed at Trump, but at long last there are now Justice Department leaders like Barr who are committed to equal justice and the rule of law. They will expose such abuses of power to public scrutiny and restore much needed impartiality to law enforcement in this country.

0,03/07/19 06:30 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/433137-criticism-of-israeli-policy-is-not-anti-semitism,Criticism of Israeli policy is not anti-Semitism,"Today the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning anti-Semitism. There shouldn’t be anything controversial about speaking out against hatred. But this was clearly designed to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar
(D-Minn.).
Rep. Omar has faced intense criticism in recent weeks as a result of several comments that she has made critical of Israeli policy and U.S. political support for Israel. The attacks on Rep. Omar are unwarranted and are being used to silence legitimate criticism of Israeli policy. This is part of a larger effort to legislatively challenge traditional definitions of anti-Semitism by terming all criticism of Israel and political Zionism as forms of anti-Semitism. 
At a time when real anti-Semitism is on the rise, this is particularly dangerous. Rather than focusing on silencing debate, we need to be looking at the political environment that is enabling the violent anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and white supremacy on display in places like Charlottesville, Pittsburgh, Portland, and across the country.
Rep. Omar is now being accused of making anti-Semitic statements and this is reflected in the bill which repeatedly goes out of its way to identify accusations of dual loyalty made against Jews as a particularly pernicious form of anti-Semitism. While the final bill brought for a vote was also broadened to include explicit condemnations of Islamophobia, racism, and other forms of discrimination, a number of key Democratic officials made it clear that their motivation for pushing the bill at this time remained their anger over (misrepresented) statement made by Rep. Omar.
It is clearly anti-Semitic to single out Jews and to accuse them of dual loyalty if they support Israel. If Rep. Omar had done that she should be held to account. But that isn’t what she said.
In a speech focused on the need to address discrimination and racism, Omar included the following line:
“But it’s almost as if every single time we say something, regardless of what it is we say… we get to be labeled in something… and nobody ever gets to have the broader debate of ‘what is happening with Palestine?’ So for me, I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country. I want to ask, why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the NRA, of fossil-fuel industries, or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobby that is influencing policy…”
This isn’t a statement targeted towards Jews or any particular group of people. It is a statement about the limits of debate present in this country when it comes to Israel. Those who worked so hard to censure Rep. Omar brought into focus the truth of her claim.

GREGORY J. WALLANCE: Ilhan Omar's dual loyalty charge was about more than anti-Semitism
---
Indeed, Rep. Juan Vargas
tweeted, “questioning support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is unacceptable.” 
Isn’t stating that it is unacceptable to question the U.S.-Israel relationship (and presumably Israeli policy) effectively the same as calling for unquestioning support of a foreign country? And isn’t conflating non-specific criticism of pro-Israel actions and positions with criticism of Jewish people or Judaism itself dangerous and problematic
This isn’t the first time that Rep. Omar has been accused of anti-Semitism for her statements. In February controversy arose over a tweet she wrote on the role of AIPAC money in influencing congressional decisions. But again her words did not — in substance — say anything different than what the Wall Street Journal tweeted several days later:“Aipac, the pro-Israel lobby, raises more than $100 million a year, which it spends on lobbying politicians for U.S. aid and sending members of Congress to Israel.”
Anti-Semitism must be condemned. At the same time, it is dangerous to focus so much attention on trying to portray all criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic while politicians like Donald Trump, Rep. Jim Jordan, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, and others have put forward seemingly anti-Semitic positions without censure. In a growing climate of white supremacist racism and xenophobia, it is also dangerous to let legitimate policy criticisms be painted as anti-Semitism in order to vilify one of the first Muslim women in Congress.
Since entering office in January, Rep. Omar has been called a terrorist, threatened with assassination, and subjected to a level of scrutiny experienced by few other members of Congress. Rather than condemning Rep. Omar, Congress needs to stand with her as she faces discrimination and racism as a Black woman, as an immigrant, and as Muslim.
Successful pressure from activists resulted in significant and positive changes in the final bill. The addition of condemnations of Islamophobia, White Supremacy, and other forms of racism and discrimination, including specific actions and threats against members of congress, is positive and greatly strengthens the final bill. Overall the aims of the bill are aims that should be supported.    

However, it is important to not let the changes made to the final bill obscure the reality that this was an ill-conceived and politicized process, and it is a shame that this may now stand in the way of more considerate efforts to address the interlinked threats of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, White Supremacy and all forms of bigotry.

Their proposals include providing universal health care, lowering the cost of higher education, fixing our national infrastructure, reforming our broken immigration laws, changing current tax policies, and more. Ideas are great, especially aspirational ones that demonstrate the nuts and bolts of a policy agenda that also looks toward the next generations.
Great presidents, in almost all cases, have had a vision for the future of the United States. They put forth ideas that motivate and inspire the American people. However, ideas are not enough. As we have learned, absolutely nothing can be accomplished by working through the system without management expertise, knowledge of how the different federal government branches interact, and the ability to put together a high performance team of professionals that can actually get things done.
I know from my own experience. When I moved from being a member of Congress to being secretary of the Agriculture Department in the 1990s, there was a steep learning curve. I went from managing a small legislative office with a couple dozen staffers to managing an agency with nearly 100,000 employees. I realized right away that I clearly could not be effective in getting anything done without understanding the nuance and complexity of the programs we were administering, and developing a high performance team was my ticket to gaining that deeper knowledge.
That same team could advise me about these policy challenges. When I came to a decision about what to do, they could implement my agenda. I knew I could work with Congress closely in the process, supported by my team. Anything I wanted to get done took skills and patience. That was at the Agriculture Department. The true complexity of managing the overall operations of the entire government is exponentially much more difficult.
It is incredible that in the campaign process, where some fundamental and complex questions of national policy are debated, candidates for president are rarely asked about their qualifications for managing a large complicated bureaucracy. If you cannot organize a government that works to get things done, then you cannot be an effective president.
Reporters love to ask about proposals and conflicts, but they rarely probe into whether the candidate has the necessary skills and background to actually move an agenda. Leadership requires both ideas for the future as well as management skills and knowledge of the system to get those ideas adopted by Congress. It would be most helpful to voters if the national media pressed our candidates on this question as a matter of routine.
I am not saying that being a lawmaker is a disqualifier for the duties of president, but all candidates should speak to their management and administrative experience. I, along with millions of other citizens, want someone to actually get things done for the American people. A great president would restore their confidence in our government by standing ready to push policy. It is not enough to dream great ideas, although that is a necessary part of leadership, but those ideas must be actionable. A president and his or her team must have the skills to make that happen.

In the latest manifestation of that enduring toxin, certain of our recently elected congressional representatives view U.S. support for Israel as inexplicable without reference to the disproportionate influence of Jewish money (e.g., “It’s all about the Benjamins, baby”) and a special allegiance to Israel. They are dismissive of explanations of shared values or strategic importance. With a touch of exasperation, they ask what reason other than a malignant influence could possibly explain why the United States, without parallel among nations, has supported Israel and Zionism.
Their ill-founded thinking is based on a failure to appreciate the extent to which the restoration of the Jewish people to sovereignty in their ancient homeland has been deeply ingrained in the religious, political and social fabric of America. Before there was an AIPAC, before Theodor Herzl founded the modern Zionist movement, and even before there was a United States, our Founding Fathers and even their forefathers longed to restore the Jews to their ancient homeland.
In short, Zionism is as American as apple pie.
The Puritans saw themselves as a “New Israel” in fleeing persecution and embraced the Old Testament. Increase Mather, the Puritan leader, taught his followers that one day the “Jews would return to their homeland and establish the most glorious nation in the world.” During the colonial and post-colonial period, Hebrew often would be taught in Ivy League universities, and the Yale coat of arms would be adorned with the Hebrew words meaning “light and perfection.”
With the break from England, Americans saw the parallel to the Exodus, and Benjamin Franklin — of “all about the Benjamins” fame — recommended that the Great Seal of the United States be an illustration of the Hebrews fleeing Egypt for their homeland.
The religious and political support for a Jewish homeland would continue in the 19th century. John Adams, who wrote Thomas Jefferson that the Hebrews have “done more to civilize man than any other nation,” would write in 1819: “I really wish the Jews again in Judea an independent nation.” Americans would also evolve from advocating the return of Jews to their ancestral land to interceding on their behalf. The first Protestant missionaries left Boston in 1819 with the goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. This all occurred when the Jews in America numbered only in the thousands.
By the end of the 19th century, evangelist William Blackstone submitted a petition to President Benjamin Harrison for the establishment of a Jewish state; the petition was signed by the most prominent Americans, including the chief justice of the Supreme Court, future president William McKinley and John D. Rockefeller.
Admittedly, Christian religious support for a Jewish homeland was primarily rooted in the belief that a Jewish state was a precursor to the second coming of Jesus. But this belief doesn’t negate the deep historic roots of American support for a Jewish state.
Moreover, religious fervor was coupled with sympathy for the Jews as being subject to the world’s most longstanding hatred. Abraham Lincoln wrote to a Christian Zionist that he hoped the oppression of Jews could be relieved by “restoring the [Jews] to their national home in Palestine” and that relieving such oppression was “a noble dream and one shared by many Americans.” This support was echoed from presidents as diverse as Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Herbert Hoover.
By the time World War II came to a close, both Houses of Congress called for a Jewish state, both parties had pro-Zionist platforms, and polls showed Americans supported a Jewish state by 2-1 margins. While some might see more hidden Jewish global power behind these levels of support, others would recognize that the Holocaust showed the limits of Jewish “hypnotic” power.
Strong American support for Israel continues to this day. Pew Research Center polls show that American support for Israel compared with the Palestinians has continued at close to a 3-1 margin over the past 50 years. The only difference is that, as is the case of many issues, the support has become more polarized, with 79 percent of Republicans sympathizing with Israel versus 27 percent of Democrats; Democrats are now as likely to sympathize with Israel as the Palestinians. As evidence that Jewish support for Israel is neither monolithic nor the mass of American support for Israel, the Pew polls show that white evangelicals (who represent more than 75 million) approve of greater U.S. support for Israel than American Jews.
While recent congressional critics of America’s support of Israel might dismiss this history, they cannot escape it. To be sure, they could make the point that seeking the imposition of a one-state solution pursuant to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, or otherwise being anti-Israel, cannot necessarily be conflated with being anti-Semitic. On the other hand, those who bring their greatest fervor to the condemnation of Israel should be mindful that criticizing Israel has become the intellectual “safe space” for engaging in anti-Semitism.
And those critics most recently elected to Congress might benefit from the admonition that Winston Churchill offered, in 1932, to a soon-to-be German chancellor who was condemning the influence of Jewish money: “Anti-Semitism may be a good starter, but it is a bad sticker.”

0,03/04/19 02:30 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/432493-identifying-the-roots-of-anti-semitisms-disturbing-reemergence,What's behind the disturbing reemergence of anti-Semitism?,"Anti-Semitism is undergoing a worrisome resurgence. The shootings at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh last October is part of a broader pattern:
the anti-Jewish slogans at the Charlottesville demonstration in 2017;
violent attacks on Jewish institutions in Belgium and France;
attempts to storm two synagogues in Paris during an anti-Israel riot;
assaults on Jewish men wearing the traditional kippa in the streets of Berlin.
Add to these examples the stunning prominence of alleged anti-Semitism in the Labor Party in the United Kingdom, as well as the alleged anti-Semitic rhetoric on the fringe of the Democratic Party in our own halls of Congress. How can we account for this return of an ancient hatred in the centers of the modern West?
Over the centuries, the distinctive feature of Jew-hatred has been its flexibility in changing its shape and mounting varied, mutually contradictory attacks: Anti-Semites can accuse Jews of being simultaneously capitalists and communists, plutocrats and beggars, or disloyally internationalist while narrowly clannish. Whatever Jews do, the anti-Semite finds grounds to object.
Three aspects of our historical moment are contributing to the virulence of the wave of attacks on Jews and Judaism. 
First, anti-Semitism today is one expression of the crisis of globalism. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the headwinds against globalization have grown stronger, as evidenced by rejections of free trade on the right and the left and re-assertions of national sovereignty in many regions of the world.
As suspicion of international arrangements grows, the archaic imagery of Jews as agents of international conspiracies has reemerged. 
The point is not that anti-globalism is inherently anti-Semitic. On the contrary, in this context of a retreating globalization, a simplistic political language has been revived that blames Jews without understanding the complex social processes at stake. Anti-Semitism is the anti-globalism of fools.   
Second, reversing historical trends toward secularization in the modern world, we are today witnessing a significant revival of religion: Evangelicals and Pentecostals, Hindu Nationalism, Islamic neo-traditionalism, and Jewish orthodoxy as well.
Yet this new vibrancy of religion faces an anti-religious backlash. In the United States, one can recall the anti-Mormon prejudice deployed against Mitt Romney
's presidential campaign, for example.
In Europe, Muslims face growing restrictions on their practices concerning the headscarf and halal meat. Today’s anti-Semitism is part of this picture: Hatred of Jews is, among other things, hatred of individuals identified by their religion.
Militant secularism can be deeply intolerant of all faith communities, harboring animosity toward anyone who is seen, to use the derogatory phrasing, as ""clinging to religion.""
Third, there is a spillover from the conflict in the Middle East and the politics around Israel. This is not new, of course. What is new is that the Palestinian question has lost its former centrality in the Arab world.
It is worth noting that, in response to the Trump administration’s decision to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, the major protests did not take place in Cairo or Baghdad but in European capitals. Meanwhile on American college campuses, a campaign has been mounted to boycott Israel to undermine its legitimacy. 
This type of politics aimed at terminating the Jewish state, which would render half of the world’s Jews stateless, is reasonably described as anti-Semitic.
There is an additional complexity in the United States. While American Jews, who are predominantly liberal voters, support the right of Israel to exist, they have been critical of Israeli policies.
In contrast, more robust support for Israel has deep roots in parts of the Christian Zionist community, especially among evangelicals.
Yet, while opponents of Israel protest in front of synagogues, they never demonstrate in front of churches that support Israel. This pattern of anti-Israel activism today reveals its anti-Semitism: its preference to attack Jews, even those who are critical of Israel, while overlooking Christians whose support of Israel may be even stronger. 
These three dimensions of anti-Semitism in relation to globalism, secularism and anti-Zionism indicate how the vilification of Jews today continues a long, polymorphous history.
It is wrong to attribute Jew-hatred to any single politician or political movement. Instead, we should avoid simplistic explanations for the complex challenges we face while remembering the importance of renouncing this and all other prejudices.

Countless editorials, roundtables, and expert segments all fed the perception that “Russia collusion,” an imprecise narrative shorthand for a nonexistent offense, would inevitably be proven. The left promised the puppet of Vladimir Putin would get his comeuppance in due time.
The problem is that this was all a lie. The biggest “bombshell” stories on Russia collusion reported thus far have all been either duds or outright fakes. The special counsel has yet to, and almost certainly will not, file any charges that prove Trump took part in Russia collusion. The overwhelming likelihood is, at worst, the special counsel report will contain unflattering information about the president and some of his close senior advisers.
Whatever Robert Mueller
has, it will not be the coup de grace to end the Trump administration and avenge Hillary Clinton
that the mainstream media has assured us was coming since November 2016. Now, with the investigation supposedly ending in a matter of weeks, if not just days, the collusion theorists are scrambling to deal with this reality. In a sane world, a lot of prominent voices on the left, in both politics and media, would be held accountable for stoking such partisan mass hysteria in our country.
How can the same Democrats and journalists who have been alleging for two years, without evidence, that the president is a criminal and a traitor come to terms with the reality of the hoax they have perpetrated out of petty partisan spite? They will not as they already have plans to move on to the next narrative con. This is where “obstruction” comes into play. Democrats have made it clear that, unable to prove the primary charges they used to hobble a presidency for two years, their follow up act will be to open new investigations and chase other charges around obstruction.
Without a hint of reflection or a twinge of good faith, the Democrats will pretend that all along the real problem with President Trump
has been his machiavellian interference in the justice system. This is as preposterous as it is dishonest. If Trump corrupted the Justice Department in his favor, he had a bizarre way of doing it. He never interfered with the special counsel investigation, despite its partisan bias and shady origins. He did not fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
, despite him richly deserving it. Trump did fire James Comey
, which Rosenstein had explicitly endorsed in writing. That of course led to the retaliatory move of appointing a special counsel. It was really the Justice Department that has obstructed Trump.
Are we supposed to ignore the convenient tactic of Democrats moving past collusion to obstruction? No serious person really believes that, as Mueller fails to uncover any illegal interference in government actions, some decidedly oleaginous characters in Congress like Adam Schiff
and Eric Swalwell
will. Mueller showed no hesitation in prosecuting peripheral figures in the Russia collusion drama for the most minor process crimes. Those who suddenly refuse to believe the special counsel was thorough enough have no interest in finding the truth. They never did to start with.
The playbook of Democrats has been obvious all along. They are merely weaponizing the investigative and prosecutorial functions of government for partisan ends, under the guise of “congressional oversight.” Moreover once Democrats tire of sermonizing under the capitol dome about the threat of obstruction, they will move along to his tax returns, business dealings, dangerously ample girth, or whatever else they can dream up.
Whatever one thinks of Trump, the ploys to take him down are not without cost. For anyone paying attention, it is hard to overstate the damage done to the credibility of federal institutions like the Justice Department in the scorched earth effort to end his presidency. While Congress is no stranger to low approval ratings, the circus like hearings that the Democrats plan to continue will do nothing to enhance the faith of the American people in it.
It is crystal clear those on the left have an unhealthy hatred for Trump and will leap at any excuse to remove him from office instead of waiting for the 2020 election. They neither respect the decision of the American people in the 2016 election nor their right to vote in the next one. The Democrats are hellbent on finding any way they can to take down Trump. They could care less about whatever they have to obstruct or destroy in the process.

0,03/01/19 06:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/432275-will-trump-risk-war-to-save-his-presidency,Will Trump risk war to save his presidency?,"Lost — temporally — in the Cohen testimony and the predictable collapse of the nuclear talks with North Korea, is the lesson we need to learn from the fabricated Mexican border ‘crisis’ and fake national emergency. It is this: President Trump
is prepared to inflict lasting damage on the country to save his presidency. 
As we try to impose fact and law on immigration policy, we need to apply this lesson in contemplating Trump’s next desperate act. The most worrisome scenario is a real but still manageable external crisis that arrives at a moment when escalation is in Trump’s political interest. Response mismanagement would fuel the crisis, but the real threat is a president motivated to hype a real crisis that his chaotic administration will be unable to control.
Such a possibility has risen from Hollywood cliché to serious risk and the odds of a ""wag the dog"" dynamic are increasing. Trump is in a deep hole and digging furiously. The political benefits of the wall will prove transitory, as construction bogs down in the courts and the latest caravan melts away. Between Mueller, mounting congressional scrutiny, low poll numbers, Republican desertions, further indictments of family and friends, impeachment (if not conviction) and an approaching election, the temptation to change the subject and rally his base by hyping an external threat could become irresistible. Backed into a corner and politically wounded, we can expect neither rational nor well-intentioned behavior from the president.
Unlike the slow moving and artificial crisis over the border, a real national security crisis, provoked by Trump or not, will move rapidly, present high, possibly existential risk, involve complexity, uncertainty and unintended negative consequences from ill-conceived policy choices. Consider Berlin blockades, Soviet missiles in Cuba, several global financial and economic crises, 9/11. Few presidents have avoided such perils and their presidencies — and the future of the country — have been defined by their responses.
Such episodes are exacting tests of precisely those qualities lacking in the Trump Administration: the rigor of policy process, the knowledge and skill of advisors, the confidence and mutual respect among and between policy and intelligence officials and the calmness of the president. Even with the best of intentions and effort, presidential performance has varied widely over our recent history.
At the extremes, JFK’s skillful management of the missile crisis produced a peaceful resolution, Soviet capitulation, an improved period in U.S.-Soviet relations and enhanced political standing for the president. George W. Bush’s response to 9/11 was to invade Iraq, arguably the worst strategic mistake since Vietnam and still paying negative dividends for ourselves and the Middle East.
We face an oversupply of potential crises and all offer ample opportunities for a president prepared to distort and manipulate external threats for political purposes. Iran could give up on the JCPOA and resume its nuclear program, reinforcing Iran-Israel conflict arising out of Syria and offering an opportunity for U.S. intervention; internal conflict in Venezuela could worsen and be attributed to hostile external influences; territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas could lead to a direct clash between U.S. and Chinese forces, as could a crisis precipitated by a Chinese move against Taiwan; there could be dangerous fallout from the failed nuclear negotiation with North Korea; Russia could move more boldly into Ukraine.
Some might challenge the likelihood of this scenario, based on Trump’s announcements (not yet implemented) of troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan, but his support for military restraint is not likely to survive his first exploitable crisis. His apparent preference for restraint is not the product of experience or deep conviction and-to his and our great fortune-has not yet been tested by crisis. His two closest advisors, Pompeo and Bolton, look favorably on the use of force to promote American interests and are spoiling for a fight with Iran.
The Bush precedent is instructive. An inexperienced president entered office with a declared preference for restraint in the use of force, opposition to nation building and support for collective action with allies. He then did a complete about-face in reaction to 9/11 and followed his neocon advisors into a unilateral, regime changing, nation building disaster in Iraq.
We must all recognize the problem we’re dealing with and get out in front of the dangers. Our president is a willful and heedless man who is personally inclined and politically motivated to seize any opportunity available to save his presidency. Managing a future crisis, even if he had the capacity, will not be his priority.
Capitalizing on it will be. Internal constraints on his behavior have all but disappeared and the enlarged presence of hard right advisors in his inner circle will generate further impetus towards escalation, especially if Iran provides the provocation. Our priority — in the public, the Congress, the press — is not to improve the administration’s decision-making skills, but to contain Trump’s instincts for doing harm.
We must reassert congressional war powers, require intelligence community confirmation of the factual basis of any administration war narrative, insist on defense department assessment of our capacity to carry out presidential policy preferences, place limits on the president’s authority to launch first use of nuclear weapons, scrutinize administration policy on emerging conflicts through public or closed hearings and — for the press — aggressively cover the administration’s reaction to emerging potential crises.

It is just business. But the fact is that you need the right personalities to do the business of politics. One announcement this week may have slipped your attention. But it could help determine whether Democrats are able to keep their House majority.
Robby Mook will become president of the House Majority PAC, which is the political action committee of the House Democrats. This is a big deal for numerous reasons. Next to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Majority PAC is quite arguably the most important political organization working to elect House Democrats. It raises funds, targets districts, buys time for campaign ads, and develops the message.
When I had chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2011, my very first decision was recommending to Nancy Pelosi
that we make him our executive director. Mook has what author John Gaddis had in mind in his book, “On Grand Strategy,” which is the ability to pursue a bold vision while adroitly managing unanticipated challenges along the way. Gaddis writes that some strategists are hedgehogs unalterably fixed on a grand goal but unable to manage obstacles, while some are foxes so fixed on minutiae that they lose sight of the end goal.
Mook is a true grand strategist because he can function while constantly reconciling those conflicts. He kept his eye on the 25 seats we wanted to win in 2012, but understood the unique terrain of individual districts. Even as our prospects for taking back the majority dimmed, Mook helped us make the strategic and tactical decisions that helped us pick up a net of eight seats, which was more than the pundits had assumed was possible.
He led with often undervalued qualities in campaign management. He built a cohesive motivated staff, worked longer hours than anyone else, trusted and empowered the people around him, and prioritized budgets by making sure our revenues went to where they mattered in competitive districts. That is a diplomatic way of saying the man was a tightwad. I once asked him if he would prefer two orange juice cans and a string to cut phone costs. Mook asked me how much time he had to think it over.
After a successful term directing the DCCC, Mook took one of the most challenging jobs in American politics when he was hired to be campaign manager for Hillary Clinton
. This role made him the most second guessed human on earth. I remember sitting with him at a restaurant in Manhattan when he was considering whether the job was right for him. He gave me all the reasons why he should not do it, followed by the only reason that he needed to sign up. He believed that Clinton should become president.
The 2020 election will be a complicated cycle for House Democrats. They have built a healthy margin but will be competing down ballot in a volatile and unpredictable cycle. Presidential coattails may be whipping erratically in shifting winds. That is when you need the very calm and cool campaign management of Mook. While his appointment as president of the House Majority PAC did not race in headlines across the front pages, it may lead to the headline that the party needs in 2020: “Democrats Keep Majority.”

0,02/26/19 02:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/431627-can-lindsey-graham-take-the-politics-out-of-judicial-battles,Can Lindsey Graham take the politics out of judicial battles?,"It is a turbulent time for the federal judiciary. Politicians from both sides of the aisle have attacked judges at all levels and questioned their motives. The president has gone after lower court judges for ruling against his administration and his personal business interests. Commentators have publicly decried the Supreme Court as “evil” and cynically labeled the third branch an “intensely partisan institution that pretends otherwise.”
Likewise, the nomination process has become chaotic and hyperpartisan. The confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh
is the latest example of its decline. Even now, Senate tensions remain high and could again erupt if an unplanned vacancy emerges on the Supreme Court. These tumults have left lasting governance scars. Confidence in the Supreme Court is down, and calls for radical reforms, such as court packing, have grown.
In this era of acrimony and distrust of the third branch, Lindsey Graham
began his new tenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Graham will lead the committee in considering judicial nominations by the president and any legislation touching on the federal judiciary. His record as a bipartisan dealmaker and steadfast supporter of the president has caught the attention of court watchers. Will he oversee two years of fast tracked judges and partisan votes, or will he conduct committee business with an eye toward reinstating bipartisan faith in the federal courts? Can Graham put the toxic political genie back in the bottle?
Thus far, his words and deeds have been promising. Importantly, Graham recognizes the underlying problem that there is an attempt, by both the left and the right, to transform the federal courts into blatantly partisan institutions. In a recent speech, Graham acknowledged that the country is in a “dark period” and warned that the politicization of the courts is “ever increasing and eventually is going to hurt the judiciary.” He declared that he would follow historical precedent holding that home state senators may veto the nomination of district court judges but not circuit judges, thus pushing back on political pressure to abandon the tradition entirely.
Some Senate Democrats have protested, noting that former committee chairman Patrick Leahy
observed the “blue slip” tradition for both district court nominations and circuit court nominations. In response, Graham told Senate Democrats that he will negotiate privately with them on circuit court nominations to seek a compromise with the president. Democrats will likely wait and see if the offer still stands should the opportunity arise.
Graham also has set his sights on restoring the judicial filibuster. In 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
at the time had invoked the “nuclear option,” removing the threshold of 60 votes for lower court nominees. Four years later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
took the very same action for Supreme Court nominees. As a member of the former “Gang of 14,” Graham has raised his fears that Senate partisanship could end the filibuster for all legislation instead of just judicial nominations.
Now that he is committee chairman, Graham has offered political support for restoring the judicial filibuster after the 2020 election, reasoning that it would be a fair restarting point. After all, he observed, “Nobody knows who is going to win.” Graham has also lamented the end of implementing the “qualifications test” for judicial nominees. He has noted that qualified conservative nominations and liberal nominations at one time could “sail through” the Senate. For example, Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg each received more than 90 votes in their confirmations.
Graham has also reminded us that during the last administration, he voted to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan not because he agreed with their legal views, but because they were indeed qualified to be Supreme Court justices. Democrats, however, remain dubious. They contend that they are given insufficient time to properly vet nominations. Moreover, they note that the Republican push to limit debate on certain nominations, including those for district court judges, demonstrates that any efforts to depoliticize the confirmation process is simply lip service.
It remains to be seen whether Graham can put the political genie back in the bottle. The politicization of the courts has been rising in our nation for decades, a problem caused not least by the tendency of the courts to take up divisive issues that should be settled by Congress. Until recent years, however, the committee was able to operate in a far more civil bipartisan manner. Graham has the opportunity to lead by example and remind his colleagues and the rest of us that the courts must remain above politics.

0,02/26/19 10:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/431557-the-case-for-nationalism,The case for nationalism,"The greatest strength of the United States has been the ability to accept different people from all over the world while maintaining the core themes of what it means to be an American citizen. Our belief in the Constitution, freedom, liberty, and justice triumphs over any noticeable differences in religion or ethnicity because it is understood that without those core tenets, this country could not exist in its current form. Despite this, the notion of love for country and the values that a country represents have seemingly been twisted in a negative by those who seek utopian bliss.
So how have we been led to believe that nationalism is a bad thing? The idea has been masked in confusion as of late and is one of the greatest casualties of the political battle between the left and right. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines the term “nationalism” as describing two phenomena: “the attitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their national identity” and “the actions that the members of a nation take when seeking to achieve (or sustain) self-determination.”
Those on the ideological left have gone out of their way to broaden the definition of classical nationalism with one of its negative variations, ethno nationalism, which is indeed different in that it prioritizes an ethno culture over all other ethnicities. Of course, ethno nationalism would never be accepted in this country because an overwhelming majority of us recognize the United States is made up of many different people.
University of North Carolina history professor Lloyd Kramer declared in a 2011 interview that like several other ideological “isms,” nationalism has aspects that are good and bad. In the United States, we have taken many measures to raise one form over the other, but to merge the two without making distinctions is disingenuous and runs afoul of the shared culture and traditions that all citizens of our country cherish and participate in.
In the case of nationalism in the United States, the good has outweighed the bad, and Americans have benefited tremendously. “When people feel committed to larger communities or interests or ideas of human rights and political progress, for example, nationalism can contribute to a sense of hope about the future. It can build positive personal and collective identities and a sense of selfhood in the modern world,” Kramer stated.
Political theorist Sir Roger Scruton reminds us, “Everything is imperfect, but the question is, what parts of what we have inherited can be improved and amended? What parts must be thrown away?” In the United States, citizens and statesmen alike have worked hard to improve and amend, as well as abandon in some cases, our normative inheritances. Whether they were born here or immigrated here, all Americans feel a sense of duty to strengthen the very idea of what it means to be a United States citizen.
According to Pew Research Center, a significant majority of Americans at 85 percent believe that the United States stands above all other countries in the world. This is critically important for a country that is as diverse as the United States because it is essential to preserving, protecting, and sustaining our American culture, which merges many cultures into one.
As more people seek to come to this country in search of the American dream, it is vital for the citizens of the United States to ensure the cultural values rooted in the American experience are preserved. The moment Americans cave to the extreme ideological forces that want to change our traditions will be the moment the United States experiences its demise.

0,02/25/19 06:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/431477-jussie-smollett-hoax-unveils-clear-double-standard-for-liberal-media,Jussie Smollett hoax unveils clear double standard for liberal media,"The Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax has once again brought the double standard of the liberal media and their role as propagandists into full view. His ridiculous tale of conservatives beating him up, yelling horrible racial and homophobic slurs, hanging a noose around his neck, and throwing bleach on his body was originally called “far right America’s endgame” by GQ Magazine. Of course, it later had to issue an embarrassing correction.
Across the country, media outlets reported his implausible allegations as fact, and even attacked the few conservatives who put their reputations on the line to call out his nonsensical story. According to Media Matters, questioning his lies was a “right wing smear.” But when the narrative went south, the response from mainstream media journalists was predictably defensive. CNN host Brian Stelter said “random websites” were trying to weaponize the hoax. MSNBC even went multiple days without mentioning the updates on the developing story during its primetime cable coverage.
But compare how the same outlets reported the politically motivated assault on White House counselor Kellyanne Conway
. There is a good chance you probably have not even heard the story of a deranged liberal screaming about President Trump
before allegedly grabbing Conway and shaking her as she tried to get a table at a restaurant because it never got a fraction of the media attention that was devoted to the staged and politically motivated attack that Smollett falsely reported to the police.
The general lack of coverage, however, is not even the real issue. What is striking is how differently the two stories were reported. The allegations made by Conway were much further along in the legal process than those of Smollett, with a suspect not only arrested and charged, but awaiting trial. Almost every news outlet, however, mimicked the Associated Press headline that Conway “claims” a woman assaulted her at the restaurant.
But that is not how they reported on the completely unsupported claims by the actor. “Jussie Smollett, star of Empire, attacked in what police call a possible hate crime,” read the New York Times headline, a theme that was echoed by other liberal media sites and further backed up by dozens of editorial pieces about how racist and homophobic Americans really are.
Or just look at the dearth of media coverage about the recent politically motivated assault against a campus conservative activist at the University of California at Berkeley. That attack was caught on video and involved injuries much more substantial than what Smollett sustained in his fake attack. Many liberal media outlets have not even bothered to cover the story of a young conservative getting punched in the face for his views.
The double standard makes sense when you recall that the mainstream media largely functions as a beacon of liberal thought. The story told by Smollett was perfectly aligned with the negative Trump coverage of many national reporters. They were incapable of exercising the same rational skepticism as normal people because it fit into their narrative too well.
It was only thanks to the intrepidity of local reporters and the excellent investigative work by the Chicago Police Department that we found out the truth behind the absurd false claims of Smollett. His hate crime hoax reminds us that partisanship can blind people to the truth, making this a destructive vice for those tasked with providing information to the public.

In this politically turbulent time, with its constant barrage of depressing news from Washington, Hollywood’s sympathies are well known, and often on very public display. What kind of fighting words might be uttered on national TV tonight? And what kind of retaliatory tweets will we see afterward? (There’s little doubt that most of the speeches won’t be complimentary of President Trump
.)
The only thing to look forward to — other than an extra-long, glitzy snorefest, with all 24 categories being televised, #AllAwardsMatter — is the unexpected.
Here’s what some of the nominees think about Washington politics, based on what they’ve said at recent awards shows or in public, and what may come out of their mouths. 
“AND THE BEST POLITICAL-COMMENTARY OSCAR GOES TO ... ” 
Christian Bale, for Best Undercut Shot at Donald Trump’s Intelligence: ""I think he thought I was Bruce Wayne, because I was dressed as Bruce Wayne. So he talked to me like I was Bruce Wayne and I just went along with it, really. It was quite entertaining. I had no idea at the time that he would think about running for president.”
Lady Gaga, for Most Pointed Anti-LGBT Concert Jab: ""And to Mike Pence
, who thinks it's acceptable that his wife works at a school that ban LGBTQ, you're wrong. [...] You say we should not discriminate against Christianity. [...] I am a Christian woman, and what I do know about Christianity is that we bear no prejudice, and everybody is welcome.” 
Willem Dafoe, for Most Subtle Donald Trump Ego-Pop: ""Our leader should be a moral leader, and I don't think we're going in the right direction, and we're a powerful country and we have a responsibility to the rest of the world. [...] In the rest of the world they think we're crazy and also, I think, the ’States has fallen in esteem."" 
Spike Lee, for Best Trump Nickname of The Year: ""Agent Orange, wake up! [...] He's a man of hate, violence and can't be trusted to make moral decisions. We can't be silent any more. He's on the wrong side of history.”
Viggo Mortensen, for Most Sarcastic Review of Donald Trump's Emergency Declaration: ""I am sorry that we are missing the pearls of wisdom of our dear leader, ‘Agent Orange.’ It must have been fascinating theater.”
Alfonso Cuarón, for Best Comment on ""The Wall"": ""The wall turns people into enemies for no reason. Walls are pointless. Whether there is a physical structure there or not, I'm more concerned with the invisible wall that divides social classes and backgrounds. That's a barrier we accept every day, without thinking.”
Emma Stone, for Best Humanitarian Remark: ""I think if we're human beings, and we see injustice, we have to speak up, because staying silent, as they say, only really helps the oppressor. It never helps the victim. So I think that, yes, right now, I would hope that everyone, when seeing things being done that are absolutely unconstitutional and inhumane, would say something, anything. Whether it's at school or at an awards show or work, offices, or online.""
Mahershala Ali, for Classiest, Most Nuanced Message: ""When we get caught up in the minutiae and the details that make us different, I think there's two ways of seeing that. There's the opportunity to see the texture of that person, the characteristics that make them unique, and then there's an opportunity to go to war about it and say that this person is different from me. I don't like you, so let's battle.""
Adam McKay, for Best Call-out of Money and the NRA in Politics: ""If a lap dog could serve in Congress, they would do whatever the gun lobby wanted for a piece of bacon or a doggy treat. But lap dogs can't be elected to Congress, so the gun lobby got these shameless congressmen to sit and roll over for campaign checks. They are good little doggies who don't give a hang about the safety of innocent Americans. It's time they were finally recognized for their blind obedience to the almighty dollar!""
Lady Gaga, again, for Best and Most Gun-Control Tweets, including: ""This is terrorism plain and simple. Terror [bears] no race, gender or religion. Democrats & Republicans please unite now. #guncontrol.""
Rami Malek, for Best Recognition of the Face of our Future: ""Deeply inspiring and reassuring that these humans (Emma Gonzalez and other Parkland school-shooting survivors) are the face of our future.""
Bradley Cooper, for Briefest Political Endorsement of a Presidential Candidate, referring to Beto O'Rourke
(D-Texas): ""I hope he runs. We need inspiration.""
Rachel Weisz, for Best Dual-Citizen Commentary: ""Trump is pretty catastrophic, and there are terrible things he can do to the Earth and women's rights, but I feel it will be reversible, somehow.""
Regina King, for Best Pledge to Take Action for Women: ""We all have the power as individuals to turn our complaints into action and our concerns into change. That's the message of the Time's Up campaign, and that's why I made a commitment during the Golden Globes to ensure that, within two years, women make up 50 percent of the crew for projects I produce. [...] This isn't simply a woman's issue. If you love your mama, then you need to be part of this movement!""

0,02/22/19 07:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/431221-can-progressives-govern,Can progressives govern?,"Two important events took place this month that raise a key question for progressive politicians and their supporters to answer. Can progressives govern? The first important event was the decision of Amazon to abandon its plan to locate a new corporate campus that would create 25,000 jobs in New York City. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
responded to that unnecessary economic debacle by publicly taking credit for it and gloating about her victory. In her words, “A group of dedicated everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon’s corporate greed.”
New York has successfully defeated lots of companies in recent years. Its business environment has become so hostile that a growing number of companies and citizens have voted with their feet. The high rate of exit from New York has cost it a dozen seats in Congress since 1970 and could cost it another seat in 2020. If New York follows the lead of progressives like Ocasio-Cortez, the rate at which companies leave will only accelerate. Many of the everyday citizens that Ocasio-Cortez represents will follow those companies to states with less hostile business environments. If that is the hallmark of progressive politicians, most Americans will reject the progressive agenda and those candidates for office who identify with it.
It is unfortunate that states and cities must negotiate special deals with companies to induce them to locate major facilities in their jurisdictions, but that is a part of the reality within which politicians must function. As Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio recognized, politicians must compromise in pursuit of some goals in order to attract and retain the private sector employers that are critical to the future welfare of a state or city. Politicians who remain unwilling to compromise to attract and retain employers under their watch are not capable of governing.
The second important event this month was the important vote for the compromise spending bill that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
negotiated with Republicans in Congress. Everyone knew the alternative to passing that legislation was another government shutdown. Yet, Ocasio-Cortez voted against the bill. She was joined by some Democratic senators who identify as progressives and who are now running for president in 2020.
If being a progressive means that you would rather close the government for an indefinite period of time than engage in the kind of compromise that is essential to a functioning legislative process, then progressives are not capable of governing. While the majority of voters in the Democratic primaries might prefer uncompromising politicians, the majority of the electorate prefers politicians who are willing to participate in the process of compromise that is essential to the ability to govern in a democracy.
The progressive movement certainly has laudable goals. Progressives want to take actions that will increase the availability of health care, reduce the trend toward increased disparities in wealth, and mitigate climate change. Politicians who share in the vision of the progressive movement need to decide whether they support or oppose compromise. If they oppose compromise, they are not capable of governing. Anyone who runs for office as an uncompromising progressive will, and should be, rejected by most voters. Candidates who combine progressive values with a realistic understanding of the essential role of compromise in governing a democracy can, and should be, embraced by most voters.

The poll was far from a free and fair election. The clear frontrunner according to independent polls, Martin Fayulu, was declared to have lost the race.
Subsequently, Felix Tshisekedi, the son of Congo’s most famous dissident for most of the nation’s 59 years of independence, was inaugurated on Jan. 24 after the Congolese Constitutional Court certified the official, but almost certainly fraudulent, vote tallies.
At one level, the election was an insult to democracy and a deep injustice to the Congolese people. Yet at another level, what just happened is a better outcome than most observers predicted.
Congo has now achieved the first peaceful transfer of power in its history — and to a new president who was not his predecessor’s first choice (President Kabila had favored a third candidate, Emmanuel Shadary). 
Moving forward, the choice for the international community is clear. Despite the tainted path by which Tshisekedi reached the presidency and the immense challenge of outgoing President Joseph Kabila’s continuing influence, the U.S., Europe and the African Union should strongly support the reform efforts that Congolese civil society leaders are calling for to transform the deeply entrenched kleptocratic state that Tshisekedi is inheriting. 
Two realms in which the U.S. and Europe should use their financial and diplomatic clout to induce reform in the DRC, as well as other nascent sub-Saharan African democracies, are in the military sector and on corruption. 
The U.S. and Europe have major financial leverage due to the heavy reliance of Congo’s economy on the U.S. dollar, and to an extent, the euro.
If the United States and European Union develop a strategy of using consistent financial pressure on corrupt actors in Congo’s violent kleptocratic state, there is a legitimate chance that Tshisekedi will be able to follow through on reforms to transform the rotten system. 
The financial tools include:
sanctions on corrupt officials, foreign facilitators and their corporate networks through use of the powerful U.S. Global Magnitsky Executive Order;
anti-money laundering measures such as Section 311 under the USA Patriot Act or a Treasury advisory to banks; and
asset-recovery tools.
For example, if the U.S. sanctions Official X because of his involvement in a $1 billion corrupt deal, it makes it easier for Tshisekedi to not name that person as a minister and then enact a transparency reform that would prevent such a deal from taking place in the future.   
In regard to the military, the United States and other countries should propose a vision for the reform of the Congolese military that, to date, has been highly abusive of civilians and unable to defeat multiple insurgencies in the east.
As a result, the world’s largest U.N. peacekeeping mission has become virtually a permanent, ineffectual fixture, while the DRC military continues to be plagued by many corrupt officers and bloated by abusive and poorly integrated former rebels.  
The US and Europe should offer Tshisekedi a deal: Reform his military, particularly in rooting out corrupt top brass and holding them accountable for abuses, and they will help build it up into a force that can ultimately exert sovereign control over the preponderance of the nation’s territory.
The United States could offer several hundred or more in-field military advisors as part of such an effort.
Regarding anti-corruption and accountability, the U.S. and Europe should urge Tshisekedi to start with four main reforms. First, Gecamines, the state-owned mining company at the heart of numerous corruption scandals, should publish its annual financial reports, undergo an independent audit, and its management should be changed.
Second, Tshisekedi should require all public officials to publicly declare their assets, starting with himself, a requirement under Congolese law that is rarely followed.
Third, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should restart an extended credit facility program in Congo, which would improve transparency in the central bank and improve Congo’s fiscal situation.
Lastly, Tshisekedi should insist that all mining and oil contracts, notorious for corrupt practices, are publicly disclosed, again as required by government decree but not practiced well. 
Additionally, efforts to put in place a robust accountability mechanism for human rights and financial crimes — long called for by Congolese civil society — would be important.
2019 could spell a new era for Congo and the wider region if the international community pivots strategies and uses its available leverage to push for meaningful reform. If so, Congo could finally move from being a klepto-state to one where rule of law takes much deeper root.

0,02/21/19 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/430977-lara-logan-is-right-about-media-bias,Lara Logan is right about media bias,"As a conservative, I cannot agree more with Lara Logan, the former CBS News foreign correspondent who recently confirmed what so many of us have been saying for decades, which is that the mainstream media in our country has an overwhelming liberal bias that excludes and dehumanizes millions of Americans. Many of her colleagues do not understand that a major reason why President Trump
won in 2016 is that many people were fed up with the liberal bias so widely prevalent in the mainstream media.
“Visually, anyone who has ever been to Israel and been to the Wailing Wall has seen that the women have this tiny little spot in front of the wall to pray, and the rest of the wall is for the men,” Logan said in an interview with retired Navy SEAL Mike Ritland. “To me, that is a great representation of the American media, in that in this tiny little corner where the women pray, you have Breitbart and Fox News and a few others, and from there on, you have CBS, ABC, NBC, HuffPost, Politico, whatever, right? All of them. That is a problem for me, because even if it were reversed, if it was vastly mostly on the right, that would also be a problem for me,” she said.
I applaud Logan for her refreshing honesty and wish her resolve as she faces backlash. She admitted, “This interview is professional suicide for me.” There is no denying that we have many courageous truth telling journalists who want to serve the public, and our hats are off to them as they inform and inspire us. But we also know that there are high levels of bias against President Trump, and many mainstream journalists do not provide balanced and accurate information regarding his administration.
This is reflected in the low levels of trust that the American people have in the media. Her comments are clearly seen in findings from Pew Research Center that 73 percent of Republicans believe that the mainstream media does not understand their views. A recent study by the Knight Foundation found that 49 percent of high school students have little to no trust in the news. A poll by Monmouth University last year also found that 77 percent of respondents believe that traditional media outlets publish fake news.
The number is up sharply from 2017, when 63 percent of respondents said the media was responsible for fake news. Among that group, 31 percent said they believed the media spreads fake news regularly while 46 percent said the media spreads fake news occasionally. A stunning 65 percent of respondents said fake news applies to how media outlets make editorial decisions and what they choose to report, while just 25 percent said fake news applies only to when media outlets spread inaccurate information.
What explains this trust gap? Only 7 percent of journalists said they are Republicans, according to a survey by Indiana University. This is far lower than the 24 percent of American adults who identify as Republicans. Pew Research Center conducted a national survey of more than 500 reporters, editors, and executives in 2004. The results showed that 34 percent of the media identified as liberal, while only 7 percent identified as conservative.
As a former journalist in the Washington press corps, I experienced this qualitatively. Many journalists in the elite Beltway milieu have spent their entire lives in liberal bubbles and do not have personal friends who are conservative. They do not have a deep understanding of conservative thought or our governing philosophy, which in turn leads to liberal bias.
In order to unify our country and rebuild our civic fabric, we must address this lack of trust in the media that Logan identifies. Trump calls out media bias and is the strongest industry watchdog that conservatives have had in decades. This in part helps explain his sky high approval ratings among Republicans. Even if journalists dislike him, they owe it to the American people to respect and give a fuller picture of his policy approach. They need to quit playing the role of activist and stick to the role of reporter.

The event at the Sixth and I Synagogue in Washington was moderated by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. As someone who has worked in virtually every Democratic campaign for president since 1968, I came away with some distinct impressions. Schultz is an engaging fellow with a compelling personal story. He is also very naive politically. He was asked about his potential role as a spoiler for the Democratic nominee, in the context of Ralph Nader costing Al Gore
the state of Florida and the election in 2000.
His response was twofold. First, he said he would not do anything to help President Trump
get reelected. Second, he believes that there is a great untapped potential of independent voters who could help an independent candidate win the presidency. This ignores the effect that independent candidate Ross Perot had in 1992. Perot won 19 percent of the popular vote against Democrat Bill Clinton
and Republican George Bush. Perot did not win a single electoral vote, but most observers believe that he took enough conservative votes away from Bush to tip the election to Clinton.
Every presidential election rests on electoral votes. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win. This is decided state by state on a “winner take all” basis, except in Maine and Nebraska, where electoral votes are allocated by districts. In 1992, the combined votes of Perot and Bush exceeded 50 percent in 21 states with 194 electoral votes. But Clinton won all 21 states with a plurality in each state and received all 194 electoral votes from those states. That was enough to put him over the top when added to other states he won. Clinton won Michigan with close to 44 percent of the vote, while Bush received short of 38 percent and Perot received more than 19 percent. Clinton won Ohio with 40 percent of the vote, while Bush received 38 percent and Perot received 21 percent.
Next year, it is certainly possible that the combined total for Schultz and Democratic nominee could exceed 50 percent in a number of key states and Trump could win all the electoral votes in those states with a plurality, just a Clinton did in 1992. I personally liked the result in 1992, but I would hate a comparable result favoring Trump in 2020. It is highly unlikely that Schultz could carry enough states to win the presidency. He might even wind up not carrying a single state, the same fate that Perot had suffered.
Another example of his political naivete was his response to the question of campaign finance reform. He railed against the current system and said he thought the public would support a major overhaul. Clearly, the current system stinks. However, Schultz ignored the fact that you cannot make major changes in the current system with legislation. The Supreme Court has held that campaign spending is a free speech issue and that limits on campaign spending violate the Constitution. In order to make a change, you need to amend the Constitution through a very difficult process. You cannot just waive a magic wand and change the entire system overnight.
Schultz has his heart in the right place. He wants to increase spending on public education and make sure everyone has access to affordable health insurance. Schultz is a moderate who wants to work across party lines. His problem is not with his heart but with his head. If Schultz really wants to have a chance of getting elected, he should join the people seeking the Democratic nomination. Michael Bloomberg considered the independent path and rejected that idea, so if he runs, it will be as a Democrat. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Schultz that a dose of reality cannot cure.

Caddell, who died Saturday at the age of 68, will be remembered for his intellect, his passion, and as an architect of modern day political consulting. However, to me, Pat was also a friend, a mentor, and someone for whom I had the utmost respect. Indeed, I knew a side of Pat that few did. While many often viewed him as angry and abrasive, I saw a caring and devoted family man who would have quite literally gone to any length for his children and grandchildren.
Pat was a revolutionary campaign strategist who redefined, and dare I say invented, political consulting. Indeed, the industry as it exists today would be remarkably different if not for his notable work and vision. His work on the Democratic primary campaign of George McGovern in 1972 earned him national acclaim, as his unique strategy enabled McGovern, a left wing populist candidate, to secure the party nomination, beating out his establishment rivals. Indeed, my own political consulting business model was based on the one that Caddell established and implemented in 1972.
Caddell is perhaps best known for the significant role he played in the stunning victory of Jimmy Carter in 1976, and he is the one credited with devising the innovative strategy that enabled Carter, a southern peanut farmer, to ascend to the highest office in the nation. Brilliantly, his strategy touched on the anger and resentment among voters at the time, painting Carter as an outsider who could heal the country after Watergate and the Vietnam War. In a rare and candid moment, campaign manager Hamilton Jordan confidently shared credit for their successful campaign, saying to a reporter, “You know why Jimmy Carter is going to be president? Because of Pat Caddell. It is all because of Pat Caddell.”
Perhaps better than anyone else, Caddell understood the depth of our democracy with all the good and the bad. Specifically, he had a sharp sense of the conflict and voter frustration that is an inevitable byproduct of our two party system. Specifically, he understood the concept of voter alienation and the anger of the electorate in a way that no one else ever had. His unique ability to understand the electorate led him to be one of the very few who foresaw the rise and ultimate victory of Donald Trump
.
Caddell also worked with Trump and his top strategic campaign advisers, namely Steve Bannon
and Kellyanne Conway
, to develop their strategy for appealing to voters during the 2016 campaign. Caddell truly understood exactly how powerful the slogan “Make America Great Again” was in 2016, and how the concept of “draining the swamp” resonated with voters who were angry, disenchanted, and felt left behind by the federal government.
Ultimately, Pat Caddell was many things. He was brilliant, passionate, and a true visionary. He revolutionized political consulting, and his work will instruct those who are involved in the highest levels of campaigns for centuries to come. He has left an indelible and undeniably distinct mark on the American political landscape, and he will be immensely missed.

0,02/18/19 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/430463-end-the-cannabis-banking-problem,End the cannabis banking problem,"Washington had a turning point in the national debate over banking and cannabis this month. For the first time, Congress held a hearing on the issue, with lawmakers and witnesses outlining the harm resulting from the growing gap between state and federal laws. The House financial services hearing was welcome but overdue. Today, 33 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis in some form, and more states are now moving to join that club. At the federal level, however, marijuana remains illegal, putting banks in an impossible situation only Congress can resolve.
Because marijuana remains illegal under federal law, most banks avoid serving cannabis businesses given the threat of federal enforcement and penalties. In the eyes of federal prosecutors, the funds from marijuana operations are illegal and processing them may be considered money laundering. As a result, banks are too often reluctant to take on the risk of doing any business that could cause them to be accused of any crime.
While banks generally do not take a position on legalization of marijuana, they respect the decisions made by voters in the states where it has been legalized. Those voters had weighed the societal and cultural issues that come with legalization, and they made their decision. Instead, the industry is focused on the impact of the gap between state and federal laws on banks and their ability to serve those in their communities.
The hearing underscored the risk to public safety, financial accountability, and the efficient collection of taxes. It is time for Congress to reconcile that divide so financial institutions have the certainty they need to serve businesses that are legal in their states. It is a position banks do not take lightly, and it reflects feedback received from banks across the country. An industry survey found that 99 percent of respondents want Congress to bridge the divide between state and federal laws, regardless of whether they operate in a state that has legalized cannabis or whether they intend to serve the industry. Banks simply want the cannabis conundrum to end so they can serve their customers and communities as they always have.
It is not just banks asking for lawmakers to take action. A bipartisan group of 19 state attorneys general last year asked Congress to reconcile the gap between state and federal laws. In a letter to lawmakers, they argued that bringing cannabis businesses into the banking system would improve accountability and increase public safety. Without relief from Congress, even banks that have decided not to serve cannabis businesses will find themselves caught in the financial web created by this booming industry. The money from cannabis businesses often goes to vendors, landlords, and employees, while the federal criminal association follows that cash.
Recently, a bank in Ohio was forced to turn down a loan to a fencing company hired to build a fence around a marijuana growing facility. A bank in Washington had to close an account when a law firm took on a marijuana business as a client. If either of these banks looked the other way, they risked violating federal law and facing criminal prosecution. These examples are not isolated. The survey found that 75 percent of banks have had to close an account, terminate a client relationship, or turn away a customer because there was some connection to cannabis.
Reconciling the legal divide between state and federal laws would bring benefits to the communities banks serve. The estimated $24 billion in cannabis sales by 2025 in states where marijuana has been legalized could be deposited safely with federally regulated financial institutions, enhancing transparency, public safety, and tax revenue. New bipartisan legislation introduced in the House marks an important first step toward bringing cannabis businesses into the mainstream financial sector. The bill and the hearing this month are encouraging, and Congress can craft a law that can achieve the legal certainty that states and businesses need.
This issue provides Congress an opportunity to demonstrate that divided government can still solve serious problems when our lawmakers of good faith work together. Ending the cannabis conundrum will not be easy, and banks respect differing views on legalization, including within the financial industry. Still, a majority in this new Congress should be able to agree on the need to clarify the rules of the road for financial institutions. Banks across the country pledge to do what they can to help solve this issue.

Although some people might not want to acknowledge this obvious fact, Clarence Thomas is the highest ranking African American government official in the United States today.
Thomas is the senior associate justice on the Supreme Court, having served since 1991. His legacy is inevitably tied to the allegation during his confirmation hearing that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill during their tenure together at the Education Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It is an allegation that Thomas categorically denied and famously described during the process as part of a “high tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.”
Thomas has been vilified by many in the intelligentsia for the entirety of his nearly 30 years on the Supreme Court. Time Magazine had once appallingly referred to him as “Uncle Tom Justice,” and the late political columnist Nat Hentoff opined during the early years of his service on the bench that Thomas had “done more damage, more quickly, than any Supreme Court justice in history.” But three decades is a long time, and it would be a mistake to underestimate his impact on constitutional law.
His most lasting influence is almost certainly going to be on civil rights law, something that is particularly important to note during Black History Month. In Missouri versus Jenkins, for example, Thomas became the first justice to directly criticize Brown versus Board of Education. Although he called state mandated segregation “despicable,” Thomas said that the Supreme Court was wrong to rely on debatable and disputable social evidence to declare segregation unconstitutional rather than invoking the “constitutional principle” that the government “must treat citizens as individuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic, or religious groups.”
His conception of civil rights as an individual, not a group, right also explains his approach to voting rights. In Holder versus Hall, he wrote that racial groups should not “be conceived of largely as political interest groups,” that African Americans do not all think alike, and that existing case law should be overturned to eliminate claims for “proportional allocation of political power according to race.” He echoed these views in several subsequent cases, including Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One versus Holder and Shelby County versus Holder.
Of course, Thomas is best known for insisting that racial preferences are bad policy and bad law. Indeed, it was during his tenure as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the 1980s that it had shifted from a group based approach to civil rights enforcement to an individual based approach. Furthermore, it was his rejection of group based relief in civil rights cases, particularly affirmative action, that led liberal civil rights groups to oppose his elevation from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia up to the Supreme Court.
Thomas has strived to convince a majority on the Supreme Court that racial preferences are unconstitutional. His most significant opinions include Adarand Constructors versus Pena, Grutter versus Bollinger, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number One, and Fisher versus University of Texas. In these opinions, Thomas argued that our commitment to the ideal of inherent equality memorialized in the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence that “all men are created equal” means every person should be judged as an individual rather than as a member of a certain racial or ethnic group.
The #MeToo movement wants Thomas impeached and removed from the Supreme Court for the allegations during his confirmation hearing nearly three decades ago. Sonia Sotomayor, his liberal colleague on the bench, paints a much different picture of the highest ranking African American government official in the United States. “He knows the name of every single employee in the building,” Sotomayor said at Vanderbilt University last year. “I can stand here and say I just love the man as a person. He has the same value toward human beings as I have despite our differences.”
Black History Month reminds us that every African American indeed has a compelling life story to tell. Clarence Thomas, who rose from a dirt poor town in Georgia during his youth to the marble temple of the highest court in the land, certainly does. Hopefully our country will realize that.

0,02/12/19 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/429652-green-new-deal-is-good-economics,Green New Deal is good economics,"After years of failing to pass a carbon tax, climate hawks are now rallying behind a bold new proposal for tackling global warming. Known as the Green New Deal, this economic stimulus package for the planet promises to dramatically cut carbon emissions through government spending on clean energy jobs, technologies, and infrastructure. The main selling point of the Green New Deal has been its politics. While carbon pricing has long been touted as the most cost effective policy for reducing emissions, it has struggled to gain legislative traction. By contrast, advocates of the Green New Deal believe their proposal can build a winning coalition by reframing climate policy as a story of economic growth and opportunity.
A Green New Deal is not just good politics. It is good economics. Society can combat climate change by using existing clean technologies to cut emissions today or by innovating new clean technologies to cut emissions in the future. We need both strategies to address global warming. Every second that we delay in reducing our carbon footprint imposes costs on ourselves and on countless future generations. If we want to avoid climate catastrophe, we need to make deep cuts in emissions soon. On the other hand, the challenges and costs of relying solely on current technologies to address climate change are prohibitively high. We need investments in clean innovation to make it cheaper to reduce emissions in the future.
We could achieve the twin goals of slashing emissions and spurring innovation by putting a very high price on greenhouse gases. Carbon taxes can encourage industries to both reduce their footprints and develop cheaper clean technologies. However, carbon pricing by itself is not the most efficient climate policy. As we explain in a recent paper, the cheaper and faster approach for our society is to combine a moderately sized carbon tax with significant federal spending on the development and deployment of clean technologies. While carbon pricing is the most cost effective way to reduce emissions today, government subsidies are the most cost effective way to advance clean technologies tomorrow.
The intuition behind all this is simple. Policies work best when they are narrowly tailored to the behavior that they seek to alter. Thus, if we want markets to produce more clean innovation, we should reward innovators rather than penalize polluters in the hopes that doing so will indirectly induce them to produce innovation. The benefits of directly encouraging clean innovation are striking. Economists have estimated our society can save more than $1.4 trillion a year if governments used a combination of taxes and subsidies, rather than taxes only, to address climate change.
In short, good economics calls for the type of broad federal spending on clean innovation that the Green New Deal promises to deliver. Of course, the effectiveness of the proposal at spurring innovation will depend on its design, the exact details of which have yet to be ironed out. The package should increase funding for early stage clean energy research, as this kind of basic science is usually too risky to attract private investors. The Green New Deal should also include subsidies for the adoption and deployment of clean technologies, such as tax credits for clean energy investment and manufacturing. These types of policies that help emerging technologies scale up and mature can be powerful drivers of clean energy innovation.
Critics will undoubtedly argue that we cannot afford the Green New Deal. This line of attack, however, ignores the costs of inaction. While the Green New Deal will not be cheap, its price pales in comparison to the damage that unchecked climate change will inflict on the economy. This argument also ignores the savings that will result from the push toward clean energy innovation under the Green New Deal. The development of cheaper clean technologies should more than offset the costs of the stimulus package.
Opponents will also claim that the government is a bad venture capitalist, and that a Green New Deal will pour taxpayer dollars into clean energy boondoggles. While concerns about government waste are certainly real, they can be avoided through smart policy design. The government can encourage innovation without favoring particular clean technologies or companies by enacting neutral research and development tax credits.
The ideal economic climate policy does include carbon pricing. But we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Even if the government cannot enact the best policy for cutting emissions today, it can still use the best policy for advancing clean innovation tomorrow. The Green New Deal pushes climate policy into uncharted political waters, but it does so based on sound economic theories. If we want to save the planet for the least amount of money, we need the Green New Deal, and we need it now.

0,02/11/19 06:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/429478-does-innocent-until-proven-guilty-mean-anything-in-public-opinion,Does innocent until proven guilty mean anything in public opinion?,"“Innocent until proven guilty.” We have all said this many times. We have surely heard it many more. But what does it really mean? Has the concept been corrupted by modern day politics and the court of public opinion? In ancient Rome, the presumption of innocence was expressed through the Latin maxim “ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat,” which means “the burden of proof lies on him who alleges, not upon him who denies.”
In the United States, this presumption of innocence has long remained a sacred legal principle in the criminal justice system for over a hundred years. Under this protection, the prosecution has the obligation to prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence has saved many men and women from the injustice of false accusations and from serving time for crimes that they did not commit.
Unfortunately, the court of public opinion today has served as a vastly different outlet for punishment with no presumption of innocence at play, something that Washington operatives have capitalized on in the dirty fights for more political power. Innocent until proven guilty? It now seems a lot more like innocent until proven political in the court of public opinion these days. The minute a political leader is publicly accused of a crime, such as sexual assault, the presumption of innocence that would usually be in the back of our minds is suddenly tossed out the window.
The downfall of someone on the other side of the aisle fits perfectly in the very partisan minds of many Americans. Common sense and independent thinking are thrown to the wind and replaced by cruel judgments, vocal public backlash, and parroting of false information that often stems from political opposition efforts. The elimination of a government figure too often plays into larger political schemes run by Washington operatives.
We do not have to look far for examples of this. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh
was accused of sexual assault with zero evidence to support the claims and went through a tortuous nomination process because of it. With no presumption of innocence at play in the court of public opinion, he was labeled as guilty on social media and attacked by television commentators and political opponents. His reputation was permanently soiled and irreparable damage was done to the country.
Did these people attack Kavanaugh because they had actual evidence or proof that he was guilty of sexual assault? Of course not. Did his political adversaries truly believe that he was a rapist? I highly doubt it. Instead, what they saw was an opportunity for their side of the aisle to benefit. The truth is that many of his political opponents jumped on the best chance they had to turn the nomination process into an attempt to take down his legal career without looking at the facts or using basic common sense.
After his confirmation, one accuser admitted that “her actions were part of a ploy to take down” his nomination. Innocent until proven guilty? He was innocent until it was proven beneficial for him to be guilty. Crimes, like sexual assault, are not and should never become partisan issues. We should never trust accusers with a blind eye because their accusations are against our political adversaries, just as we should never turn a blind eye to accusers because their accusations are against our political allies.
At the end of the day, justice must be blind. We must always search for truth both inside and outside of our courts. Nobody deserves or would ever want to be treated the way Kavanaugh was treated last fall. With the latest sexual assault allegations now leveled against Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, I hope people will step back and afford him the proper benefit of the doubt that Kavanaugh was not given. Innocent until proven political could be the new standard, but it does not have to be.

, the promise of Ancestry.com to use DNA to “celebrate how we all came to be” must have had a distinctly loathsome meaning this week. On the day of her highly anticipated announcement as a Democratic candidate for president, Warren is facing new questions in her long standing controversy over claims of Native American ancestry.
New allegations concern the discovery of a Texas legal bar registration form from 1986, on which Warren listed herself as “American Indian.” This claim of race, in her own handwriting, showed an unsolicited invocation by Warren that she is a person of color. However, her ancestry story has highlighted an even larger controversy over what actually constitutes minority status and how such claims of race can or should be confirmed.
Politicians and celebrities often seek compelling personal narratives of overcoming adversities or challenges. Warren has been dogged by other past claims. She once declared herself the first “nursing mother” to take the New Jersey bar exam, which seems not only unprovable but unlikely, since the first female lawyer in the state received a license back in 1895.
I have long had mixed feelings about the ancestry story told by Warren. Suggestions that Warren used her claimed status to secure academic positions is unproven. Her claim that she is a minority was not the reason for her considerable success as an academic. Warren has not only won teaching awards as a law professor but her writings on bankruptcy and financial markets made her a sharp intellectual with global reach. That does not mean such claims do not raise ethical or professional issues.
The Coalition of Bar Associations of Color passed a resolution several years ago calling on law schools to treat the practice of “box checking” minority status as academic “ethnic fraud.” Warren listed herself as a minority on the Association of American Law Schools directory and had her ethnicity changed from white to Native American at the University of Pennsylvania. She was listed as a minority at Harvard, which publicly highlighted her as a “Native American” law professor. The Fordham Law Review identified her as the “first woman of color” at Harvard, and she identified herself as “Cherokee” in a cookbook called “Pow Wow Chow.”
Warren rekindled the controversy over her minority status after making public a DNA test that showed a possible fraction of Native American heritage. Stanford University Professor Carlos Bustamante found that Warren may be 0.09 percent to 1.5 percent Native American. That is quite common and would place any of her possible ancestors between six to 10 generations back. If her great-great-great-grandmother were full Native American, Warren would be 1/32 Native American, but it could date back further to 10 generations, thus making her only 1/1,024 Native American.
The response from Native American groups who denounced Warren for using DNA to show ancestry was interesting. Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin insisted that “using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.” Warren privately apologized to the tribe for using a DNA test to establish status as a Native American.
The suggestion here is that actual DNA is not the measure of ancestry for Native Americans. Hoskin said that the tribe uses DNA to resolve issues of “paternity to an individual” but that “it is not evidence for tribal affiliation.” Notably, Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker is 1/32 Cherokee by blood. Yet, such ancestry is key to claiming not just minority status but also eligibility to share in revenues and benefits from tribal accounts and enterprises. The standards differ from tribe to tribe. Michael Woestehoff of the National Indian Gaming Association has explained that membership in the Navajo Nation requires that a person have 1/4 or more Navajo blood.
The same controversy rages on at universities, which do little to confirm minority status, making such “box checking” on college applications a self identification process. The Census Bureau approach is based solely on self identification. Since 2000, it has allowed people to check multiple boxes for races and ethnicities. Brown University attracted attention for proposing a pure self identification system for “people of color.” A host of programs can hinge on minority status, from government contracts to academic admissions to employment opportunities to financial benefits. Yet, the basis for claiming minority status remains fluid and uncertain.
When George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin, the shooting was portrayed as a white man who killed an African American youth, even though Zimmerman is half Hispanic. Jefferson Fish, author of “Myth of Race,” suggested that Zimmerman could be defined as black because he is 1/32 black from family on the side of his mother. Nonetheless, Fish insisted that “Zimmerman’s race is a matter of cultural, not biological information. So different American subcultures classify him differently.”
That, however, does not answer how race should be legally confirmed when substantial financial, academic, and professional benefits are at stake. It seems clear to most of us that Warren should not have claimed minority status, but there is little agreement on why. The criticism of her use of a DNA test to establish her ancestry begs the question of how to objectively answer such questions. Can anyone be “culturally” part of a race or ethnicity, or is that the ultimate form of cultural appropriation?
On the one side, there is the repugnance of accepting the notion of the “one drop rule” in some states that any African blood makes someone black. On the other side, there is the understandable resistance to those people like Warren claiming to be a person of color due to having as little as 0.09 percent DNA from an ancestor who has Native American blood.
It is far from clear that her claim of being a person of color is the story of “how she came to be” a leading academic. However, it is clear how this came to be the primary subject for Warren in her bid for the presidency. Voters will decide the extent to which they view the earlier claims to be disqualifying. Yet, that is just one job dispute. We still have to decide how to deal with such claims for thousands of other applications or positions.
That may prove to be what is most discomforting for many. This question has been carefully avoided for years at universities and other institutions. Schools want to boost minority enrollment and agencies want to benefit marginalized groups. What they are not eager to do is face the difficult question on how such claims should be confirmed. While hardly her intention, Warren may have now forced that long delayed discussion.

0,02/06/19 10:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/428698-a-tale-of-two-trumps,A tale of two Trumps,"The State of the Union address presented two versions of Donald Trump. I have often wished that the nation could be governed by the teleprompter Trump instead of the impulsive Trump. The former showed up last night, appearing at times restrained, aspirational, and tempered. “We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future,” he said. Amen.
The other President Trump
appeared as well. He was uncompromising and took a hard line, painting a dark picture of an America about to be invaded by MS-13 gangs and turned into a socialist state. One version of Trump brought us to a collective high in recognizing World War II veterans. The other fell flat with contortion and obsession. “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,” Trump declared.
He was not the only contradiction in terms. The House chamber was filled with fiery Republican ovations and icy Democratic glares. There were flashes of spontaneity, like when Trump boasted about women filling “58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.” Female lawmakers dressed in solidarity in white, many of whom now have jobs as members of Congress because they ran in response to his record on women, rose in celebration. “Great,” Trump said, “Really great. Congratulations.”
The irony may have been lost on Trump, but it was a bonding moment. Every State of the Union is grand vision and tactical pivots. Presidents reach out to the opposition with one hand and pound them with the other. The rhetoric soars but, like bubbles from a wand, pops quickly in the air.
But this State of the Union reflected a deeper bipolarity in the electorate. Buffeted by the financial crisis a decade ago, we have swung wildly in our political choices. In 2008, we elected Barack Obama
. In 2010, we elected a Tea Party Congress to block him. In 2012, we reelected Obama. In 2014, we retained a Republican majority to check him. In 2016, we elected Donald Trump. In 2018, we generated a Democratic House to stop him.
The great seal of the republic should feature a neck brace. The country is not divided as much as it is uncertain. There is broad public consensus that wages are stagnating, medical costs are skyrocketing, corruption is deepening, and infrastructure is decaying. The 2008 economic meltdown whacked the middle class on its heads, and we have been in a collective daze, stumbling in search for the right cure for our deep national wounds.
Some of the prescriptions mentioned last night will help. Yet others are bromides, while still others will do more harm than good for the country. The State of the Union is volatile. It will take much more than a scrolling teleprompter to stabilize America. Those are simply sounds of silence.

0,02/03/19 11:30 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/428232-progressives-pulling-a-bait-and-switch-with-medicare-for-all,Progressives pulling a bait-and-switch with 'Medicare for All',"Politicians are known to misrepresent themselves to get elected, but Sen. Bernie Sanders
(I-Vt.) is supposed to be an exception. It is said that he has remained true to his socialist convictions through thick and thin.
Surely, such a dedicated socialist can truthfully explain what socialism is. If not he, then Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.), the influential newcomer to Congress and member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), could lend a hand. She must know what socialism is if Bernie won’t speak up.
Prepare for a surprise. Sanders has consistently claimed that his socialism is a Scandinavian-type welfare state. He assures voters that his socialism is comprised of free medicine and education and a fair distribution of income, nothing more, nothing less.
Ocasio-Cortez rattles on about giving things away free and that capitalism is rotten. If pressed, she turns to recipes and social-media tips.
Those who wish for a clear definition of socialism from Sanders or Ocasio-Cortez are left with two possible interpretations: Either they have no idea, or they fear voters would be repelled if they came clean.
With a majority of the Democrat base now claiming to prefer socialism to capitalism, a flood of leftist Democrats (some newly minted) are seeking to co-opt Sanders’ platform of free this and free that. As they roll out their presidential-primary campaigns, they jostle to outbid each other in giveaways and taxing the rich.
That’s all we are going to hear from the left’s socialist crowd on the campaign trail. For those who wish to delve into what socialism really is, here are my key takeaways after having perused the DSA website: 
First, socialism gives free medical care, education, retirement and other requisites of a welfare state to all. 
Second, socialism will cripple private ownership of business enterprises. ""Consumer representatives,"" worker collectives or state-run agencies will replace private owners. 
Third, wise technocrats, not private consumers and producers, will decide what is in the public interest because the public interest prevails over private interest. 
Fourth, large enterprises will be planned for the public good not directed by private profit.
Fifth, capitalism must be checked because it exploits women, minorities, gays, immigrants and a whole list of downtrodden folks.  
The DCA description of socialism represents the consensus view of its 50,000 members, including, we assume, Ocasio-Cortez. It spells out how to construct a socialist America in the abstract, but we have two proposed pieces of legislation that dictate how to restructure American medicine in practice.
We are curious whether these proposed pieces of legislation are consistent with or are derived from the DSA’s version of socialism.
In September 2017, Bernie Sanders and 13 Senate co-sponsors (including five current Democrat presidential candidates) put forward the ""Medicare for All Act.""
In March 2018, 124 Democrat “progressive” members of Congress co-sponsored House Resolution 676 (HR676),  also entitled “Medicare for All.” The Senate and House bills are similar, but we focus on HR676 and ask whether the key provisions of “Medicare for All” follow the DSA model of socialism. 
Here are the features of HR676: 
Free giveaways:  HR 676 makes health care free to all U.S. residents. (The “secretary” decides who is a resident). Moreover, all conceivable medical services (opticians, dentists, chiropractors, doctors, surgeons, medicines, hospitals, etc.) are covered.
Eliminate private health insurance: “It is unlawful for a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act.” HR 676 includes all conceivable medical benefits; therefore there is nothing left to insure. Health insurance, including employer plans, ceases to exist. 
Eliminate for-profit providers: “No institution may be a participating provider unless it is a public or not-for-profit institution.” All for-profit, medical-related practices must be converted to non-profits or government ownership. They are somehow to be compensated for their losses in what promises to be a massive expropriation. 
Hand control of all health-care decisions to the government: A mammoth VA-like bureaucracy will determine who is eligible, set compensation of medical providers, determine what services are covered, root out back-alley private providers and so on.
“Medicare for All” provides a revelatory snapshot of Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and, increasingly, the left of the Democrat party. It seeks to destroy private businesses that provide medical care, the most important victim being private health insurance.
HR 676 replaces market allocation with bureaucratic decision-making and control. A giant bureaucracy, not the people affected, determine what is in the public interest and what is not. All of these provisions feature prominently in the DCA version of socialism.
If enacted, HT 676 would deliver a potentially fatal shock to our medical care system that accounts for one-fifth of the economy.
Medicare for all has been the Holy Grail of the left for decades. We could perhaps dismiss HR676 as an election stunt. Do not be so confident. HR676 could become law if American voters pay no attention and fall for the false promise of a Swedish or Danish-style welfare state.
Realize that Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and the socialist wing of the Democrat party are employing a “bait and switch.” They are pretending to be European-style Social Democrats not socialists, as defined by DSA.
The European welfare state is the product of European Social Democrats who fought for improved working conditions, pensions and health care, while keeping private ownership and a market economy intact.
Some 90 percent of the Swedish economy is privately owned, and all three Scandinavian countries outperform the U.S. in business freedom. In the process, Social Democrats forged an eventual consensus with their conservative counterparts that the “social state” (Sozialstaat) is here to stay, despite its huge cost.
That political battle is still proceeding in the United States, whose electorate does not relish the astronomical payroll and value-added taxes required to pay for the social state.
""Medicare for All,"" if properly explained, should markedly increase the chances of Donald Trump
’s re-election. The media has already figured out that ""Medicare for All"" outlaws the employer health insurance of 170 million Americans and that medical resources may cover 44 million currently on Medicare but would be insufficient for 325 million. 
Tough decisions lay ahead for the Democrat presidential candidates.

0,02/01/19 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/428098-federal-reserve-faces-dilemma-after-the-pleasantly-surprising-jobs-report,Federal Reserve faces dilemma after the pleasantly surprising jobs report,"The employment situation report today is a pleasant but puzzling surprise that poses an important dilemma for the Federal Reserve. The economy created 304,000 new jobs last month, which is far more than the 170,000 consensus of forecasters. Considering that the federal government was in a shutdown for over a month, with 400,000 employees idle at home and another 400,000 working without pay, this upward move was indeed welcome. Other indicators in the latest jobs report were positive as well.
The number of hours worked throughout the economy increased, which is another sign of growing production. Hourly and weekly worker pay also increased. Rising wages are obviously good for current workers, but they also send a signal to those adults on the sidelines of the labor market that opportunity is growing. In that vein, although the number of persons unemployed went up, which is not a big surprise given the furloughed government employees, the percentage of the adult population that was either working or seeking to work ticked up by one tenth of a percent.
That is important because it gives the economy the new workers it needs to fill the places of the aging baby boomers who are exiting the labor market in droves. Across the economy, employment went up almost everywhere, including in the traditional goods producing sectors that provide jobs for many of the workers who lost their places during the aftermath of the financial crisis. That again is a good sign for the labor market overall as it is squeezed by the retirement of baby boomers.
This jobs report is great news, but it is also puzzling. Over the last few months, many economists have questioned the durability of the current expansion and have urged the Federal Reserve to put its interest rate hikes on hold. This pitted these “inflation doves” against other economists who are more optimistic. Among this latter group are some who fear that our interest rates have been too low for far too long, creating market bubbles, distorting the economy, and planting seeds for a potential financial crisis. The central bank reflected those concerns in its recent rate increases.
Just a few days ago, the Federal Reserve reacted to those dovish fears of an economic softening because of the trade wars, the Brexit dispute, and the government shutdown by announcing steady rates with soothing language. But today, despite those worries, the labor market has roared back in this most recent jobs report. So what should the Federal Reserve do? Unfortunately, it remains caught between a rock and a hard place.
For decades, elected policymakers for the most part have respected the independence of the Federal Reserve. As a result, it has gained credibility with the financial markets as an inflation fighter. That solid credibility is an extraordinarily valuable asset. If the markets trust the central bank to hold inflation in check, that gives business the confidence to keep their prices steady. But in recent months, Washington has taken to publicly criticizing decisions by the Federal Reserve. This threatens its credibility and raises a chance that the central bank bends to the will of elected policymakers.
When the Federal Reserve perceived that the strong economy faces new downside risks and signaled a pause in raising interest rates at its last meeting, there was immediate financial market reaction that the central bank caved to political pressure. It does not matter whether the Federal Reserve is in fact simply making a neutral economic policy judgment based on the data. If its credibility is questioned, it may have significant costs in the future. If so, rebuilding its credibility could lead to greater monetary restraint and reduced economic prosperity. The jobs report has thrown the central bank yet another curveball. More jobs means great news, but it makes the mission of the Federal Reserve a little bit harder.

0,01/28/19 09:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/426711-5-criteria-for-hiring-americas-next-chief-executive,5 criteria for hiring America’s next chief executive,"Election fever is red hot. A half-dozen Democratic hopefuls have declared their candidacy or are about to, and an equal number of Republicans are itching to take up the mantle, if President Trump
bows out in 2020. We are deluged by articles about likability, positioning, identity politics, intra-party iconography. Some candidate bio-books are out, and one suspects that guidebooks to Iowa and New Hampshire are selling like hotcakes.
Before the frenzy peaks, Americans need to step back from normal campaign noise and ask what criteria we should use to hire a president, the chief executive of our federal government and leader of what still can be called the free world.  
We need to forget the hype and social media manipulation, and vote on solid criteria. “We, the people” are the greatest hiring committee in the world. Here are five hiring criteria we should use.
The first criteria is character. The next president should have all the classical virtues: honesty, integrity, sobriety, charity, generosity of spirit, and a high sense of purpose. He or she must have demonstrated the values of patriotism, selfless service to the nation, and devotion to the general welfare that our greatest presidents have shown.
The second criteria is vision and empathy. Does the candidate see the whole set of problems? Can he or she create comprehensive solutions with fairness for every American? Bonus points go to the candidate who can connect his or her work with the Founders and tie policies to the high-minded ethical principles shaped by our most profound religious traditions.  
The third criteria is education. Today’s problems are complex by any measure. A solid bachelor’s degree is a minimum, with best qualified applicants having advanced degrees. More important than degrees, the next president should be a lifelong learner who uses his or her mind to study issues and come up with creative solutions. John F. Kennedy reminded his cabinet that there are no schools to teach you how to be president, but there are educational and job experiences, as well as habits of the mind, that can help the next chief executive solve complex problems and learn from mistakes.
The fourth criteria is demonstrated experience. There can be no standard list of experiences for candidates, but the next president should have some sort of large-scale managerial experience. Running a legislative office and managing election campaigns are, by themselves, insufficient experience for governing. Being a CEO, a governor, a mayor, or a cabinet officer are the sort of experiences that count the most. We should avoid any candidate who thinks that government should be run like a business. The business of America is business, but the business of the president is government. At the highest level, politics, communications, policy and negotiating are strands of the same rope. The chief executive also is the convincer-in-chief.
The final criteria is knowledge of fiscal, domestic and foreign policy. The next president can’t just be full of good ideas. He or she will need to figure out how to pay for them. Paying down the deficit, or at least capping it, must be central to the party platform. The last two presidents had the luxury of running trillion-dollar deficits. The next one will not.  
The next president should have to have a vision for domestic and foreign policy. The notion that a president can set aside one or the other type of policy or de-prioritize it is false. All of the policy bucks stop at the president’s desk.
At home, in domestic policy, the first priority will be a soon-to-be ailing economy. Immigration reform should be a second priority, but one that balances compassion and security. Health care remains another key policy priority. The next president will have to take us beyond what’s left of ObamaCare. He or she could begin by studying how other advanced nations, such as Germany, achieve excellent health care at a fraction of what Americans pay. Restoring trust in all aspects of government will be a heavy burden for the next chief executive and his or her successors.
In foreign and national security affairs, the president has vast power with fewer checks and balances. The next president, among other things, will have to figure out if the United States is to remain the leader of the free world, or just the biggest dog on the block. Sadly, the next president will inherit all of the foreign and national security problems that exist today. China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran continue to march. No U.S. election can erase that problem set.  
But if we put aside the currents of social media and focus on hiring the best executive talent, our electorate can choose the best from among the many men and women who aspire to the job. There may well be another Roosevelt, Lincoln or Washington running this year. We are due for one.

0,01/27/19 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/427122-venezuelans-must-lead-in-building-an-off-ramp-for-maduro,Venezuelans must lead in building an off-ramp for Maduro,"The political crisis in Venezuela has reached a tipping point that may lead to a peaceful return to democracy or yet more violence and despair. How the United States handles the situation could spell the difference between a successful transition back to democracy, deepening autocratic rule or outright civil war.
Contrary to claims that this is a U.S.-sponsored coup, the Venezuelan National Assembly, led by opposition parties freely and fairly elected by the Venezuelan people in December 2015, has asserted its authority under the constitution to organize a transitional government and prepare for new elections.
Since 2018, both the opposition and a significant coalition of democratic governments from Latin America, North America and Europe have rejected Maduro’s re-election as president as illegitimate due to widespread fraud.
With the expiration of Maduro’s first term in office on Jan. 10, the opposition claims the office of the presidency is now vacant. In Maduro’s place, they have elevated Juan Guaidó, who as president of the democratically-elected National Assembly is next in the constitutional line of succession.
President Donald Trump
and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
quickly endorsed Guaidó’s authority, called on Maduro to refrain from any violence against peaceful protestors and urged him to step aside.
At Guaidó’s request, the U.S. announced $20 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help Venezuelans suffering from massive inflation, shortages of food and medicine and spiraling insecurity. Meanwhile, Trump declared that “all options are on the table.”
The United States and its democratic partners in Latin America and Europe are on the right track in voicing strong support for Juan Guaidó, Venezuela’s new interim president. But Nicolás Maduro, the embattled autocrat in power, is claiming Washington is fomenting a coup, justifying efforts by Maduro’s allies in China, Russia and Turkey to weigh in.
The standoff in Caracas between two presidents claiming a democratic mandate raises the tricky question of who decides the legitimacy of a country’s government. Many leading democracies are quick to criticize foreign elections when they are manipulated through fraud and repression, but they rarely if ever deny recognition to the winner, even when the election is in dispute.
However, governments of the Americas have agreed that absolute state sovereignty is bounded by the rules of the Inter-American Democratic Charter (of which Venezuela is a signatory). The charter states that all citizens have a right to representative democracy organized through free and fair elections, and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it.
Assuming Maduro, who so far retains the support of the military top command, will dig in, the Trump administration should move quickly to keep the pressure on, including by further tightening targeted sanctions on Venezuela’s most corrupt officials.
They should not, however, threaten or deploy military force. This would surely lead to the end of the democratic opposition’s ability to claim a legitimate mandate to govern Venezuela and bring the country closer to the abyss of civil war. It would also risk losing the backing of the international coalition that supports interim president Juan Guaidó.
The National Assembly should now follow up its bold move this week by adopting a comprehensive plan to repair and restructure the country’s tattered institutions. It has already adopted decrees offering amnesty to military personnel who support a return to democracy, and it has begun considering how to restructure CITGO, a key U.S.-based oil asset.
This is a good start but much more needs to be done to signal to Venezuelan nationals at home and abroad and international constituencies that they have the will and capacity to govern.
In the meantime, the international community should support Venezuelans by providing additional humanitarian assistance to frontline South American states hosting the over 3 million refugees who have fled the country, some of whom are now facing violent xenophobic attacks.
The U.S. and its allies should ramp up international pressure on money launderers and shell companies that shelter dirty Venezuelan money. They should also work together to restrict Maduro’s ability to benefit from Venezuela’s businesses, but this should be coordinated with a broader political strategy designed to end the stalemate.
In addition, the United Nations secretary general should urgently appoint a personal envoy to serve as a focal point for the multinational friends of Venezuelan democracy group now rallying behind the National Assembly and supporting U.N. Security Council action.
Building an off-ramp for the Maduro regime will be difficult. But a combination of rising costs on Maduro’s inner circle through targeted sanctions and prosecutions, reassurance to the military’s rank and file that they will benefit from a transition to democracy and positive incentives of economic assistance by entities willing to negotiate with the new interim government (such as the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank) will make legitimate democratic change, in accordance with Venezuela’s constitution, more likely.

0,01/26/19 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/427096-what-actually-happens-when-ads-are-pulled-over-political-controversy,What actually happens when ads are pulled over political controversy,"This time it’s Ben Shapiro. Last time, it was Tucker Carlson. Before that, it was Laura Ingraham. Before that, it was Sean Hannity. And so on. Conservatives in the media say something controversial, ushering in an advertiser exodus as sponsors have a moment of clarity, realizing their values “do not align.”
We’ve seen this before. The Red Scare ripped through Hollywood, painting those with communist sympathies as enemies of the state who must be silenced, and in some cases prosecuted.
Conservatives in media today are not under threat of state-sponsored prosecution, but instead are subject to ""corporate boycotts."" at the direction of groups such as Media Matters, Sleeping Giants, and MoveOn.org. 
Today, it is subdued, but the song remains the same: Americans in powerful positions attempt to control the speech of other Americans with whom they disagree.
It’s time for us to re-examine.
“Republicans buy sneakers, too” probably isn’t what Michael Jordan said, but it is true nonetheless. In fact, empirically, it’s an understatement. The last five years have given rise to the direct brand revolution with digitally minded startups disrupting every category, resulting in hundreds of so-called unicorns — privately held companies worth more than $1 billion — many of whom grew through leveraging the power of conservative media outlets and programs. Ironically, marketers associated with these brands are overwhelmingly liberal with no interest in political controversy.
Direct brands are data-driven, so when their analytics reveal conservative programming systematically outperforming inoffensive content, they trust the numbers. So brands like Casper, Blue Apron, ZipRecruiter or 23andMe hold their noses and continue pumping promo codes and vanity URLs into conservative podcasts, talk radio and even FOX News, thinking to themselves: “I wish I knew how to quit you, Ben Shapiro!”
In all this, there is confusion about what sponsorship actually symbolizes.
While conservative programming yields superior results, many marketers abstain from it, for fear of promoting values differing from than their own. This is not only faulty thinking. It is dangerous to democracy and a slippery slope. Sponsorship doesn’t mean you share values with talent. It says you wish to share your values with that talent’s audience. Carried to the extreme, identical values as a prerequisite for sponsorship means corporations dictate where free speech is acceptable and where it is not.
Hold on a minute. Do we really want marketers and special interest group agendas dictating what programming lives or dies? Will we pull sponsorships from sporting events because of an athlete’s behavior? What will we do when conservative activists apply likeminded pressure toward liberal talent every time they say something controversial?   
Instead of connection, we’ve chosen isolation, unaware of the poison that seeps into our echo chambers. Whether FOX News or The Daily Show, hosts with ratings will continue preaching to the choir, shunning all who dare oppose them. Political content is the modern day Western — good guys wear white hats, bad guys in black. No one bothers to consider the other side. Meanwhile, purpose-driven startups, B-Corps, and blue chips sacrifice millions of relationships with future allies, simply because they disagree with talent.
Controversial events deepen the divide. Brands receive challenging tweets, spurred by political advocacy groups, and soon head for the hills, losing the leverage they accrued through millions of dollars already spent. 
Imagine if these brands engaged with talent directly, sharing concerns, challenging positions, and giving them something to consider? If you keep writing the checks, talent will listen. If you don’t, you’re another fair-weather friend who just proves them right — in their own minds.
Let’s stop pretending there is righteousness in segregation. As Lincoln, captain of his team of rivals once said, “Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?” 
What do people want today? Unity. Look at the press for examples. George W. Bush passed Michelle Obama
a cough drop at McCain’s funeral and made national headlines. Or recall the Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund, founded after the 2010 earthquake. The two former competitors turned elder statesmen — Bush 41 and Bill Clinton
— raised more than $50 million together while aiding 300,000 Haitians. Over 2 million individuals and entities stood behind this cause, led by two politicians with every conceivable difference, resulting in a storybook friendship.  
If history has taught us anything, it’s that you can love anyone. Just look at Rush Limbaugh and Elton John — the most uncanny pairing of them all. John not only performed at Rush Limbaugh’s 2010 wedding. The two remain friends today. “I’ve been sober for 24 years now, and one of the best lessons it taught me is to listen,” John said. “When it comes to people who might enrage you sometimes, respectful dialogue is the only way. ... Whether you make an impact in one year or 30 years, it doesn’t matter. You have to put your foot in the water and start the process.""
Amen.
Now is the time for marketers and business leaders to come out and say it: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will sponsor your right to say it.”
Your customers and your country seek bravery from brand leaders who are unafraid to work together with people who are different, in pursuit of a united vision toward a greater good.

No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”
The flaws of our great American democratic experiment are mortifyingly on display, despite the recently announced three-week reprieve from the government shutdown.

Volcker was motivated by a deeply held belief that the management and implementation of public policy demands heightened attention and respect. The shutdown dramatizes the need for greater recognition of the distinction Volcker makes between setting and executing public policy. 
In America, public policy is, and should be subject to debate. Such debate is fundamental to our society and built into the design of the three branches of our government.
But such debate at the policy level — no matter how vigorous — should not bleed over to interfere with the government’s ability to implement policies that have already been agreed upon and passed into law. A single policy dispute should not pose an existential threat to our government!
It is deeply troubling that a dispute about a specific public policy has resulted in the prolonged suspension of thousands of daily, essential tasks that federal public servants carry out for the American people.
The votes and tax dollars of the American people entitle them to a government that is responsive to its citizens and accountable for delivering on its promises. Yet how can government effectively respond to the needs of its citizens or deliver on its promises if it is closed for business? 
Simply put, the implementation of policy set forth by the legislative branch of government must be able to proceed. For our government to fulfill its public mandate, policy implementation needs to be considered sacrosanct — able to proceed without political interference unless such policy is changed in accordance with our democratic practices. 
A prolonged government shutdown will have long and potentially unforeseen impact on our collective future. The government’s responsibilities are numerous and touch many aspects of the lives of all Americans.
In addition to the personal toll that the shutdown has exacted on federal employees and their families, it has also created an administrative backlog and undermined the government’s ability to anticipate and respond to a range of risks for the American people.
Beyond that, the shutdown has further eroded the confidence of the American people in our governing processes and our democracy.
One of my greatest concerns over the shutdown is that it could deter talented people, especially young people, from pursuing public service. We are already facing a public workforce crisis as federal, state and local governments will see a doubling of the percent of their workforce that is eligible to retire in the next five years.
Meanwhile, only 7 percent of the federal workforce is under the age of 30 compared to nearly 25 percent in the private sector.
Our nation needs a public sector workforce with the experience, preparation and commitment to ensure government delivers with excellence. To be served by an effective government, the American people need paths of public service to seem attractive. 
I hope that current and future public servants will not be deterred from serving our country by this recent shutdown. I hope they somehow will envision a more perfect union, one in which government distinguishes matters of policy debate from the business of implementing established policy and delivers on promises made to the American people.

0,01/24/19 04:15 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/426849-venezuelas-curse-is-nearing-his-end,Venezuela's curse is nearing his end,"Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is a ticking time bomb. Venezuelans are saying no and taking to the streets in solidarity against his brutal regime. The opposition, with support from around the world, is on its way to breaking down the remains of Maduro and his circle of supporters. 
In a surprise turnaround, Venezuela’s opposition inaugurated in a new leader and “legitimate president” for the country — Juan Guaido. The 35-member Organization of American States, the United States, Canada and other countries have thrown their full support behind Guaido signaling more than a symbolic nod for new leadership in the besieged country.
The country faces acute poverty, a mass migration crisis, chronic hyperinflation, decimated health and educational services and cratering oil production. Maduro made grandiose claims to be socialist, but in reality, his regime prioritized rampant disregard for the citizenry. Venezuelans were left to suffer, and those who could, fled in the hopes of finding a better life elsewhere. 
Rebuilding public trust, institutions, infrastructure and the economy will take years but it can happen under new leadership.
Oil has been called the curse of Venezuela, but if the country is going to recover, oil and the revenues generated from it will be critical for recovery. It is not oil that has sowed the seeds of the country’s collapse and led it to this point. 
Not too long ago, Venezuela challenged the connections between oil wealth, poor governance and rampant corruption. It was once a relatively stable democracy and remained so even during the 1960s and 1970s when other Latin American countries were well on their way to becoming increasingly authoritarian.
While the collapse of oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s fueled destabilization that in turn created the opening for a hyper-socialist by the name of Hugo Chavez to become president, it was Chavez and his successor Nicolas Maduro who are responsible for the country’s meltdown — not oil. 
Warped by 14 years of Chavez followed by Maduro, the country is now in ruins due to dismal, non-existent growth rates, endemic and rampant corruption, weak public and social services and large swathes of poverty.
Health and education indicators continue to fall, while disease, malnutrition and crime climb to staggering new levels and inflation rises to over 1 million percent. Migration forecasts predict that another 10 percent or more of the population will leave, on top of the 3.5 to 4 million people who have fled since 2014 when Maduro took over.  
Pain really set in when oil’s price started to decline in 2014, dropping from $100 a barrel into the low $30s by 2017. Over the same period, production fell more than 1 million barrels, hovering below 2 million barrels per day (bpd).
Venezuela has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, with 90 percent of the country’s foreign exchange dependent on oil revenue, but Maduro has made no investment in necessary upgrades and infrastructure.
Now, foreign investors have all but disappeared from the country, in part because Venezuela has the highest political risk indicators in the oil world, and oil production is below 1 million bpd, a 70-year low. The country is deep in debt, with China and Russia being two of its largest creditors. 
Venezuela needs an overhaul of its oil resource management, and Maduro can’t do it. His corrupt leadership has been the curse that’s battered Venezuela and its people. Until now, his bargaining and payoffs to the military have kept him in power, but Guaido has offered immunity to the military; the writing is on the wall for Maduro’s demise.  
This represents the opening required for a dramatic shift in allegiances and a new era for Venezuela. Maduro has survived but the perfect storm has finally hit, and he’s in the middle of it. 
Venezuela faces a long period of rebuilding from the incredible damage Maduro has done. It’s time for him to return to his bus-driving days and cede power to a leader who can turn this country around.

Not so fast,"With an odd echo of Sally Field's ""You like me!"" speech at the Oscars, Donald Trump on Tuesday touted findings from a poll that he viewed as showing a surge of approval from Latinos. “Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trump
’s approval rating among Latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you, working hard!” he Tweeted. The president also bragged on Sunday about his support from Hispanics, tweeting,“That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.”
What’s wrong with this picture? Just about everything.
If you find it suspect that Hispanics would be warming to the most anti-Latino and anti-immigrant president in history — during the government shutdown over the wall, no less — you’re right. Trump’s reaction to this polling, as well as the poll itself, does not really reflect an accurate snapshot of Latino political views.
In his Sunday tweet, the president asserted that Hispanics “know the Border issue better than anyone.” This is a presumption without evidence, and may come as a surprise to the millions of assimilated, U.S.-born Latinos who do not live anywhere near our southern border. Although Latinos certainly care about immigration, immigration issues are not necessarily the same as border issues. The questions surrounding DACA and the Dreamers, for example, have little to do with the border.
With respect to the Marist poll cited by Trump, its findings about Hispanics are worthy of some skepticism. The poll was conducted in English, which suggests it may have excluded the 36 percent of U.S. Latinos who identify as Spanish-language dominant. It was conducted only in the contiguous U.S., meaning Puerto Rico was left out. Although Hispanics constitute 18 percent of the U.S. population, the poll used a data set that was 15 percent Hispanic.
Breaking the numbers down, the poll of 1,023 people included about 154 Latinos. Think about it: 154 people were used to draw conclusions about a demographic that the Census Bureau reports numbers 58.9 million. As the website Latino Rebels commented, “We’ve done Twitter polls with more respondents.”
There is nothing wrong with including a proportional representation of Latinos in a national poll. The problems arise when a small sampling of Latinos is used to extrapolate findings about the broader Hispanic population. In statistical terms, allowing 154 individuals to stand in for 58.9 million people results in a margin of error of eight percent — a figure outside what many pollsters would consider reliable.
For what it’s worth, the same poll showed that 58 percent of Hispanics did not plan to vote for Trump, compared to 27 percent who did. Funny how the president left this finding out of his tweets.
Controversies around Latino opinion surveys are nothing new, most notably in the 2016 presidential election when Hispanic support for Trump was hotly disputed by experts. Nate Cohn pointed out that pollsters tend to sample a disproportionately Republican group of Hispanic voters, leading to results that skew right. And it is not easy to compile accurate data about Hispanics. The Latino community is diverse and surveying it requires sophisticated methodology. That’s why there are companies and organizations like Latino Decisions and the Pew Research Center devoted to this complex task. A 2018 Pew survey on the Latino community, for instance, was bilingual and used 1,501 Hispanic adults.
True, there are Latinos who support Trump, for the same reasons that other Americans do: because they are steadfast Republicans, because they admire his business background, or because they like his policies. But they are a minority among the Latino community. The best evidence we have of this can be seen in the 2018 midterm results. An estimated 69 percent of Latinos voted for the Democratic candidate, Pew reports, compared with just 29 percent who backed a Republican candidate.
Just like a majority of other Americans, a solid majority of Latinos pushed back against Trump and his policies.
In our current political climate, it’s doubtful that Trump’s approval among Latinos is soaring. While the president can still count on support from his base, it doesn’t include most Latinos — and that is not fake news.

0,01/23/19 01:45 PM EST,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/426641-cohen-postpones-testimony-citing-threats-from-trump,"Cohen postpones testimony, citing threats from Trump","Michael Cohen, the former attorney and ""fixer"" for President Trump
who is now cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller
, is postponing his planned congressional testimony next month, citing threats from Trump.
“Due to ongoing threats against his family from President Trump and Mr. Giuliani, as recently as this weekend, as well as Mr. Cohen's continued cooperation with ongoing investigations, by advice of counsel, Mr. Cohen’s appearance will be postponed to a later date,” Cohen’s legal adviser Lanny Davis said in a statement.
“Mr. Cohen wishes to thank Chairman Cummings for allowing him to appear before the House Oversight Committee and looks forward to testifying at the appropriate time. This is a time where Mr. Cohen had to put his family and their safety first.”
Trump reacted to the news later Wednesday, asserting Cohen had been ""threatened by the truth.""
""He doesn't want to tell the truth for me or other of his clients,"" Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.
There had been high anticipation surrounding Cohen's testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee since Chairman Elijah Cummings
(D-Md.) announced it earlier in January. The move represented one of the first power plays by House Democrats as they eased into their investigative roles that came with winning the lower chamber's majority.
Cummings declined to answer questions from reporters on Cohen's decision to postpone his testimony early Wednesday afternoon.
In a statement, Cummings and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff
(D-Calif.) described Cohen's concerns as legitimate but emphasized that ""not appearing before Congress was never an option."" 
""When our Committees began discussions with Mr. Cohen’s attorney, not appearing before Congress was never an option. We will not let the President’s tactics prevent Congress from fulfilling our constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities,"" the lawmakers said. 
""This will not stop us from getting to the truth. We expect Mr. Cohen to appear before both Committees, and we remain engaged with his counsel about his upcoming appearances,"" they said. 
While Trump said earlier this month he is “not worried” about the hearing, he and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have excoriated Cohen since he began cooperating with federal investigators. Trump has labeled him a “rat” and suggested he told lies to prosecutors in order to obtain a lighter prison sentence. 
“Well, there is no information. But he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that’s the one that people want to look at,” Trump said on Fox News. 
Cohen's father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, pleaded guilty in the 1990s to tax fraud charges in connection with his New York taxi business.
Democrats later suggested the comments could amount to witness intimidation and warned the president against obstructing congressional investigations. 
Trump also said Cohen was in trouble on “loans and frauds and taxi cabs.”
“Because where does that money — that’s the money in the family. And I guess he didn’t want to talk about his father-in-law — he’s trying to get his sentence reduced. So it’s pretty sad. It’s weak and it’s very sad to watch a thing like that. I couldn’t care less,” the president said.
Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for a slew of federal charges, including campaign finance violations related to payments made during the presidential campaign to women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. 
Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about plans to build a Trump property in Moscow in connection with Mueller's sprawling investigation, agreeing to cooperate in the special counsel's inquiry into Russian interference and potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow. 
Cohen's planned testimony would have offered lawmakers from both parties an opportunity to question the president's former personal attorney on a range of subjects. However, a letter released by two Republican lawmakers on Tuesday suggested Cohen planned to severely limit his testimony and refrain from answering questions about ongoing investigations involving Trump. 
Separately, Schiff has been in discussions with Cohen's attorneys about him potentially testifying before the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors as part of the panel's revived probe into Russian interference. 
Cohen's postponement comes after a widely publicized and debated report from BuzzFeed News claiming that prosecutors have evidence Trump directed him to lie to Congress about the Moscow property plans. Mueller's office, in a rare statement, described BuzzFeed's account as ""not accurate."" 
Giuliani has also faced scrutiny in recent days for espousing conflicting statements about the property plans. Giuliani walked back a statement he made to The New York Times that Trump told him discussions about the property were ""going on from the day I announced to the day I won.""
It is unclear whether or when Cohen's testimony will be rescheduled. He is due to report to federal prison in early March. 
Democrats could also choose to subpoena Cohen to testify.

The United States in an official statement on Wednesday recognized Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela.
Maduro was sworn in for a second six-year term earlier this month, but his election was declared illegitimate by most of the international community, including the United States, the European Union and the Organization of American States.
Guaidó, as head of the opposition-led National Assembly, has been internationally recognized as the only democratically elected leader with a claim to Venezuela's presidency.
""In my condition as president of the National Assembly, invoking the articles of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ... I swear to assume formally the competencies of the national executive,"" Guaidó told a crowd of protesters in Caracas.
""In its role as the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people, the National Assembly invoked the country’s constitution to declare Nicolas Maduro illegitimate, and the office of the presidency therefore vacant. The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law,"" President Trump
said in the statement.
In response, Maduro broke off relations with the United States and gave U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country.
""We encourage other Western Hemisphere governments to recognize National Assembly President Guaido as the Interim President of Venezuela, and we will work constructively with them in support of his efforts to restore constitutional legitimacy,"" Trump added.
U.S. recognition of Guaido's claim was followed by Canada, the OAS, and a slew of Latin American countries including Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.
But Mexico and Spain, key actors in the Spanish-speaking world, withheld their support.
A senior administration official said the United States expects international actors who didn't recognize Maduro's reelection to side with Guaido.
""Consequently, the next act would be to recognize Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela,"" said the official.
International support notwithstanding, Guaido's claim is mostly rhetorical unless Maduro chooses to loosen his grip on power.
""The next 48 hours are about whether they jail Guaido, whether he ends up in an embassy, whether he is already in the States, and what Maduro does to the U.S. embassy in Caracas,"" said Michael McCarthy, an expert on Venezuela at American University.
Trump administration officials said U.S. support of Guaido includes transferring sovereign power over international transactions to his interim government -- essentially giving him control over Venezuela's foreign assets.
But it's unclear whether the U.S. government has the power to do so immediately.
""Venezuela's lawyers will try to stop this. It's going to be pretty contested,"" said McCarthy.
""How they actually seize the assets -- there's still a U.S. court system, foreign immunity. There are major hurdles before you can deposit the cash,"" he added.
Still, the United States is vowing to increase pressure on Maduro while supporting Guaido.
The Trump administration has steadily increased sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the Maduro regime, including widespread sanctions on the gold trade, a major source of foreign currency for Venezuela.
Administration officials said further economic and diplomatic actions are on the table.
""Everything is on the table, all options, but on the economic sphere, if you look at what we've done, there is still a tremendous amount of leverage in our toolbox,"" said the senior official.
""In our sanctions we've barely scratched the surface on what actions the United States can take on an economic sanctions front,"" he added.
Administration officials have not publicly discussed military action against Venezuela, but warned against violent repercussions against Guaido and the National Assembly.
""We have a host of options, we will take every single one of those options seriously,"" said the administration official.
""[The Maduro regime has] no immediate future, they will have no immediate livelihood, and they will have their days counted,"" he added.
Still, the U.S. is looking for more international allies to join Guaido's camp and will seek to provoke a reaction that further mines Maduro's legitimacy, said McCarthy.
""The White House and others are still interested in continuing to prove to the world how authoritarian the government is, so it's a process of baiting them to make these mistakes,"" said McCarthy.
""The next step is going to be a bunch of tit-for-tat stuff, and how far it goes is the question,"" he added.

0,01/23/19 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/426572-the-strange-journey-of-rudy-giuliani,The strange journey of Rudy Giuliani,"During the deep freeze on the East Coast over the weekend, Rudy Giuliani went ice skating, not in a rink, but rather slipping and sliding on whether or not Donald Trump
communicated with certain Russians about a real estate transaction up until the day he was elected president in 2016.
Giuliani managed the equivalent of attempting a rhetorical triple axel. Necks craned. Heads spun. Jaws dropped. The episode began on Sunday morning, when Giuliani told the New York Times and television news shows that candidate Trump told him that negotiations over a Moscow skyscraper continued from “the day I announced to the day I won.” If true, that means the future president was trying to cut a business deal with Russia while demanding the lifting of American sanctions on the same country. It also runs completely counter to the prevailing narrative supported by the Trump team that negotiations ended much earlier.
Then, on Monday, Giuliani skated it all back with a statement that the admissions were “hypothetical” and “not based on conversations I had with the president.” So the talk he said he had with Trump turns out not to have been a talk with Trump. Does that clear the air up? Giuliani once cleaned the streets of New York. Now he revels in muddying the facts. How did “America’s mayor” become the president’s chief confabulator?
There are two explanations. First, Giuliani seems to covet the limelight, even when it darkens his image. New Yorkers remember the worst photo opportunity ever, back in 1986, when he and former Senator Al D’Amato, posed “undercover” to show how us easy it was to buy crack cocaine. Giuliani dressed himself in a Hell’s Angels black leather vest with patches that read “Dirty Thirty” and “Filthy Few.” Slate magazine commented, “Giuliani's casual Friday trousers and gold belt buckle make him look more like a man who wants to sell homeowners insurance than a drug addict. And the post cataract surgery glasses aren’t very menacing either.”
In describing his address to the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, essayist Kevin Baker wrote in Politico magazine, “Giuliani raved and gesticulated about the podium like an Aztec priest offering up fresh beating hearts to Quetzalcoatl. He blamed President Obama for any and all racial division in the United States” then “Obama and Hillary Clinton
for virtually every attack by Islamic terrorists over the past four years.”
This comes from a Republican who broke with his own party to endorse Democrat Mario Cuomo for reelection in 1994, which brings us to the second explanation for his ravings. It is not that Giuliani has lost his bearings, as some have suggested, but rather it is just the opposite. It turns out the true north in his compass is Trump. He has cast his lot with a soulmate who has demonstrated a strategic brilliance for deflection, dissembling, and distraction. Giuliani is amplifying the dissonance.
Media punditry has cast Giuliani as Jekyll and Hyde. But it is actually more complicated than that. In the heat of the 2016 campaign, Baker wrote on the old versus new Giuliani, “It might seem like this summer has marked a sad break with that old Rudy, or proved him a sellout. But if you’ve followed Giuliani’s career, in fact it’s clear he swallowed the whole Trump persona many years ago” with “the race baiting, the law and order pose, the incessant lying used to both steal credit and avoid responsibility.”
Now Trump is reportedly unhappy with how Giuliani performed over the weekend. Time will tell whether the meandering explanations and erratic narratives by Giuliani were strategically wise or recklessly unsound. But in the Trump playbook, the only thing worse than appearing erratic is not appearing at all. Giuliani cannot live with that, nor can his client. On Monday, Giuliani expressed concern that his epitaph would read, “Rudy Giuliani: He lied for Trump.” You can certainly argue that Giuliani deserves a better epitaph. But this week, it seems that he is doing the digging.

0,01/23/19 07:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/426460-congress-may-have-untapped-new-tool-to-protect-consumers,Congress may have untapped a new tool to protect consumers,"Like a youth bestowed a newly released Harry Potter book, I devoured the House rules package for the 116th Congress.
The section establishing a temporary bipartisan committee tasked with making suggestions for modernizing Congress, “including recommendations on … technology and innovation,” was particularly eye-catching.
With such a mandate, lawmakers could leverage this committee to do something great for all Americans: Use technology to establish Congress as a leader in identifying systemic harm to consumers.

In recent years, several national scandals have caught American legislators off guard. Two of the biggest — Wells Fargo’s practice of creating fraudulent financial accounts involving what regulators dubbed a “widespread illegal practice” and myriad problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) — provide noteworthy examples of national crises that developed right under Congress' nose. 
Protecting 325 million Americans from bureaucratic blunders and corruption is a daunting challenge. However, Congress may already possess some resources that, if reconfigured, could be a big help.

Each congressional office has a staff of caseworkers charged with managing actionable requests and complaints by constituents. In my experience, these teams are very good at their jobs. I know caseworkers who regularly turn around requests for emergency passport applications within 48 hours (regular channels usually take six to eight weeks).
Congressional offices keep meticulous documentation on their cases, but they generally work independently. If caseworkers input data on their cases into a shared system, Congress would suddenly have a powerful tool for tracking trends and protecting the interests of American consumers.
With constituencies comprised of hundreds of thousands of people, legislators have their hands full simply addressing local problems. But if caseworkers collaborated, perhaps Congress could improve its national effectiveness.
While casework is usually government-related, occasionally constituents seek help with private matters or commercial complaints. In my decade on Capitol Hill, I remember a dozen or so constituent calls related to Wells Fargo accounts that were incorrectly created.
Callers didn’t seem to think Wells Fargo committed anything more than a clerical error, easily cleared up with a phone call to a high-level customer service agent. (How wrong they were.)
Surely, other offices handled similar calls. If each congressional office had logged calls from only 10 constituents about unauthorized Wells Fargo accounts, Congress would have had over 5,000 data points on record — a solid start for an inquiry.
Such a database may not have completely prevented unethical actors at Wells Fargo from inflicting harm on American consumers, but Congress may have discovered the scandal before it made newspaper headlines.
More typically, caseworkers are solving constituent problems related to Social Security benefits, Medicare billing or VA care.
The VA scandal involved VA hospital employees moving patient scheduling off-book for the purpose of making their records qualify for congressionally-mandated bonuses. These actions disrupted actual patient care and have been linked to the deaths of thousands of veterans.
It’s easy to imagine how an analysis of casework-related data could have caught this problem earlier. At the district level, a representative’s office might have dealt with several dozen calls involving veterans and abruptly canceled VA appointments, working diligently to resolve each case.
However, because casework records are typically confined to a single office and accessible only to one staffer, the wider trend of VA dysfunction would have remained obscured.
Rather than reacting to headlines after the VA scandal broke, Congress, with a shared casework database, might have already possessed firm, actionable evidence that something was wrong — potentially saving lives.
Creating such a system would be challenging, and prudential management to protect and anonymize its data would be essential.
The Congressional Research Service (CRS), sometimes referred to as “Congress’ think tank,” would be a good candidate for managing it. The same people charged with researching the effects of legislation for members of Congress could also serve as watchmen for problems that demand congressional action.
Members of the House and Senate take pride in their casework operations. These activities provide an opportunity for members of Congress to improve the lives of their constituents in tangible, specific ways, but they could be an even greater force for good.
The new Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress should use its technology mandate to explore putting the data from congressional casework operations to better use.
Two years from now, as I devour the 117th Congress’ rules package, I hope to be reading about the newly launched Congressional Casework Database for Consumer Protection.

0,01/21/19 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/426288-only-a-matter-of-time-before-the-social-media-mob-comes-for-you,Only a matter of time before the social media mob comes for you,"Not content with the bonfire of journalistic credibility that Buzzfeed set alight on Friday, much of the mainstream media have now made matters even worse. Over the weekend, they directed their politicized venom at a group of teenage boys from Covington Catholic School in Kentucky. So because of their inherent political bias, they got it very wrong once again.
As the March for Life in Washington wound down, a video surfaced online showing what appears to be a group of high school students, many clad in “MAGA” hats, confronting Nathan Phillips, a Native American activist. This set off all kinds of social justice alarm bells. The mainstream media leapt into action, condemning the students with ferocity and vindictiveness.
Journalists went on the offensive. CNN ran an article titled “Teens in Make America Great Again hats mocked a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial” then later changed the headline to “Teen in confrontation with Native American says he was trying to diffuse the situation.” Anna Merlan of Jezebel tweeted out a request for Covington Catholic School yearbooks in what appeared to be an effort to identify, and to possibly dox, the students. Former CNN host Reza Aslan posted “honest question have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kids” with a photo of one of the Covington students seen in the video.
The apparatchiks of the social justice left piled on to ensure that heads would roll. The activist gathering site Change.org published a petition demanding several changes at Covington Catholic School, including the termination of the principal. Clearly petrified by the avalanche of bad press, the administrators at Covington initially condemned the actions of their own students, some of whom were said to face expulsion. There were even reports that Covington parents have received death threats.
Unsurprisingly, this entire incident has been egregiously mischaracterized to bash the Catholic students who showed support for Donald Trump
and to protect some left wing adult protestors from accountability for acting very poorly. The mainstream media saw an opportunity to advance a narrative of “white privilege” boys disrespecting a Native American elder for no reason other than a “dislike of others.” They of course ran with it.
But that is not what really happened. You should watch the full video of the incident. The truth is that these high school students were harassed, mocked, and threatened leading up to the confrontation with Philips, who chose to get in their faces and pound his drum. Present before and after the entire exchange was a radical activist group called the Black Israelites. They yelled all kinds of phrases at the Covington students from “white people go back to Europe” to “the biggest terrorist on the face of this earth is the pale faced man” to “come any closer and you gonna catch it” to “I hope you crackers are ready” to “you have a school shooter haircut.”
There were slurs, all manners of hateful language, and all directed at the Covington students. These are teenage boys who were being menaced by a group of adult men. It was in that circumstance that Philips, clearly well aware of what was going on, decided march into the crowd of Covington students as the radical activist group of Black Israelites egged him on.
Once again, the mainstream media has utterly disgraced itself with its coverage of this incident. They could not resist the opportunity to slam a group of teenage boys who match the preconceived notions of “white privilege.” Their support for Donald Trump made them de facto guilty in the eyes of many journalists before anything was said or done. That these students were defamed, with their lives possibly forever damaged, for the transient satisfaction of reckless journalists is appalling. There is much soul searching that needs to be done in newsrooms across the country.
There is also a bigger lesson to be drawn. Social media mobs are a growing cancer on this country. Those in newsrooms have an obligation not to carelessly dramatize such malignant efforts at the cost of personal destruction. This affects all of us. It does not matter who you are, whether you are active online, care about politics, or keep to yourself. Social media mobs may come for you, for your spouse, or for your child. They engage in a ritualistic destruction of online reputations. Even a trip to the Lincoln Memorial for high school students can turn into something catastrophic.
Journalists must find it in themselves to be better than this, especially those who have the power of large online platforms. Perhaps the only way we can change the current climate is to hold accountable those who play into the rage mobs and remind the rest of us that, no matter who you are, it is only a matter of time before the online vigilantes come for you too.

One has represented her political party on Capitol Hill since 1987, 31 years; the other since 1981, 37 years. The response advocated a defense of business as usual in congress with a “bipartisan” continuing resolution, no substantive recommendations to end the crisis and a plethora of personal attacks. 
The only answer offered by these poster children was to “reopen” government “…while allowing debate over the border security to continue.” A debate ignored by the party nobility because it would interfere with their Christmas vacations at expensive resorts and weekends with the lobbyists. A debate ignored while congress took their traditional August recess to campaign and lobby for financial contributions to their employer, the party. A debate ignored by the professional politicians for decades, with a tragedy resulting in human trafficking of women and children, narcotic infestations, economic decay and domestic fatalities.
Blinded by decades of conditioning from Washington D.C. and fanatical devotion to their political parties, solutions to issues are not part of their vernacular. This is all they know, vote for another “continuing resolution.” The proverbial political speak, “bipartisan” inaction of kicking the can down the road; “bipartisan,” a fabrication of the political parties absolving responsibility or accountability for a “bipartisan” action jointly supported by both political parties.
Over the last 40 years, the “bipartisan” members of Congress, with their continuing resolutions, persist in their negligence in addressing their first duty delineated in the Constitution by failing 90 percent of the time to produce a budget by the established deadline. If your local fire showed up late to the blaze on 90 percent of calls, if your doctors rescheduled 90 percent of their operations, if your car failed to start on the first turn of the key 90 percent of the time, wouldn’t you hold someone accountable? Eventually? So why do we not only accept but support this congressional dereliction of duty?
George Washington warned us about political parties in his farewell address: “They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party … to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction…”
When did the fanatical devotion to the party fulfill the terrifying “1984” Orwellian prophecy “…they adored the party and everything connected with it... All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State… Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.""
Madison put it simply in the Federalist Papers as “…the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties.”
The result is even seen in the separation of powers, between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, a fundamental principle of the United States Constitution, which has been usurped by the orchestrated struggle for party supremacy and party conformity across the three branches of government.
Each of these statements in and of themselves is disturbing but taken together they outline a calculated control of the many by a few in the political party to impose their will on the masses and make the masses support the few. When did the transition occur that the demand for party allegiance required deserting their congressional oath of office under the constitution?
Is this not what George Washington predicted over two hundred years ago about the effects on the government by the interest of political parties over the interests of the people?
The “Democratic Response” was an unintentional censure of the professional politicians that have commandeered the government for the good of their political parties to the detriment of their constituents. These two professional politicians looked like the poster children for the reprehensible mutation of a government of the party, by the party and for the party.
Control of the government needs to be returned to all the people, not just a few anointed party aristocrats.
It is time for us to rid our government, yours and mine, of the professional politician by means of term limits and return to a ""government of the people, by the people and for the people.""

0,01/14/19 09:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/425160-dershowitz-should-mueller-report-comment-on-noncriminal-conduct,Dershowitz: Should Mueller report comment on noncriminal conduct?,"There has been much speculation in the media regarding special counsel Robert Mueller
purportedly securing evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. Revelations in some documents growing out of the federal case against Paul Manafort
suggest that he, while managing the Trump campaign, may have provided some internal polling data to Russian operatives, and thus may have colluded with them.
We do not know whether the evidence supports such a conclusion, but let us assume, for the purposes of a legal analysis, that Mueller does come up with compelling evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. A search of federal statutes makes clear that such collusion by itself would not constitute a crime. There is no statutory crime of collusion except between business competitors in the antitrust context. Collusion between a presidential campaign and a foreign power would certainly be a political sin, but it would not be a federal crime without proof of any conduct that is specifically prohibited by statute.
If the collusion took the form of someone in the Trump campaign directing Russian operatives to hack the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign, that might constitute an independent federal crime. However, the mere use by a presidential campaign of material previously hacked by the Russians would be as protected by the First Amendment as the use by the New York Times of material previously obtained by Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning, or Daniel Ellsberg.
So what would the legal responsibility of Mueller be if he concluded that members of the Trump campaign had colluded with Russian operatives without committing any federal crimes? Would it be proper for him to include evidence of such noncriminal collusion in his report? Would it be proper for him to opine on the propriety of such noncriminal collusion?
Recall the criticism directed at former FBI director James Comey
for his comments on the alleged noncriminal sins committed by Hillary Clinton
when she led the State Department. Comey said that Clinton had been “extremely careless” but that no reasonable prosecutor would pursue charges based on the evidence, and that there would be no indictment. His disclosure of her alleged political sins, and his expression that she was extremely careless, caused an outcry by Democratic loyalists and Clinton supporters. I was among those arguing that it is not the proper function of an FBI director or a prosecutor to comment on such noncriminal behavior.
All Comey should have done was to announce the decision not to indict Clinton because she had not committed any federal crimes. Why would it be different for Mueller to issue a report about the alleged noncriminal sins of the Trump campaign than it was for Comey to express opinions about the alleged noncriminal sins of Clinton? Why would it not be proper for Mueller to state any indictments and not to comment on noncriminal behavior allegedly engaged in by any members of the Trump campaign?
One difference is that Mueller is a special counsel, rather than a traditional prosecutor. The rules governing a special counsel provide for the issuing of a report to the attorney general, who may choose to make the report public. But a special counsel is still a federal prosecutor endowed with the power to indict or not indict. A special counsel is also constrained by the inherent limitations on that power applicable to all prosecutors. Do those limitations include constraints on the authority of prosecutors to disclose and opine on noncriminal behavior uncovered during their investigations?
Recall that much of the evidence Mueller has gathered was given to a grand jury behind closed doors and subject to nondisclosure rules. This one sided evidence was not subject to cross examination, exculpatory contradiction, or impeachment. That is why an indictment is not evidence of guilt. Unless there is a guilty plea, it is a charging instrument leading to a trial during which the defendant has a full opportunity to challenge the determination made by the federal grand jury of probable cause.
A report that alleges noncriminal political sins does not lead to a trial at which evidence from the other side can be presented. For that reason, it might not be the proper role of a prosecutor or a grand jury to issue a report about possible noncriminal collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. The better way to have obtained information about Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election would have been to appoint a nonpartisan expert commission, such as the one appointed following the 9/11 attacks. Such a commission would have had broad authority to investigate noncriminal activities, including collusion, and to come up with proposals to prevent future Russian intrusions into our elections.
Alternatively, the FBI counterintelligence investigation that began before Mueller was appointed could have continued. According to the New York Times, “Unlike criminal investigations, which are typically aimed at solving a crime and can result in arrests and convictions, counterintelligence inquiries are generally fact finding missions to understand what a foreign power is doing and to stop any anti-American activity.” That might not be the proper function of either special counsels or ordinary prosecutors.
The issue I am raising, which is the propriety of a special counsel report including information and opinions regarding alleged noncriminal political sins, is worthy of serious nonpartisan discussion. It goes to the proper functions of the FBI, prosecutors, special counsels, and grand juries in a democracy that subjects them to checks and balances. This important national debate should take place before Mueller concludes his report.

His harrowing experience is another example of how Cuban baseball stars have risked everything to improve their economic status and professional potential.
A recent agreement between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation, which must be approved by the United States government, opens an opportunity for Cuban players to get to Major League Baseball without endangering their lives and being exploited by opportunists. It also gives Major League Baseball better access to Cuban players, along with more predictable costs. Under the deal, the Cuban Baseball Federation will receive a percentage of each signing bonus.
If the Cuban Baseball Federation were to use this funding to improve the professional and economic conditions of its players and to refurbish its decrepit facilities, this would be a literal game changer. It would also be a great motivation for young Cuban athletes who could aspire to earn a decent living after all of their work and sacrifice. But Cuba has a history of exploiting contract workers in other industries, and the Major League Baseball deal must be scrutinized from this perspective.
The agreement envisions that Cuban players will enter the United States on temporary work visas and maintain their ties with the Cuban Baseball Federation. This means that if they are injured, or if they end their careers prematurely, they will not be able to remain in the United States and would have to return to Cuba. The Cuban government has also stated that players in the United States would be subject to Cuban income taxes. A recent government decree fixed this tax at 4 percent on their salaries.
The bulk of compensation to new players is their signing bonus, and it is unclear if Cuba would also tax that in addition to receiving a percentage of the bonus from Major League Baseball. In the worst case, Cuban players would receive only a small percentage of their income after Cuban and American taxes. There is no transparency in the terms that would ensure the new income to the Cuban Baseball Federation would be reinvested in Cuban baseball operations rather than go to the Cuban treasury as general revenue, as is the case with other contract workers.
The United States government should allow Cuban players, who enter the country on Major League Baseball contracts and temporary work visas, to obtain permanent residence status for themselves and their immediate families after one year. All Cuban players have been granted this status in the past. After these Cuban players become permanent residents, they should not be subject to Cuban income taxes on their baseball earnings.
Finally, the United States government should require transparency to ensure that the income to the Cuban Baseball Federation from the agreement is used exclusively to support Cuban baseball operations. These safeguards will ensure that the new Major League Baseball agreement will not become just another new form of exploitation.

0,01/12/19 10:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/425033-witch-hunt-or-mole-hunt-times-bombshell-blows-up-all-theories,Witch hunt or mole hunt? Times bombshell blows up all theories,"The New York Times has published another bombshell with a story that President Trump
was named as a possible national security threat in a counterintelligence operation that was launched after his inauguration.
If true, this is likely the only time in history that the FBI has investigated whether a sitting president was either a knowing or unknowing agent of a foreign power. However, the real benefit of the investigative story may not be the original suspicion, but rather how it could explain the course that both sides have taken into our current quagmire. What if there were no collusion or conspiracy but simple cognitive bias on both sides, where the actions of one seemed to confirm precisely the suspicions of the other?
There are now two possibilities. The first of those is that Trump really was some “manchurian candidate” placed in the Oval Office by Russia and controlled from afar by Vladimir Putin. Many are unlikely to ever accept any other possibility, though the New York Times story does not suggest that this counterintelligence operation found any basis for the original allegation. Indeed, the problem arose when part of the operation was made public. Such inquiries are usually completed and never disclosed. In this case, various forces led to a partial disclosure that Trump associates were investigated and that Trump himself might have been compromised.
Now to the more intriguing theory that is more consistent with known facts. We have a clear picture of what the two sides saw at the start of the Trump administration. At the FBI, investigators, including then director James Comey
, actively considered the unthinkable possibility that the president was controlled by Russia. At the White House, Trump believed that his associates and campaign had been placed under investigation by federal officials with close ties to Democratic figures. What happened next could be a lesson in cognitive bias, and it could indeed explain a lot.
At the start of the Trump administration, the FBI has a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and opposition research firm Fusion GPS, alleging a myriad of suspicious financial and personal connections between Trump and Russia. It also had an investigation into the Russia connections of Trump adviser Carter Page. There was Trump encouraging Russia to locate the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton
and some evidence of Russia internet trolling and hacking operations. There also was the curious refusal of Trump to criticize Russia, an anomaly within Republican politics.
Soon after the inauguration, Trump started to counterpunch against what he saw as a deep state conspiracy. He asked Comey if he would be loyal and to go easy on resigned national security adviser Michael Flynn. He eventually fired Comey. He lashed out on social media against the FBI. He said in an interview that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he fired Comey. He met with Russians the very next day in the Oval Office and told the diplomats, “I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That is taken of.”
No charges were ever brought against Page, who appears to have been pursuing business interests in Russia. Moreover, investigative journalist Michael Isikoff, who broke the dossier story, admitted recently, “When you actually get into the details of the Steele dossier, the specific allegations, we have not seen the evidence to support them, and, in fact, there is good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations will never be proven and are likely false.” Even the New York Times bombshell now reports that “no evidence has emerged publicly that Trump was “secretly in contact with or took direction from Russian government officials.”
However, the FBI back then did not know all of that. From the perspective of the counterintelligence operation, every one of those moves confirmed the concern that Trump may have been working for Russian interests. They understandably began an investigation into whether Trump was acting not erratically but by design to conceal his Russian influence.
Now go back to the same period after the inauguration. Trump had just won an unwinnable election against the establishment. He had expected much of the government to be hostile to his administration. He soon learned that the FBI secretly investigated some of his aides. Then the dossier story hit. The Clinton campaign first denied funding the dossier but later admitted that it funded the effort at a considerable expense, with the money hidden as legal costs by its lawyer and his firm.
From the perspective of Trump, it all fit pattern of a deep state conspiracy of Clinton operatives and establishment officials. Soon, Trump witnessed events that confirmed his suspicions. Key FBI officials like Andrew McCabe
had Democratic connections and his wife, Jill McCabe, received roughly $700,000 from a close Clinton ally and the Virginia Democratic Party in her campaign for the state legislature. Then emails surfaced, showing sentiments of clear bias against Trump from relevant figures like McCabe and lead FBI investigator Peter Strzok, including discussion of “insurance policies” against his election and resistance against his administration.
Trump also learned that the dossier was given to the FBI by the wife of Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, who worked closely with former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates
. Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Everything that Trump was seeing confirmed the theory of a conspiracy of Democratic operatives and deep state figures against his administration.
The result is two separate narratives that fed off the actions of each other. There likely was bias in the initial assumptions, with a willingness at the FBI to believe Trump would be a tool of the Russians, and a willingness by Trump to believe the FBI would be a tool of the Clintons. Every move and countermove confirmed each bias. Trump continued to denounce what he saw as a conspiracy. The FBI continued to investigate his obstructive attitude. One side saw a witch hunt where the other saw a mole hunt.
Of course, neither side can accept at this point that they may have been wrong about the other side. In economics that is called path dependence. So much has been built on the Republican and Democratic sides on these original assumptions that it is impossible to now deconstruct from those narratives. In other words, there may have been no Russian mole and no deep state conspiracy. Moreover, the motivations may not have been to obstruct either the Trump administration or the Russia investigation. Instead, this could all prove to be the greatest, most costly example of cognitive bias in history, and now no one in this story wants to admit it.

0,01/11/19 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/424906-time-to-build-the-republican-party-back-into-what-americans-deserve,Time to build the Republican Party back into what Americans deserve,"The 116th Congress has officially begun this month, bringing an end to unilateral Republican control of the legislative and executive branches of government. The federal government remains shuttered in the midst of one of the longest shutdowns in the modern era. The ongoing shutdown is the latest example of political incapacity and unwillingness to govern, made all the more shameful by the fact the shutdown began while the Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency.
We are calling for a return to governance. The gridlock on Capitol Hill, caused by a decade of increasing partisanship and a lack of willingness to debate and pass sensible legislation, has made every problem facing our nation harder to tackle. Our nation deserves better from our elected officials on both sides of the aisle. We can no longer afford to tolerate lawmakers in Congress more concerned with winning elections than governing. The American people are hoping this divided government will not continue to be a dysfunctional government and that the Democratic majority in the House will decide on a path of reasonable governance.
We, along with other Republicans, have called on the party to reject the corrosive and regressive policies of Donald Trump. We have criticized Congress and Republican institutions for largely abandoning the tenets of limited government and fiscal conservatism, which have long been the cornerstone of the party. Despite the warnings and widespread desertion of the party by lifelong conservatives, the current Republican Party has continued to abdicate its authority to President Trump
. By embracing populism, nativism, and ideological extremism, the party has set both itself and the country on a dangerous path. We believe our government suffers when either one of, or both, parties are broken and dysfunctional.
The only way that Republicans can course correct is for those in the center right to push for a better and reformed party. We believe the party can and should be improved. We believe the path to a healthy and lasting Republican Party lies in the creation of an inclusive platform, one that holds true to the legacy of limited government while addressing modern challenges reasonably and compassionately. We have unveiled nine principles capturing our vision for the future of the Republican Party.
Four of our principles are bold calls to action for both Republicans and Democrats. The majority in this country feels unheard and unrepresented by Congress and this administration. That condition is the failing of both parties to work towards solutions for the most pressing problems facing our country. Across the political spectrum, our elected officials need to commit to participating in good faith efforts to pass legislation and enact regulations that safeguard our freedom and opportunities as Americans.
Policy proposals are improved and strengthened by thoughtful debate. We are a nation of myriad views influenced by our different experiences and our cultural, religious, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. The country has always found strength in the melting pot of our citizens. We should rediscover that strength. Republicans and Democrats do not need to agree philosophically to work together on meaningful policy solutions.
Our five remaining principles outline the ideals that we believe can be foundational for a viable Republican Party. The role of government should be to safeguard our rights and ensure the United States remains the land of opportunity. We need to invest in our future as a nation, which means exercising greater fiscal responsibility and ensuring our tax dollars yield socially and economically beneficial results. The role of government cannot be one of perpetual bankroller as we try to buy our way out of every challenge. The government should enact policies that allow us the freedom to chase the American dream without institutional impediments.
The important conversations surrounding the defining characteristics of our two political parties are evolving. Just last month, the Niskanen Center released a paper on public policy in this age of ideological extremism. There is much common ground between this proposal and our nine policy principles for the Republican Party. From the midterm election results to the ongoing work to halt the slide of our aisle into chaotic populism, it is clear there is a need and an appetite for the resurgence of a center right.
The Republican Party is far afield. It will take time and determination to pull it back from the brink. We are suggesting the first few steps toward rebuilding a party that can work for a greater number of people. We hope that those of us who are unhappy with the direction can band together to push for some necessary changes to both our political culture and policy positions. To those still serving in office, we are watching, our numbers are growing, and we will continue to work toward better representation.

0,01/11/19 11:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/424894-south-korea-president-faces-toughest-opponent-yet-his-own-economy,South Korea president faces his toughest opponent yet: His own economy,"President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has achieved diplomatic success that his predecessors could only dream of. Détente has come to the Korean Peninsula. Although a permanent peace still may lie only in the distant future, a sustained reduction in tensions and risks of renewed hostilities appears possible.
However, Moon is finding the economy to be a greater challenge than his North Korean counterpart. Moon was elected two years ago. He won despite his notably dovish views on North Korea. He appealed to Koreans who believed that the gains from the Korean miracle had not been shared widely enough.
Moreover, he benefited from the embarrassing collapse of his predecessor’s conservative administration amid bizarre corruption allegations.
A man of the left, Moon tried the standard panaceas: tax hikes, higher welfare payments, greater restrictions on work and minimum wage increases. Unfortunately, these policies have not worked. According to The New York Times (NYT): “Growth has slowed, unemployment has risen and small-business owners … are complaining.”
The poor results should come as no surprise. Government micro-management rarely solves structural economic problems. And even the best-intentioned interventions — Moon officials point to increasing income disparities and quality of life deterioration — often have negative unintended consequences.
Greater outlays and taxes channel resources away from investment and development. Higher taxes reduce incentives for work and investment. Political wage hikes essentially tell companies not to hire lower-skilled, lesser-educated workers, who then find it more difficult to gain experience which would improve their skills.
The latter effect has been evident in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Explained the NYT, a 2017 poll found that 42 percent of small businesses “said they would be forced to shed employees because of the minimum wage increase.”
Europe has suffered from similar policies. Nations as disparate as France and Greece have discouraged hiring by penalizing firing. If the government makes any new employee essentially permanent, companies cannot afford to make a mistake.
The more regulations imposed on a labor market, the fewer jobs it will produce. In Germany it was the Social Democratic government, not Angela Merkel’s nominal conservative administration, which freed up that nation’s economy, sparking that nation’s long boom.
Out of desperation, Moon’s government has offered subsidies to smaller firms. Companies complain that the process is too complex and costly — no surprise. Worse, this approach reinforces a system long biased toward business — that of the larger conglomerates.
It's far better to leave companies alone to both enjoy profits and accept losses, increasing their incentive to do right. Support for workers is best delivered directly, not through corporate intermediaries, which often end up as the real beneficiaries.
Unfortunately for Moon, his interventionist program raised people’s hopes, creating even greater disappointment when it flopped. A top union official spoke of the movement’s “high expectations for this government,” but now he feared the “possibility that the government is backing out or even reversing on the intention of their policies.”
Moon’s approval rating has fallen below 50 percent, and half of his dissatisfied countrymen cite his poor economic performance.
Alas, the situation is not likely to improve soon. The wage minimum is set to increase yet again this year. America’s trade war and China’s slowing economy have made Moon’s job even tougher. Heavily dependent on international commerce, the ROK has been suffering from global economic trends.
Moon is desperate to jump-start the economy. In a New Year’s address, he defended what he termed a “people-centered economy policy.” But he simultaneously emphasized innovation as necessary to “make it possible to transform the fast-follower model economy into a pace-setting economy and to create an economy that leads new markets by generating added value.”
How to do so, however? Generally, the kind of policies Moon has been advocating do not yield transformative economic growth. Politicians simply can’t order technological innovation to occur.
Moon’s travails also could undermine peace prospects on the Korean Peninsula. At the moment, negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea over denuclearization have stalled; President Donald Trump
appears to have unrealistic expectations about the likelihood and speed of a North Korean turnover of its nukes.
Only inter-Korean cooperation is going well. However, if Moon’s administration ends in economic failure, he is likely to be succeeded by a more hawkish, less welcoming conservative administration. A return to the confrontational ""Bad Old Days"" would be possible.
That obviously would damage the economy. Increasing risk and fear discourage investment. Moreover, renewed inter-Korean confrontation would put upward pressure on military outlays. But economic consequences would pale in comparison to the costs of any conflict. For the ROK, the outbreak of peace would be the most important transformation of the peninsula that could occur.
A wealthier South Korea also would be better for its neighbors and the U.S. Moreover, an economically successful Moon is more likely to achieve reconciliation with Kim Jong Un, who, in contrast to his father and grandfather, just might desire the same.
That would also be to America’s great benefit, especially given Washington’s role in guaranteeing the ROK’s security. Americans should wish Moon well as he seeks to fix his nation’s economy.

Playing fast and loose with the facts has long been a hallmark of politicians, so why be concerned with the dubious logic flowing from Washington these days?
When the leader of the free world cannot be trusted as an authoritative source of information on critically important topics, the world, already a dangerous place where bad things can and do happen, becomes riskier. Consider what would happen if a pandemic, financial crisis, natural disaster, nuclear accident, cyberattack, or military conflict occurred. Economists study the likelihood and impacts of these consequential but low probability events, known as tail risks. Although they are unlikely, it is usually catastrophic when one of these extreme events strikes a nation.
A new form of risk, known as “tale” risk, is whether government officials are telling the truth. It is taking hold at a time when the potential severity of actual tail risks is growing. From a supply and demand perspective, there should not be much demand for lies, although voters in this era seem to tolerate and perhaps even demand some. For that reason, there always seems to be an ample supply of lies in the political realm. But it would appear that Americans are now experiencing a large surplus in falsehoods that are being stated to amplify fear and manipulate facts.
So how do we as a nation prepare for future tail risk events in the current context? How will we respond the next time that public officials tell us that we are in the midst of one of these unlikely but serious and dangerous events? Will citizens have any faith in the government when there is a deadly infectious disease spreading across the country like wildfire, but vaccines are being rationed and distributed as the government sees fit?
Will taxpayers stand for more Wall Street bailouts during the next financial crisis, particularly as some regulatory safeguards have been relaxed? What about a major cyberattack with the potential to disrupt, if not shut down, whole sectors of the economy? Would we listen to government directives and trust public officials to get us through it? Rallying the public for military conflict presently seems almost inconceivable. Consider all this before even thinking about the potential impact of climate change.
While there is no one solution to rebuild trust in government overnight, elected leaders and public officials need to redouble efforts to prepare for tail risk events. They must explore new paths to engage citizens in ways that embrace science, technology, innovation, and inclusion, which are essential ingredients for tail risk preparedness and tale risk avoidance.
The United States continues to remain the world leader in discovery and innovation. Notwithstanding the budget proposals to slash spending for science programs, public funding remains strong, while universities and other research institutions continue to supply the talent and insights needed to combat tail risks. Technology advances not only help identify and predict tail risks, but also enable the government to respond and engage with citizens in ways that leverage data and electronic resources to generate information and services needed when bad things happen.
Science and technology combine to foster innovation that can lead not only to rebuilding institutional trust but also to establishing new forms of trust. Modern data platforms and the intelligent machines they feed, along with democratizing forms of technology, such as crowdsourcing and blockchain, suggest a future better able to predict and respond to both tail risks and tale risks. The need to ensure equity is imperative.
Whether fortifying infrastructure or preparing for the next pandemic, the government must identify ways to care for all of its citizens regardless of socioeconomic status. Citizens must have trust and confidence that the government is inclusive when it matters most. Studying tail risks nearly always focuses on assessing downside risk. No one really worries about future outcomes that may turn out to be much better than expected.
As things stand in this era, however, the prospects for such unexpected positive outcomes are diminishing as downside risks continue to expand. We need to take every opportunity to embrace truth based on evidence and strengthen our ability to respond effectively to emergencies. If not, our nation may discover that the price of tall tales is so high it drives a societal bankruptcy tail risk from which it may be impossible to recover.

Throughout the West, not just particular parties but entire party systems are losing their relevance. By ""party systems"" I mean parties arranged in a competitive equilibrium along a left-right, worker-capitalist ideological axis.
Having dominated the 20th century and presided over enormous social and economic change, these systems are suddenly disintegrating around us.
Well-prepared, experienced leaders are unable to mobilize voters. Established parties — even entire countries — are falling into the hands of charismatics and extremists. Where is this all going?
To quote both Niels Bohr and Yogi Berra: Predicting is hard, especially about the future. But as I argue in an article just published in the Journal of Democracy, we can open an analytical window into the future by examining the experience of Bolivia.
Bolivia? Yes, Bolivia. Precisely because it’s one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, Bolivia’s politics were never as institutionalized nor its parties as strong as those of richer countries.
But it has suffered many of the same economic shocks, technological disruptions and social and environmental changes as far more developed countries.
Which is why the disintegration of its politics began earlier and proceeded faster than elsewhere. Adjusting for context, Bolivia offers insights into how political disintegration works and clues about where it may be going.
During the second half of the 20th century, Bolivia’s political party system was a surprisingly robust component of a famously fragile democracy. Why, early in the 21st century, did it suddenly collapse, to be replaced by Evo Morales and his ethno-populist Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS)? First, consider the old system.
Bolivia’s many coups notwithstanding, from 1953 onward, its politics was characterized by parties arrayed along a left-right, labor/peasant-vs.-business/capital axis typical of the 20th century, which was remarkably stable.
So dominant was this system that the same parties and individuals survived civil disturbances, guerrilla insurgency, hyperinflation, economic meltdown, striking social change and many coups, returning repeatedly to take up the reins of power. Why did politics suddenly collapse in 2003?
Here the conventional wisdom is mistaken. It is simply not credible that a dispute over a gas pipeline to Chile, the old enemy, killed off not just a president and his government but Bolivia’s political parties, party system and the dominant axis of political competition.
All of these had survived far worse. Others blamed poor economic performance, but that is not credible either. The economy had grown continuously since 1986. A system that survived hyperinflation in the 1980s was not toppled by 2.7 percent growth.
The collapse of Bolivia’s politics was caused by something far deeper and longer in the making. It was a political earthquake that replaced the primary axis of political competition with a new axis better matched to its real, major social cleavage.
Political competition over workers vs. capitalists never made sense in a poor country that lacked both. Competing over cultural and ethnic identity made much more sense in a society riven by both.
Lessons for the West
What lessons does the Bolivian experience hold for the West? First, political party systems, even obviously successful ones, fall apart once they lose their moorings in the issues voters care about most. Stories of political collapse tend to be told in terms of wars and economic crises. These are not essential.
Politics can and do collapse in peacetime when the economy is boring. What is essential is the link between parties and social cleavage. Where it is missing, parties are doomed.
Second, the old worker-capitalist divide of Western politics is increasingly obsolete. As manufacturing and heavy industry decline, they take with them a class of workers who strongly identify with each other against a common enemy.
The changing nature of work, from a full-time, long-term commitment between employers and workers, to flexible ""gigs"" with few benefits or guarantees, plus increasing levels of informality, is further undermining left-right politics.
Throughout Europe, parties founded to represent industrial workers cannot hope to win elections, or even retain a purpose, while “workers-as-workers” disappear. This is why the current turmoil in France’s Socialists, U.K.'s Labour, Germany's Social Democrats and the Netherlands' Labor is not circumstantial, but existential.
Third, Bolivia illustrates how hard parties find it to change their core values and positions because they have invested so much in building reputations based on them. Both politicians and activists oppose large shifts.
As society changes, parties tend to get left behind. Political-system change tends to take the form of replacement: New parties and movements arise and push aside established parties that are no longer relevant.
Fourth, in which underlying cleavage will a new politics anchor itself? Although difficult to predict, the most compelling narratives today, in the West as in Bolivia, revolve around race, ethnicity and place.
Such a new politics will play out differently in different countries depending on their histories and on how identity interacts with geography. In countries where no group is dominant, party systems may gel around identity per se.
But where one group dominates, a new axis may emerge linking this group’s party at one end with a cosmopolitan party that denies, or seeks to minimize, identity differences at the other. We see this in Europe and the U.S. now, as well as in Bolivia.
In historical terms, this is an extraordinary reversal. The Enlightenment believed in the equality of mankind. Liberalism — in the classic sense of the word — sought to overcome identity-based cleavages.
In countries like the U.S. and France, liberals built not just politics, but national identities based on shared ideals, not skin color or cultural traditions.
Parties arrayed on a left-vs-right axis were accessible to everyone, regardless of identity. The danger now for the West is that a new politics is forged around race, religion, ethnicity and language. This could mark the end of the liberal project.
Fifth, any new politics of identity is bound to be far more exclusive, built on categories only some can access. This would represent a danger not just for certain countries but for democracy as an ideal. The reason is that the political compromises necessary to make democracy work are easier to find in economic space.
Technological and organizational change have a habit of increasing the size of the economic pie, facilitating positive-sum policy options that are mutually beneficial. For example, 19th-century revolutionary pressures faced by many Western countries were allayed by education, health and welfare reforms.
These hugely improved workers’ lives, but at the same time made them, and hence firms, more productive. Workers benefited and capitalists did too.
Mutually beneficial compromises are harder to find in identity politics. Divisions are more rigid, and rewards more often positional, measured in terms of status. As a result, such contests tend to be zero-sum: For me to win, you must lose. Positive-sum games are fewer, and the risk of conflict greater.
The demise of left-right politics, and the rise of identity clashes threatens to alienate us from each other even as it removes the means for finding agreement. It is a sad and dangerous turn for the West that may forever change who we are.

0,01/10/19 01:30 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/424719-shutdown-showdown-or-shakedown,"Shutdown, showdown or shakedown?","In Lewis Carrol’s satirical fantasy Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, a wandering Alice meets a variety of anthropomorphic creatures including the Cheshire Cat, and asks him, “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?” The Cat blithely replies, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.” That is an apt analogy for the choices America now faces, and the current partial government shutdown is a clear sign of our confusion, lack of leadership and frustration — we are lost, and we are desperately seeking a new direction.
Like in Alice’s dilemma, our Republic has come to a crossroads, and the view down each path isn’t pretty. This current impasse is not simply a matter of political differences over the building of a wall and immigration policy . . . It clearly reflects the dysfunction in today’s politics, a lack of statesmanship on both sides of the aisle and historic polarization that is paralyzing this country.
The spectacle of a president delivering a somber message to the nation from the Oval Office isn’t a new phenomenon. Many presidents have communicated issues of great importance to the nation, including Dwight Eisenhower’s message when he sent troops into Little Rock to desegregate the schools, John F. Kennedy on the Cuban Missile Crisis, Ronald Reagan after the Challenger tragedy and George W. Bush following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
But this was different, and this shutdown and the president’s recent televised address were different, as well.
It was a partisan sales pitch from the world’s greatest bully pulpit, delivered by a democratically elected world leader who is both supported and opposed by legislators who have successfully split America into angry camps.
There is no question immigration is an important topic. Though we are a nation of immigrants, we struggle with ambiguous policies and laws that are outdated, inconsistent and, though well intentioned, enforced in ways that often fail to reflect the humanitarian values we claim to hold dear. And we face a drug crisis that is spiraling out of control and lacking in clear or simple antidotes.
But while immigration and drug policy enforcement are not manufactured issues, the shutdown is. Simply a smokescreen, it is the result of the unwillingness to compromise, to forge solutions in the best interest of all Americans and a clear indication to the world that the United States — once the universal beacon of democracy, innovation and freedom — is no longer working.
How appropriate a metaphor when you consider the hundreds of thousands of Federal workers now sidelined, unable to pay their bills and struggling to make ends meet for themselves and their families. Add to that the thousands of businesses, small and large, that depend on these workers and government dollars to stay afloat. Weigh in the cost of caring for and tending to the thousands of undocumented aliens, many of them children, now in federal detention. Think about our national parks, museums and monuments, all treasures, now closed or on life support as garbage piles up and critical services are suspended. These are simply the tip of the iceberg, truly the national emergency the president has alluded to, exacerbated by stubborn, childish behavior, political self-preservation and myopic obsessiveness.
At this time in our social and political evolution, who would have thought that the “I’m taking my toys and going home” school of diplomacy would have ripened so fully?
To be fair, every president has had his agenda, his core topics and the promises he made to his constituents. And Trump, like his predecessors, has every right to pursue policies he believes are right and in keeping with the platform upon which he was elected. Any president’s greatest ally is the public, but what we are seeing now is an element of desperation and pandering unlike any I’ve ever witnessed. And the costs, beyond the human dimensions, are truly frightening.
Government should not be allowed to shut down or cease to provide critical services. Never. The message to the world is that we are broken.
Our credibility is shattered, and we need to contemplate the global consequences of this childish, entrenched behavior. Consider how this closure might embolden non-democratic countries, autocrats and despots around the world who may see it as an opportunity to say to their citizens, “See, democracy isn’t so hot — look at how badly it’s working in America.” And what about on the economic, environmental, military and humanitarian fronts? Our perceived weaknesses simply open the door for more nefarious behavior, abroad and at home.
I have a portrait of James Madison on the wall of my office. Madison, one of the architects of our Constitution, would be appalled by this shutdown and the political polarization that challenges America today. Madison and his fellow framers saw a government of checks and balances, a nation of free people who could differ, debate and resolve their troubles amicably through compromise and negotiation. They never would have foreseen a “win at all costs” mentality and this kind of political stalemate.
The “my way or nothing” approach to diplomacy and problem solving is a zero-sum game . . . nobody wins, no matter the outcome.
I’m an idealist, an optimist; I truly believe we can come to reasonable compromises that involve improved border security and the many other legitimate and important issues that face our nation. But for that to happen, our elected officials have to stop behaving like preschoolers and start acting like leaders.

The Democratic leaders have a radical policy agenda that looks more like a belated Christmas present for President Trump
than a sound political strategy. Partisan obstructionism and misguided policies will accomplish nothing of substance, since Republicans still control the Senate and the White House, but it will drive more Americans to the side of President Trump. Here are the five things you can count on from the Democrats.
Endless investigations
The Democrats will start by showering the White House with dozens of frivolous subpoenas as they pursue baseless investigations that are only designed to undermine the nationwide support of President Trump. Top Democrats in the House have already vowed to investigate “all the things” he has done that they believe goes against the Constitution. They also plan to dig even further into aspects of his personal and business life.
In fact, the Democrats had already drafted at more than 60 subpoenas targeting the Trump administration before the midterm elections last year, just as Nancy Pelosi
pledged to pursue bipartisanship in Congress. She knows that the American people are more interested in progress than politics, but she will be hard pressed in keeping her unruly caucus from shooting itself in the foot by wasting time on partisan investigations.
Socialized health care
Liberals have always been eager to support a public health care system run by the government, but until recently, the Democrats made sure to conceal their socialist impulses so as not to alienate voters at the polls. The “Medicare for All” proposal rapidly gaining traction among many prominent Democrats throws that prudent playbook out the window.
While support for this idea used to be confined to the most extreme wing of the party, many on the left have now embraced it as a possible solution to the health care crisis that they created with the ObamaCare. Yet, the American people revolted against the Democrats over ObamaCare, which was explicitly designed to avoid the most objectionable elements of socialized medicine. The new obsession with “Medicare for All” could easily make the Tea Party movement look like an afternoon tea party.
Unsecure open borders
Another radical position now very popular on the left is open borders and amnesty for illegal immigrants. The Democrats have done everything in their power to obstruct the immigration policies of President Trump, going so far as to shut the government down rather than fund the border wall and provide for effective border security. Some Democrats have even criticized the brave officials who keep our communities safe, portraying border patrol agents as monsters for simply doing their jobs. Preventing President Trump from solving the illegal immigration crisis, however, will only mean that he still has his strongest issue to campaign on for 2020.
Slower economic growth
Above all else, the Democrats know that economic underperformance often leads to negative consequences for the chief executive. They will stop at nothing to block President Trump from implementing the sort of economic policies that have already generated historic growth and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. Standing in the way of prosperity, of course, will not endear the Democrats to voters. President Trump will undoubtedly take advantage of their socialist tendencies by contrasting their defeatist economic policies with his own agenda.
More political divisions
President Trump has been living rent free in the heads of liberals ever since he first announced his candidacy. Everything about him so enrages and stuns Democrats that they simply cannot help but vent their fury in fruitless ways. The country witnessed this fever pitch in high definition when hordes of lawless activists disrupted the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh
and harassed Republican officials in public. Some Democrats have even embraced Antifa, the anarchist movement that carries out violent protests across the country, sending large gangs of masked ruffians to assault conservatives on the streets.
In the wake of another record year of prosperity under President Trump, the Democrats will be pursuing an obstructionist agenda to reverse the unprecedented progress under President Trump. Do not be surprised if he winds up thanking them for paving the way to his reelection win in 2020.

0,01/02/19 10:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/423473-trumps-just-not-that-into-kim,Trump's just not that into Kim,"Though President Donald Trump
announced in 2018 that he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""fell in love,"" Trump’s appetite for dedicating the time and energy required to develop this relationship and advance efforts to denuclearize the North is likely quite limited.
This is not to suggest that Trump and Kim are heading for a messy breakup that stokes concerns in the market and elsewhere that a military conflict in Northeast Asia is looming on the horizon. 2019 will likely be relatively calm, albeit with occasional exchanges of testy rhetoric.      
It does mean, however, that the new year will likely pass by without the U.S. making much progress in persuading Kim to give up his nuclear weapons and the development programs that support them, leaving these chronic threats firmly in place for the foreseeable future.     
Trump’s motivation to spend significant amounts of his own political capital on trying to ratchet up pressure on Kim is dampened by two main factors: his own dearth of patience and a comparative lack of focus on North Korea in the U.S. among Trump’s supporters and critics. 
The idea that Trump finds it challenging to concentrate for long periods of time on complex policy issues that require careful, discrete planning and coordination to address effectively is arguably one that even most of his allies — at least in private — would not dispute.
It is therefore not a stretch to say that the arduous process of negotiating with as wily an adversary as North Korea to tackle a task that will take years to complete — even assuming this is possible — is not a good fit for Trump’s personality or skill set.
Trump is still keen to have more high-profile summits with Kim. But he is probably far more interested in using these periodic meetings to create entertaining melodrama and show that he still has the situation under control than to resuscitate a stalled denuclearization push.
Trump’s sense of urgency and desire to put his shoulder to the wheel on North Korea are further weakened by the fact that his base appears largely uninterested in it, content to believe Trump’s narrative that he has eliminated the North Korean threat and they can now sleep well.
Moreover, neither Republicans nor Democrats said much about North Korea during campaigning for congressional midterm elections in November, and polls have shown (not surprisingly) that most voters on both the left and the right prioritized domestic issues over foreign policy.
So while many North Korea experts continue to warn that Kim is playing Trump for a fool and has no intention of abandoning his nuclear arsenal, there are few prominent voices outside D.C. think tanks and policy circles vigorously disputing Trump’s claim that he has brought Kim to heel.  
With no one about whom Trump cares or worries very much openly pushing him to go beyond what he’s already doing, and him having said he’s in no hurry to reach the denuclearization finish line (but still claiming to be moving toward it), Kim likely feels he’s in a pretty comfortable spot.
That said, North Korea still finds it frustrating and costly to circumvent U.S.-led sanctions, and it will not be easy for Kim to resist temptations to do what North Korea often does when it feels it is not getting enough attention or concessions from the U.S. or other countries — act up and out. 
On balance, however, the status quo appears to be working quite well for Kim as it provides him time and room to continue to rebuild diplomatic and economic ties with South Korea, China and many other countries, work to erode support for sanctions and quietly enhance his military capabilities.
Given this, Kim is unlikely to resume missile test launches in the near term or do something similarly inflammatory that risks prompting Trump to lash out, which could in turn trigger a new round of intense sabre rattling that derails constructive U.S.-North Korea engagement.
The risks of a breakdown in talks in 2019 between Washington and Pyongyang will rise somewhat if fallout from the Mueller investigation or another major domestic political threat boosts incentives for Trump to act tougher abroad to deflect attention away from his troubles at home. 
Looking down the road a bit farther, 2020 might prove a tricky year for both sides to navigate as Trump kicks his reelection campaign into high gear, making him more sensitive and vulnerable to accusations from detractors that his North Korea policy has failed.
If Kim calculates that Trump’s desire to keep engagement on an even keel in a critical election year makes him more open to blackmail, this would likewise put their love to the test.

has been commendably tight lipped with regard to the investigation, as distinguished from his overly talkative friend and fired FBI director James Comey
, we can only infer from public record actions, such as indictments and guilty pleas, what the report contains.
What should the legal team of President Trump
be doing in anticipation of its release? What should Justice Department officials, particularly Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, and Attorney General designate William Barr, be planning to do? What should the Democratic led House and the Republican led Senate be doing? How should the media prepare for the rollout? Most importantly, how should the American public evaluate the report and react to it?
I will try to answer these questions from the perspective of a liberal Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton
and for Democratic Senate and House candidates in the 2016 election, and who tries his best to be a neutral civil libertarian who would be making the same observations if the shoe were on the other foot, if Secretary Clinton were president and a special counsel were about to issue a report on her and her colleagues.
The legal team of President Trump should be preparing, as all good lawyers always do, for worst case scenarios. His attorneys should not engage in wishful thinking but should be brutally realistic with themselves and their client. This will no doubt be a tough and accusatory report. I have characterized it as politically devastating, as most such reports have tended to be. It also may be legally daunting, though I am aware of no compelling evidence of serious or impeachable crimes by President Trump. The fact that so many close to the Trump campaign and the Oval Office have been charged with crimes in the investigation will form an atmospheric backdrop to the nature of the special counsel report.
It must be remembered by all, especially the media, that this report, like all federal investigative reports and actions, will be one sided. It will present the evidence gathered by prosecutors and will not be subject to cross examination or rebuttal. It need not include exculpatory evidence, even if such evidence is known to prosecutors. There is no constitutional requirement that prosecutors must disclose exculpatory evidence at trial.
All of this is why the legal team of President Trump should demand, as a matter of basic fairness, that the special counsel report should not be released to the public or to Congress until his attorneys have a reasonable opportunity to study it and file a response. Then both the report and the response should be released simultaneously. Justice Department officials should be thinking about a realistic schedule for the release of these two documents, with sufficient time to prepare the response. Officials should also be ready to consider requests from each side for redactions based on national security, but there should be a presumption of openness with a burden of justification on anyone seeking redactions in the documents.
Congress should not get the report nor the rebuttal until they is released to the public. As soon as lawmakers get anything as politically explosive as these are likely to be, there will be leaks. Both houses will then have the authority to call witnesses, including Mueller and the witnesses he relied on. So the report will be the beginning, not the end, of investigations.
There will be some House Democrats who will seek to begin impeachment proceedings, regardless of the findings. There also will be some House Republicans who will just as automatically oppose impeachment. The media should, but probably will not, report fairly on the documents. If the past is prologue, we should expect diametrically opposite descriptions and analysis from pro-Trump and anti-Trump media. This is precisely why it is so important for all Americans to read these documents and decide for themselves without being unduly influenced by the partisan media.
A key consideration in evaluating the report and the rebuttal is to bear in mind the distinction between political sins and statutory crimes. It is not the proper province of prosecutors, even of a special counsel, to find wrongdoing, even grievous wrongdoing not expressly prohibited by existing statutes. That was the crucial mistake made by Comey when he announced that Clinton was “extremely careless” but not guilty in her handling of emails. Unlike Congress, which is empowered to decide what the law should be, a special counsel is limited to existing criminal law.
As we anticipate what is come as the investigation concludes, there is more at stake than the legacies of Donald Trump and Robert Mueller. The rule of law is being challenged by both sides of our extreme partisan divide. The American public is entitled to fair application of the rule of law without regard to political consequences. The president is tasked by the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. The special counsel is obliged to administer justice without regard to party or person. This new year will surely test these important principles of democracy.

It all started with the headlines about the Oval Office meeting between President Trump
, presumed House Speaker designate Nancy Pelosi
, and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer
said it all: “heated meeting,” “rowdy powwow,” “so depressing,” “WWE event.” What were supposed to be simple remarks from these leaders to the White House press pool, before a closed door meeting, quickly devolved into an acrimonious back and forth on live television, while Vice President Mike Pence
remained silent, to the delight of social media. Perhaps the comparison to the WWE event was most apt.
The Republicans who love Trump saw a forceful president standing up to out of touch liberals. The “resistance” Democrats saw their leaders maneuvering an angry president into saying that he would be “proud” to force a government shutdown. Each side had their faces and heels and, consistent with a spirit of political kayfabe, nothing actually meaningful happened, but everyone left the room with the soundbites they wanted.
For 2019, we will probably see more of this. Political observers used to think that odd numbered years were an opportunity to get things done. Lawmakers can compromise safe in the knowledge that the voters would forget about their violations of partisan orthodoxy before the next election. There is little chance that the conventional wisdom will hold. Little conventional wisdom survives in this modern era where we dig our political trenches deeper and a wilderness replaces the political center.
The Republican caucus in Congress is smaller and more rural, but much more aligned with the Trump wing of the party. While fealty to the Trump agenda plays well in their districts, they ask themselves how long they can hold out as trade wars and heated rhetoric roil the markets. Republican foreign policy hawks see whiplash, rather than winning, from a president putting faith in his gut instincts instead of his national security team.
Across the aisle, the Democratic caucus in Congress has expanded, but the party leadership needs to control divergent movements. Coming from urban areas, a new generation of legislators is ready to pull Washington to the left, emboldened by the support from their constituents for identity politics and social democracy. They must, however, contend with more moderate Democrats who won by appealing to independents and those disaffected Republicans living in highly educated and affluent suburbs.
One thing that unifies Democrats on Capitol Hill is a desire for forceful oversight of the executive branch, which the outgoing Republican majority did not provide. With the Trump companies, Trump campaign, and members of the Trump cabinet all under some form of investigation, the White House is already in a siege mentality, which signals that the president and his staff do not see 2019 through a lens of compromise.
House Democrats, in the words of Benjamin Wittes summarizing the investigations surrounding the Trump administration, are “the big new army marching on the Trump fortress.” With such a tremendous sense of besiegement, the stark logic is to shore up the Republican base and delegitimize Democratic opposition in advance of 2020. They may even pick certain fights, hoping to goad House Democrats into overreaching. That is before any thought of the prospects of an impeachment battle.
Democrats have few opportunities to enact their policy agenda, since they are boxed in by a Trump White House and Republican Senate. Furthermore, nearly any Democrat who can fog a mirror, is a natural born citizen, age 35 or older, and able to book a ticket to Iowa has sights on 2020. That means that there will be plenty of jostling to satisfy their progressive base and secure endorsements in the “invisible” primary.
In 2019, the permanent campaign and the 24 hour news cycle continue to march onward, and the American people still pay the price. Barring a transformation in the political ecosystem that changes the incentives on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the major problems this country faces will remain unresolved. Even if a badly needed rebuild of infrastructure is one area upon which the Trump administration and Democratic leaders in Congress might agree, what might encourage this kind of compromise?
We are in the midst of a technological revolution transforming everything, from what jobs we do and how we do them, to how we protect the United States. Yet, our politics narrowly focuses on special interests. After more than 17 years of war, our military is stretched as political leaders select “all of the above” as a grand strategy. Both parties have done away with any pretense of fiscal probity, so the national debt continues its stratospheric ascent, mortgaging our future and hamstringing future generations.
Given the tumult of American politics in 2018, we must consider what surprises and crises 2019 might hold. For all of its ups and downs, 2018 witnessed a robust economic growth and relative international calm. Those trends cannot be taken for granted by those in Washington in 2019. What capacity do our current politics have to provide stable leadership if the geopolitical or economic situation deteriorates? It is hard to say.
Inside the beltway, the forecast for 2019 remains cloudy with a chance of storms. If there is one silver lining in those clouds, it would be the push for grassroots political reform. Even if the political environment today is more Wrestlemania than Project Solarium, the American people can start, in their own communities and neighborhoods, to reshape our trajectory.

0,12/28/18 02:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/423039-congress-could-raise-salaries-to-close-revolving-door-to-lobbying,Congress could raise salaries to close revolving door to lobbying,"Following the midterm elections, many observers have suggested that members of Congress and their staff are overdue for a raise in one form or another. Since Congress is not one of the most beloved institutions, the issue remains fraught. Ironically, one reason why it is a suggestion worth considering is because the working class, women, and minorities remain underrepresented in Congress, often due to economic barriers to serving in government. Raising salaries would help broaden representation. Doing this would also ameliorate some of the ethics concerns that lead many Americans to hold the body in such low esteem these days. But in order to get a raise, Congress must also strengthen its ethics and transparency rules to promote the efficacy of and public faith in the legislative branch.
By the time the 116th Congress convenes, it will have gone a decade without a raise. In fact, the standard compensation for representatives, senators, and delegates of $174,000 is substantially less than the annual salary in 1992 after adjusting for inflation. Let us dispense with the obvious that $174,000 is a lot of money. Anyone who tells you otherwise has either lost perspective or never had it. Still, there are unique financial challenges for elected officials who do not come from means. In addition to maintaining two residences, some members have extra child care and living expenses among other costs exacerbated by their government service. If you have not inherited or made millions in the private sector before seeking office, these financial realities can be a bar to public service and lead many to abandon government for the private sector.
These financial realities continue to affect Congress, with high salaries that await members and staff on the other side of the revolving door posing an ongoing threat to ethics and efficiency in the legislative branch. Currently, representatives are only required to wait one year before lobbying Congress, while former senators have a two year ban. The restrictions are more limited for staff. As you might imagine, this brief window allows monied interests to entice members and senior staff with lucrative salaries both during and shortly after their tenure in government. Raising salaries in Congress would provide a solid financial incentive for members and staff to stay in public service and eschew these interests. If that raise was tied to extending the lobbying ban beyond the existing limits, it would further limit the influence of outside money on legislation.
Closing the revolving door is only one of the demands the public should make in exchange for giving Congress a raise. Some of these reforms are basic and equally long overdue. For example, members are only required to receive ethics training once whether they serve a single term or have a decades long career. Requiring members to get ethics training more often would improve compliance with the standards of conduct. The House should make its independent ethics office permanent so its authority and funding are not in constant jeopardy, and the Senate should create a similar office that accepts and reviews ethics complaints from the public.
Congress can further build the case for a raise by providing greater transparency into the legislative process. Not every constituent can see how hard most members and staff work on their behalf, but Congress shares some blame in that fact. When the Freedom of Information Act was passed to allow public access to government operations, Congress had exempted itself from the law. Many states already have sunshine laws that enable the public to receive internal records created by their legislatures. This transparency is unprecedented at the federal level but would help both to expose and to chill the influence of monied interests in politics.
Improving transparency might also illuminate how Congress could pay for higher salaries. Although we vote for a new Congress every two years, the body has largely obscured its financial decisions from public scrutiny. While the House has an inspector general, its authority and efficacy remains mostly unknown. The Senate does not appear to have a similar watchdog office. Still, many members brag about returning money to the Treasury when those resources might be better used on more staff and higher salaries for constituent services. By creating or expanding the authority for an inspector general to audit waste, Congress can ensure that taxpayer funds are not abused and identify savings to offset salary increases. Other cost saving measures might include addressing staff salaries before members or docking pay during government shutdowns.
Given public concerns about dysfunction and partisanship in Congress, on first glance it hardly seems appropriate to discuss raises, but the status quo is untenable. Without raising salaries, Congress will continue to suffer from the kind of homogeneity that fosters groupthink and unethical conduct. Pay increases for members and staff should not only shrink the revolving door to private interests but also prompt negotiations for broader reforms. Congress has been long overdue for a raise. Stronger ethics and transparency regimes can ensure Americans get their worth.

Mattis: The adult in the room — and the entire city,"There will be many reasons to miss Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis. His experience in combat, camaraderie with troops, calm in crisis management and credibility (until very recently) with President Trump
have all been huge advantages for the nation. 
He has often been called the adult in the room — when one imagines what many of the conversations in the Situation Room of the White House have been like these last two years.
But I will miss Mattis even more for being the adult in a city that risks losing its collective mind over competition with Russia and China. Some talk of a new cold war; many in the national security community seem to think war against one or both is not only possible, but likely. 
These individuals are too quick to forget the timeless words of Bernard Brodie, one of the country's top nuclear strategists, who wrote soon after World War II that until now, the purpose of the nation's military forces had been to win major wars, and now it must be to prevent them. The distinction is crucial among nuclear-armed superpowers.
Mattis has, to be sure, been as fixated as anyone on the threat posed by Russia's return and China's rise. His 2018 National Defense Strategy, which will surely be among his most important legacies, emphasizes the return to great-power competition and the priority to which the United States and allies must now accord efforts to deter these two great powers. All that is right and appropriate.
But Mattis undertook the task with a certain calm. He did not see every islet in the East China Sea or South China Sea, every unfortunate incident in eastern Europe, every Russian machination in Syria as tantamount to the opening salvo in World War III. Rather, his approach has been businesslike: firm, resolute, but non-escalatory and calm.  
For example, back in January 2017, when Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson
told the Senate that the United States must prevent China from further access to the islands it had reclaimed in the South China Sea — a proposal that sounded reasonable until you realized that it could easily lead to great-power war over uninhabited pieces of rock — Mattis followed up with wise words to the effect that the issue could be handled diplomatically. 
To be sure, he sent a few aircraft carriers to the region over the years, believing that military strength could and would aid diplomacy. But he never saw the military instrument as the principal way of solving such problems.
Mattis's successor will need to emulate this kind of nuance, patience and wisdom. We do need to reinvigorate our defenses and our resoluteness against a whole host of possible aggressions and assertions by Moscow and Beijing. 
But we are in a strong enough position, with enough military power and enough allies, that we must avoid overreacting or thinking that the world is about to collapse because China and Russia are gnawing around its edges and that there are echoes of Hitler's ambitions in President Xi and President Putin.
A month after the world has commemorated the end of World War I — a horrible war that Mattis, with his passion for history, studied and understood — we need to bear in mind the possibility that competitive great powers can produce cycles of insecurity, rivalry and provocation that lead to a war no one would have wanted. 
That kind of danger, in today's world, is at least as real as the fear that an insatiable aggressor nation could keep expanding its appetite and ambitions the way that Nazi Germany or Tojo Japan did in the 1930s and 1940s.
In other words, mutual overreaction to small crises can produce war just as easily as weakness and deterrence failure can.  
Mattis has had the wisdom to remember both world wars, and both possible paths to war — appeasement of a dangerous aggressor, on the one hand, and rivalry among great powers producing a spiraling cycle to conflict on the other. 
He has been the adult in the room, and the adult in national security circles writ large. We need a successor with the same judicious, thoughtful and wise view of history — and of today's dangerous moment.

Go too far in one direction and fiscal hawks will accuse you of wasteful spending, or rewarding poor performance with extra cash. Go too far in the other and pro-big government folks will accuse you of setting the agency up to fail, or worse, attempting to privatize it.
At the center of many of these spending struggles are conflicts over local versus centralized management of various VA-business lines. Although these struggles often occur over matters pertaining to direct healthcare services, one such struggle was recently on full display in an Office of Inspector General report issued last week, entitled Inadequate Governance of the VA Police Programs at Medical Facilities.
The report found that “VA did not have adequate and coordinated governance over its police program to ensure effective management and oversight for its approximately 4,000-strong police officer workforce at its 139 medical facilities.” The report went on to state that these governance problems stemmed from a lack of a centralized management plan or clearly designated staff at each local VHA facility to oversee the program.
The challenges highlighted in the OIG report about VA’s mismanagement of its police force are a symptom of a larger problem regarding VA and in particular VHA’s governance structure. To this end, in September 2016, the GAO criticized VHA at large for deficiencies in its organizational structure and not having any processes in place that allowed it to maneuver complex organizational structure changes.
In response to the GAO report, VA stated that it “is strongly committed to developing long-term solutions that mitigate risks to the timeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality and safety of VA’s healthcare system.”  
Similarly, in response to last week’s OIG report, VA responded that it “will continue to work with OIG and all relevant stakeholders to make improvements to security and law enforcement programs and maintain the public’s trust.”
The VA’s responses to both GAO and OIG in the above-referenced reports are not uncommon.  However, as stated by Julia Brownley
(D-Calif.) at a House Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing earlier this year, “we are tired of receiving reports . . . we are sick of inaction.”
Brownley is correct. VA leadership must step up and look at more meaningful reforms, particularly with regard to clarity around centralized leadership roles.  
Instead of simply concurring with the findings in each government watchdog report that comes out and then moving on to the next crisis du jour, VA should focus on abolishing the VISN (veterans integrated service network) structure altogether. By doing so, VA will eliminate what has become an unnecessary level of bureaucracy and allow VA to focus on centralized leadership where it is needed, such as for the Office of Security and Law Enforcement.
The VISN structure was implemented in the 1990s in response to changes in the needs and demographics of the veterans population. In theory, the VISNs allowed VA greater flexibility in regard to staffing and budgeting needs by decentralizing control of these functions and allowing VISN directors to focus solely on the needs of a specific geographic area. Instead, the VISN structure has swelled to a network of approximately 1,000 middle managers who often create more bureaucracy than efficiency.
Like many reforms, the VISN structure worked well at first, but due to the rapidly changing healthcare environment, no longer makes sense today. As was highlighted at a House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing earlier this year, both Republicans and Democrats agreed that it may be time to get rid of the outdated model.  
As summed up by Chairman Phil Roe
(R-Tenn.), VISNs “should be the fail-safe mechanism when a medical center goes off course.  Unfortunately, too many of them seem to be afflicted with a case of learned bureaucratic helplessness.”
Despite promises of reform and an additional report scheduled for July 1, 2018, VA’s promises of VISN reform have gone unfulfilled. Unfortunately, the agency’s efforts have been diverted by more pressing needs, such as how it spent money allocated for suicide prevention, implementing the Mission Act and working through high-level leadership challenges of its own.
On all levels, the VA would benefit from streamlined business practices and clearly defined roles for leadership and employees alike. By doing so, they will not only be allowed to address more nuanced issues such as those stemming from managing its police force, but broader issues such as accountability throughout the Department as well.
The last true overhaul of VHA’s management structure took place in 1995, through the implementation of then-Under Secretary for Health Kenneth Kizer’s Vision for Change. That document and the reforms implemented as a result, will be 25 years old in 2020.  Since that time, there have been many reports and many promises of change, but no substantive reform in terms of organizational structure.
As noted by Brownley, above, veterans, politicians and other stakeholders are tired of reports and inaction. Despite VA’s best efforts since that time to implement gradual reforms, a rare window of opportunity has emerged where both Democrats and Republicans are supportive of abolishing VISNs and replacing them with a more modern and efficient management structure. We should not allow that window to close.

0,12/18/18 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/421941-battle-over-north-carolina-voter-identification-law-moves-ahead,Battle over North Carolina voter identification law moves ahead,"Voter identification has been a longstanding goal for North Carolina Republicans. In 2013, just after the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, the state legislature controlled by Republicans passed a bill substantially rewriting election laws. It included a voter identification requirement that was among the strictest in the nation, accepting only a narrow set of government issued identification. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit eventually struck down the law.
Instead of enacting another bill, Republicans placed a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year. The measure simply stated that a photo identification would be required to cast a ballot in North Carolina elections but left the details up to the legislature. Voters approved the measure 55.5 percent to 44.5 percent, so the question is not if there will be voter identification in North Carolina, but rather how it will look.
The legislature convened recently to consider enabling legislation and took a much more expansive view this time. Unlike 2013, the legislature held extensive public hearings and sought information from entities such as private colleges and community colleges on requirements for issuing their student identification. Both the state House and the Senate devoted a substantial amount of committee time to vetting and amending the legislation. Another new development in the legislation was that both the House and Senate versions of the bill had Democratic cosponsors.
The bill that received final legislative approval provides that passports, drivers licenses, military and veteran identification, government employee identification, college identification, and tribal identification, as well as identification cards issued to those who do not drive can be used to vote. The law also provides that county election boards must issue a photo identification at no charge to any voter who requests one. In one of several concessions to Democrats, the bill was amended to add that the free forms of identification will be made available during early voting.
The legislation also includes procedures for someone without a photo identification to cast a provisional ballot that can later be validated with one of the accepted forms of identification. Just before final passage, the growing absentee ballot scandal in southeastern North Carolina led to a provision requiring a copy of a photo identification to accompany mailed in absentee ballots. The new voter legislation placed North Carolina among the “nonstrict” states. Two Democrats supported the bill on final passage in the House, while three Democrats voted for it in the Senate.
Senate Democrats raised concerns about the identification requirement being in effect for a possible new election in the 9th District. The initial expectation was that the law would be implemented during municipal elections next year. However, the election fraud investigation in the 9th District may result in a new election. The photo identification requirement is effective once the bill becomes law, so it follows that it would be in effect for a mandated rematch in the 9th District. The likely date for a special election would be prior to most of the implementation deadlines in the legislation. To address this issue, the state legislature included language in a separate bill to exempt a new 9th District election from the voter identification bill. The fate of that law has yet to be determined.
Governor Roy Cooper vetoed the voter identification bill, calling it a “solution in search of a problem.” Despite the constitutional amendment, voter identification continues to be a hot button issue and the Democratic base would have been highly critical of the governor if he allowed this bill to become law without a veto. Legislative leaders have indicated that they will move quickly to override the veto. The override is scheduled on the calendar this week. Republicans maintain their supermajorities until next month, so they will have no trouble obtaining the vote for an override.
This battle will soon move to the courts with an attempt to enjoin the implementation of the law until litigation is complete. In an ironic twist, the legislation that was sought for years to root out alleged voter fraud in North Carolina may be derailed by real election fraud in the state. The possibility of a special election in the 9th District may well be the hook the courts use to hang the voter identification law out to dry for a while.

0,12/17/18 02:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/421623-federal-reserve-must-not-raise-interest-rates-for-good-reasons,Federal Reserve must not raise interest rates for good reasons,"Rocky financial markets are just the latest reason the Federal Reserve should hold off on raising interest rates at its meeting this week. So far this month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index have each fallen by nearly 7 percent. All three major stock indices are flat for the year as markets have negatively reacted to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve. This pullback in the markets impacts the retirement, savings, and college accounts held by ordinary Americans. It makes them feel poorer and reduces their propensity to spend, invest, and donate.
The price of assets and its economic impact is known as the wealth effect. People feel wealthier when the value of their assets are rising and are therefore more likely to stimulate the economy through their purchases. This is a significant factor the Federal Reserve draws on when deciding whether to raise, lower, or maintain interest rates. But the diminished wealth effect is just one of several reasons why the Federal Reserve should not raise rates this week. Perhaps the biggest justification is that doing so threatens one of the best economies and labor markets in a generation.
Over the past six months, our booming economy has grown by nearly 4 percent. For the first time since 2005, annual growth is on pace to exceed 3 percent, which is about 50 percent higher than the rate under President Obama. The unemployment rate has not been this low since 1969, when men were drafted for Vietnam. Minorities enjoy the best job climate on record, and wages continue to grow at a clip.
This economy and labor market are the results of smart public policy. President Trump
and the outgoing Republican majority repealed some of the worst aspects of the Dodd Frank Act, allowing small business owners to access credit more easily. They also passed tax cuts that include a deduction of 20 percent for small business job creators. Deregulation at the executive branch level has also unleashed entrepreneurial spirits.
Rising interest rates threaten this climate because they increase the cost of starting businesses, which drives economic and labor market growth. By increasing the cost of debt, businesses are less likely to invest in new factories, product lines, or store fronts. Existing projects and the ones that move forward in this higher interest rate environment are burdened with increased debt servicing expenses that will reduce employee wages.
Rather than putting the brakes on this long overdue growth by continuing to raise interest rates, the Federal Reserve should give the economy some more room to run. The public should not mistake delaying rate hikes as a sign of a weakening economy as some pundits argue. This is the most prudent decision that can be made to prevent an artificial slowdown.
This story might be different if inflation were rising or nearing dangerous levels. Yet core inflation, the favored measure of the Federal Reserve, is below its 2 percent target and falling. Even the Consumer Price Index, which includes volatile food and fuel prices, has fallen from its summer highs with oil prices. Given that core inflation over the last six years has averaged well below 2 percent, the economy could even some withstand short bouts of inflation above 2 percent before raising interest rates.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell offered Americans hope that the central bank may hold off on raising rates when he announced last month that rates “remain just below” the neutral target, neither accelerating nor impeding growth of the economy. Other statements suggest the Federal Reserve may move to a “data dependent” strategy, shifting away from its predictable quarterly 25 basis point increases, at its meeting this week.
What most observers fail to recognize is that interest rates may actually already be at neutral considering that the Federal Reserve is offloading the $4.5 trillion balance sheet it acquired following the Great Recession. This additional monetary tightening should also be reconsidered depending on upcoming indicators. Small businesses and their employees are only now getting their turn to enjoy the low interest rates that have so far mostly benefited wealthy asset holders. The Federal Reserve should not take this away from them, especially during the week before Christmas.

0,12/16/18 10:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/421571-democrats-must-stand-up-for-israel,Democrats must stand up for Israel,"With anti-Semitic incidents on the rise across the globe and at home, it is critical that the Democratic Party, whose progressive wing has become avowedly hostile to Israel, and some of whose prominent figures have maintained ties with Louis Farrakhan, fully and unequivocally disavow anti-Semitism in all forms and recommit its support for the Jewish State.
The waning support shown by the Democrats for Israel comes at a time when anti-Semitic incidents are increasing in the United States, as dramatically illustrated by the massacre in a Pittsburgh synagogue last month. Last year in Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacists chanted “Jews will not replace us.” These are not isolated horrors in our nation. The Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic incidents in the United States rose 57 percent in 2017, along with a 258 percent increase in the number of white supremacist propaganda incidents on college campuses.
In Europe and elsewhere, the picture also is darkening. A report from the Kantor Center at Tel Aviv University found anti-Semitic feelings on the rise globally, while attacks have grown more brutal. Commentators in the United States tend to blame Donald Trump
and his supporters on the “alt right” for resurgent anti-Semitism. However, what concerns us most is the rise of anti-Semitism among progressives, including top Democrats.
The progressive left seems determined to undermine the “special relationship” between America and Israel, the only truly democratic ally the United States has in the Middle East, and also exhibits increasingly anti-Semitic tendencies. During her campaign, congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) decried the “occupation of Palestine,” which prompted the liberal Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz to refer to her as “the embodiment of the Democrats shifting away from Israel.”
Haaretz is not wrong here. Ocasio Cortez is a darling of the Democratic Socialist faction of the Democratic Party which, in a state of “jubilation,” according to Chip Gibbons of the Democratic Socialists of America, passed a resolution in support of the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement at its 2017 convention. They chanted “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” Uttering these same words, which is code language for many Jews that stands for the destruction of Israel, recently cost CNN political analyst Marc Lamont Hill his job with the network.
The Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement demands, among other things, that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories and remove its West Bank security wall. If such proposals were enacted, the survival of Israel as a free state would be imperiled. Democrats cannot stand for this.
Congresswoman-elect Ilhan Omar
(D-Minn.) has criticized the “evil doings” of Israel and has claimed that the Jewish State has “hypnotized the world.” The victory of Congresswoman-elect Rashida Tlaib
(D-Mich.) in the 13th district of her state suggests a “shifting public discourse that Palestine activists have played a role in shaping,” says Omar Baddar, deputy director of the Arab American Institute based in Washington.
This is a shift that should be lamented, not applauded. Among Democrats, opposition to Israel extends beyond the Democratic Socialists of America to mainstream officials, many of them longtime figures in the party. Earlier this year, it was revealed that seven House members, Keith Ellison
(D-Minn.), Danny Davis
(D-Ill.), Andre Carson
(D-Ind.), Gregory Meeks
(D-N.Y.), Al Green
(D-Texas), Maxine Waters
(D-Calif.), and Barbara Lee
(D-Calif.), met with Louis Farrakhan, the notoriously anti-Semitic leader of the Nation of Islam. That seven elected Democratic officials have friendly ties to Farrakhan, a man who should have no place in the party, is stunning.
Let us be clear. We are not suggesting that Ocasio Cortez, Omar, Tlaib or any of their progressive comrades are responsible for the clear rise of anti-Semitic attacks or other incidents of anti-Jewish hatred. But we live in volatile times in which the rhetoric of these Democrats, along with their policy proposals, are playing a role in making the Jewish community more vulnerable. In a study last spring on behalf of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, Schoen Survey Research found that trivializing or minimizing the uniqueness of the Holocaust materially impedes the public efforts to resist intolerance and anti-Semitism.
Ocasio Cortez recently suggested that migrants heading to the United States from Central America should be considered refugees in the same way as “Jewish families fleeing Germany” during the Holocaust. These public remarks were widely and rightly panned for its attempt at moral equivalency, but it was damaging, nonetheless. Given these kinds of sentiments on the American left, it is not surprising that much of Israel has aligned itself with the Trump administration, which it sees as its ally and protector, in stark contrast with its feelings about the current Democratic Party. This shift began during the Obama administration, which had a frosty relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and has accelerated since President Obama left office.
What a tragic transformation of the Democratic Party that, under President Truman, led America in boldly recognizing the newly created state of Israel in 1948. What a shift from the Democratic Party that we grew up in and worked in during the first four decades of our careers including, for one of us, serving as a senior political adviser to President Clinton, whose administration held a close relationship with Israel.
As a party, Democrats look toward the 2020 elections with hope for more gains in Congress and even reclaiming the White House. To have a chance of doing so, they must first reposition themselves as a reasonable center left party, instead of the increasingly reckless left wing party that they resemble today. There are numerous steps that they can take to do this. One of the simplest is to recommit, publicly and proudly, to support for Israel. This is an important step that would also put the party back on the right side of the struggle for freedom and democracy across the globe.
Democrats must again make clear to voters, and to the world, that they are a pro-Israel party. Senior Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) and Chuck Schumer
(D-N.Y.) should use their bully pulpits to reject all connections to anti-Semites like Farrakhan and, more crucially, to reject and renounce without conditions the anti-Israel agenda of the Democratic Socialists and other progressives. It is time for the Democratic Party to reclaim its proud heritage of tolerance and support for Jewish people everywhere. Renewing its commitment to Israel is the place to start.

0,12/13/18 06:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/421309-will-congress-score-headlines-or-legislative-wins-in-next-session,Will Congress score headlines or legislative wins in next session?,"The 116th Congress may be doomed before it even begins. Less than one month before the new session gavels in for the first time, members of both the House and Senate already face pressures to continue the cycle of using their legislative power to do everything they can but legislate.
In the House, a young and diverse Democratic freshman class has arrived following a successful campaign message that focused more on health care than on the president. But such policy goals highlighted on the campaign trail face substantial roadblocks. Like Republicans in past years, Democrats are facing leadership challenges and frustrations with the old guard of the party. With this new freshman class comes differing views on both the political future of the party and how to find success despite working with the  Senate and White House under Republican control.
Appreciating the challenges ahead, members will be tempted to aim for wins in the new headlines rather than on the chamber floor, especially for those with presidential ambitions. Consequently, rather than focusing on shepherding legislation through the Senate and White House, House Democrats are likely to toy with focusing their attention on their newly assumed oversight powers with the Trump administration.
Unfortunately, this potential for stalemate is not unique to one chamber. Lamenting Republican losses in the House, many members of the Senate are also abandoning any lawmaking goals in the new Congress. Instead of legislating, some Republicans have expressed intent to focus their next two years on continuing to confirm judicial nominees, an effort some have called the greatest achievement of Donald Trump
in his presidency so far.
Committee hearings and confirmations may become the routine for the next Congress, but it was not why most voters turned out at the polls in November. According to Gallup Poll, the major policy issues for voters included health care, the economy, and immigration. Pew Research found that a majority of voters were concerned that if Democrats gained power in Congress, they would fail to “strike the right balance in overseeing the Trump administration” by focusing far too heavily on investigations.
This is not to discount oversight or Senate duty to provide advice and consent. Indeed, the oversight power of Congress is one of its greatest checks against the executive branch, albeit one that has atrophied and needs reinvigoration. The Senate should aspire to fill the 140 vacancies and more in our federal courts by moving forward with confirmations. But after decades of the legislative branch willingly deferring its lawmaking powers to the administrative state in pursuit of shinier prizes, Congress has weakened itself. Members of the next Congress face a similar fate.
But perhaps there is hope. The 116th Congress will possess every tool it needs to not only strengthen its legislative capabilities, but to fulfill its oversight and confirmation goals, if it chooses to do so. One invaluable means to this end is to promote bipartisanship, the path through which legislative goals can be realized. In the realm of rules and procedures, former and possibly soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi
recently reached a deal with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to eliminate some procedural roadblocks that have stifled past bipartisan measures.
Contrary to the convenient narrative, members from across the aisle have already identified potential areas of cooperation, including infrastructure, criminal justice reform, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Bipartisanship has certainly a role to play in the oversight space as well. While overly partisan oversight could upend any legislative goodwill, as Elizabeth Hempowicz, the director of public policy at the Project On Government Oversight, pointed out, “Politically motivated oversight is not necessarily a bad thing, if there are merits there.”
This requires committee leaders to strike a balance between legitimate inquiry and political opportunism. Representative Elijah Cummings
has worked to establish this tone already, recently stating, “I am not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody is handing out candy on Halloween.” He then added, “If I have to use them, they will be used in a methodical way” with the public interest in mind. Other committee leaders should take note, or risk having the oversight role of Congress take all of the oxygen out of the room and leave little time for legislating.
The cynical story of the next Congress is what many expect from our lawmakers. Senate Republicans will rev up the confirmation mill, while House Democrats will dust off their magnifying glasses, all at the expense of getting much else done. But neither of these activities serve the main purpose here. The 116th Congress should forge a new path forward on crossing the aisle, aligning with voters, and getting back to legislating.

0,12/13/18 11:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/421047-trumps-last-chance-to-be-the-deal-maker-in-chief,Trump’s last chance to be the deal-maker in chief,"One of Donald Trump’s favorite stories to tell during the 2016 campaign was about an ice skating rink.
In 1986, the repair of Central Park’s famed Wollman Rink was years behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget. Trump said he approached New York City Mayor Ed Koch with an offer to take over the project and a promise to have the rink ready to open by the holiday season. According to Trump, he got the job done by bridging differences between unions, contractors and government officials. Trump told the American people he’d bring the same deal-making approach to the presidency and to rebuilding America’s decrepit infrastructure.
Two years in, Trump still hasn’t delivered on his promise to “build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land.” But now, with an incoming Democratic-controlled House that shares the same goal, he has one final chance to prove he can do it.
Consider New York City, where Trump was born and raised. The underground tunnel linking the City with New Jersey – which carries 820,000 passengers per day – was built before World War I. And, a promising effort to repair these tunnels was cancelled in 2009 by Trump ally and then New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. 
Parts of New York City’s water infrastructure are 150 years old.
NYC’s water system is both a testament to American ingenuity (this ancient infrastructure is still working) and an indictment of political leaders who are coasting on the investment and achievements of generations long gone.
The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gives American infrastructure a D-plus grade and suggests there is now a gap of $2 trillion between the amount America needs to repair its infrastructure in the next decade and the amount we are currently willing to spend. If we don’t fill the gap, it will cost 2.5 million jobs and cost every American family $3,400 by 2025.
Our broken down infrastructure is costing us money, and even worse, lives, as evidenced by the recent spate of fatal train derailments, bridge collapses and the calamitous Flint, Michigan, water crisis, which is probably indicative of similar problems elsewhere.
At the root of this crisis is government’s almost criminal neglect of a line item familiar to anyone who has ever run a business.
It’s called maintenance capex (short for capital expenditures for maintenance).
Maintenance capex entails the unexciting but essential investments that keep an asset in working condition, like painting a ship or replacing the conveyor belt on an assembly line. It isn’t sexy — and when a company’s finances are tight, it is one of the most tempting areas to cut because the cost of deferral does not show up immediately. That is until your ship turns into a rusting hulk or the assembly line completely breaks down. Then the bill comes due, and it is usually much more expensive than if you had just paid a little each year to maintain the asset.
In recent years, American politicians have funded lots of shiny new infrastructure — the kind you can put your name on and have a ribbon cutting in front of — while ignoring the basic upkeep that keeps the water clean and running, electricity flowing, and bridges from falling into the river. But no politician ever got to cut a ribbon for repainting a bridge.
The private sector is a critical partner in many infrastructure projects but will only fund projects where they can expect a regular income stream and a reasonable economic return.
Many infrastructure repair projects don’t meet this standard, which means government has to pay for it or build it. So a 2019 infrastructure grand bargain would require Republicans moving the Democrats’ way and agreeing to significant public investment that is actually paid for.
President Trump
has suggested he’d be open to increasing the federal gas tax, which hasn’t been raised since 1993. A one percentage point increase in the corporate income tax would generate $100 billion over 10 years. Wherever Congress finds the money, the infrastructure investment will pay off for decades to come.
If Republicans are willing to support real public investment to fix old infrastructure, then maybe Democrats can agree to a more flexible and market-based approach to building new infrastructure, including more innovative financing mechanisms — such as Build America Bonds, Private Activity Bonds and measures that enable more institutional (e.g. pension funds) investment.
Because state and local regulatory hurdles are often the primary barrier to building new infrastructure, federal infrastructure funding could be made more contingent upon localities streamlining their permitting and regulatory processes. Congress should consider reforming the budgeting process (e.g. creating a capital budget), so the economic return of infrastructure investments is considered along with the cost for budget scoring purposes. And perhaps we could update federal labor requirements for infrastructure projects, which are still largely guided by a law passed in 1931.
When there is urgency and political will to get moving on an infrastructure project, America can still do great things. Witness the project to elevate the Bayonne Bridge to create space for bigger ships. This project was completed six months ahead of schedule thanks to a commitment by federal, state and local officials to collaborate and cut through the red tape.
There is an infrastructure deal to be had here, and America needs it in the worst way. President Trump once said, “deals are my art form.” Here’s his chance to prove it — or not.

’s “Art of the Deal” business skills turned into Edvard Munch’s famous painting “The Scream,” that iconic portrayal of a man who is overwhelmed and contorted by anguish. Here are the takeaways from the mania between our Republican president and the top two Democrats in Congress at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
First, Trump learned the hard way that there is a big difference between a president with a shrewd negotiating posture and one who thinks he can just push people around. Pushing people around may work in the New York City real estate deal, but it doesn’t work when the real estate is Washington, and Nancy Pelosi
and Chuck Schumer
are in the room.
Second, Vice President Mike Pence
demonstrated for the American people what a deer in the headlights looks like when the deer is sitting frozen in place in the Oval Office.
Third, Pelosi demonstrated clearly to House Democrats why they need a heavyweight against Trump. When he blustered about currently having the votes in the House for a massive border wall, she challenged him to call the vote. When he spun, she put the brakes on him. She demonstrated that this president has not figured out how to solve an issue beyond reciting an empty campaign promise.
Fourth, Schumer served as an equally effective foil to combat the flood of obfuscations coming from the president. When Trump tried to downplay Democrats taking over the House by pointing out that Republicans had victory in the Senate, Schumer answered him very directly, “When the president brags he won North Dakota and Indiana, he is in real trouble.”
Fifth, Schumer reminded us that Trump is willing to close the federal government because Congress refuses to fund a wall that he promised would be paid for by Mexico. Remember that? The president unwittingly set up himself and Republicans to take the blame for a shutdown.
Political battles over shutdowns are won and lost by whom the public perceives is unreasonable and at fault. In 1998 and 2013, the public held House Republicans responsible. It is true that the longer shutdowns go on, the more equally blame is shared. In this case, we have a president who said, “I will be the one to shut it down.” If there is such a shutdown, expect that quote to air on cable news as frequently as “I Love Lucy.”
Sixth, Trump displayed that he is not a Teflon president but instead has thin, if orange hued, skin. When Pelosi needled Trump during the meeting, it was like she jabbed him with a serrated knife, sending the commander in chief to the behavioral equivalent of Defcon 1. The real problem here is that foreign leaders learn from this display of how to get under that skin.
Finally, the one person watching this who might have felt some shred of relief was outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly
, who knows he will no longer have to sit through many more of these chaotic meetings.

0,12/10/18 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/education/420538-teacher-candidates-werent-that-distinctive-after-all,Teacher candidates weren’t that distinctive after all ,"Leading up to last month’s elections, teachers running for office got a lot of attention. In Oklahoma, of the 19 lawmakers who voted against a teacher pay raise last spring, eight lost their primary and seven did not seek re-election, while the number of teachers in the state legislature more than doubled. In Kentucky, where teachers had risen up to fight pension reform, GOP House Majority Leader Jonathan Shell was upset in the primary by a math teacher. In hindsight, though, we can now assess the extent to which there was a larger “teacher wave” and what that portends for education in 2019.
For one thing, it appears that the “teacher wave” was oversold. It turned out that the number of teachers running for office in 2018 was actually smaller than it was in 2016. And in the states where teachers had walked off the job during the spring’s celebrated teacher strikes, there was no shift in party control of the legislature. Most teacher candidates in Arizona, Oklahoma, and West Virginia lost their bids for office, while the teachers who did win were mostly incumbents.
More significantly, despite claims that teachers were leading a “blue wave” or a “Red for Ed” crusade, an examination of strike-state teacher platforms suggests there was no distinctive “teacher agenda.” To gauge what teacher candidates were endorsing, we examined the platforms of teachers running for office in the four walkout states — Oklahoma, West Virginia, Arizona, and Kentucky. We identified major party nominees using Education Week tracking, a list from the Oklahoma Education Association, and one from the Louisville Courier-Journal, and biographies from state election websites. We identified 184 “teacher” candidates and compiled their platforms using candidate websites, local newspaper coverage, and social media pages. Only 35 percent of the candidates were Republicans, but 18 Republicans ultimately won their elections as opposed to 16 Democrats.
This exercise was revealing. First, few teachers provided a comprehensive platform. Forty-four candidates did not provide a platform online. Of the 140 who did, all called for increasing education funding. The one other education issue which summoned broad bipartisan agreement was skepticism toward school choice, with 35 of 39 candidates who mentioned school choice expressly opposing school vouchers and charter schools — including ten out of 14 Republicans. No other issue was mentioned by even half of teachers.
When teachers did take positions, they tended to reflect party norms. Despite its relevance for spending, taxes were mentioned by less than a third of teacher candidates (40 Democrats and 18 Republicans), with candidates largely split along party lines: Republicans emphasized spending existing resources more effectively; Democrats the need to raise taxes on business and the wealthy.  
About a quarter of candidates, including 30 Democrats and 10 Republicans, mentioned criminal justice reform, with broad agreement that there should be more rehabilitation and reduced sentencing. Forty-five candidates (39 Democrats and six Republicans) mentioned affordable healthcare, with Democrats generally supporting Medicaid expansion. On other issues important in these four states, ranging from gun control to roads to social issues, no more than 20 percent of teacher candidates offered a position.
Teacher candidates in the walkout states were uniformly supportive of more school spending, and the fraction that mentioned school choice was bipartisan in their opposition. Beyond that, however, it’s not all that clear that teacher candidates shared a broader agenda — either with regard to the ins and outs of education policy, or in terms of broader policy disputes. That should give pause to those who would too quickly leap to conclusions about what teacher candidates mean for politics or schools.
Teacher strikes and marches may have captured the public’s imagination, but they weren’t enough to produce teacher candidacies that disrupted partisan loyalties or politics as usual.

0,12/10/18 09:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/420433-muellers-findings-dont-matter,Mueller's findings don't matter,"In part, it’s the length of time that it’s taken that has rendered special counsel Robert Mueller
’s probe functionally irrelevant. 
I submit that the die was largely cast prior to Mueller’s appointment on May 17, 2017. Perhaps if there had been a quick investigation with prompt findings inside of a couple of months, things might be different. But nearly 19 months of speculation, breathless leaks and innuendo — true and false — have taken on lives of their own, providing time for each side to dig in.
From what I can tell, most people have come down somewhere in one of two general camps:
Camp One
President Donald Trump is best friends with Russian President Vladimir Putin. See, Trump and Putin are so cleverly diabolical that, long ago, they foresaw what nobody else did: Trump was going to get elected president in 2016. In fact, it may even have been Putin’s idea for him to run, one that was whispered into Trump’s ear on a business trip to Moscow where Trump was recorded entertaining hookers. What better way for Trump to win favor for plans to open a hotel in Russia than to become president? Sure, it seems like a contorted way for a U.S. business tycoon to curry favor in a country where bribes usually do just fine, but there’s just no accounting for some people’s methodology.
In any event, we all know Putin broke into the Democratic National Committee’s computers and provided embarrassing emails to WikiLeaks showing the true nature of Hillary Clinton
’s campaign, so that Trump would be elected president.
After the computer break-in, Trump publicly joked that he hoped Russia could find Clinton’s missing emails (the ones her associates destroyed after the emails had been subpoenaed by Congress). But Trump wasn’t actually joking; he was totally serious. Therefore, he’s responsible for Russia’s computer break-ins. For some reason, the Democrats wouldn’t let the FBI examine the computers to confirm who did it. And even though our intel agencies at the time deemed it a national security risk of the highest order, the FBI didn’t seize the Democrats’ computers to examine. But we can safely assume Putin and Trump were responsible.
Further, the whole campaign to portray Trump as an unserious candidate with zero chance of winning was actually a disinformation campaign conceived by the Trump-Putin conspiracy team, which includes retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort
, Michael Cohen, Roger Stone
, Jerome Corsi, George Papadopoulos
and many others.
We also know, in Camp One, that Putin and Trump conspired in an unlawful, treasonous way to tamper with votes.
Okay, maybe there was no actual vote-tampering, but Putin did use Facebook ads, memes and robot accounts on Twitter to hypnotize and brainwash unsuspecting voters so they would vote for Trump.
Well, maybe Putin himself didn’t do any of that, but our intel officials are pretty darn sure that people in Russia who knew Putin, or might have met Putin once, or should have known Putin, did so. Facebook and Twitter must be punished and, prior to 2020, convinced to censor material that could be beneficial to Trump or his supporters. Trump must be impeached and driven from office. He and his team of conspirators must be put in prison for the rest of their natural lives. Melania, Don Junior, Ivanka and Jared, too.
Maybe even Baron ...
Camp Two
Bad actors in our intel community and other parts of the Deep State conspired to develop “insurance policies” against Trump. They schemed to prevent him and his non-establishment team from poking into longstanding surveillance abuses and other potential crimes and constitutional violations against U.S. citizens, journalists and politicians.
They are, at once, the incompetent gang-that-can’t-shoot-straight as well as the most secretive, highly-organized Deep State operatives who ever existed.
They successfully neutralized their biggest immediate threats: Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions
. They opened investigations as a premise to keep Trump’s nose out of his own Department of Justice. Any actions President Trump
took that veered anywhere close to his own Justice Department would then be portrayed as “obstruction.”
These bad guys also worked to cover up their cover-up of the many crimes committed by the Clinton cabal — from the Clinton Foundation to Uranium One. There were payoffs to or deals with the Clintons, Andrew McCabe
, James Comey
, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills.  
Involved in the anti-Trump conspiracies are: John Brennan, James Clapper, foreign intelligence, Ukraine (Russia’s arch-enemy), and various domestic political opponents. They secretly surveilled numerous Trump associates, looking for political intel and blackmail material. They assigned intel operatives to commit sting operations, and sent them to infiltrate the Trump campaign and transition team to lure them into compromising positions. They used political opposition research and “unmaskings.” They violated the FBI’s strict “Woods Procedures” by presenting unverified material to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain warrants to wiretap Trump associates.
Part of the conspiracy includes targeting Trump’s political allies for investigation and criminal prosecution for things they did prior to their association with Trump. Or they were prosecuted for lying about crimes that didn’t occur. It’s all to send a message: If you have the audacity to support Trump, the Deep State will comb through your life and your past and destroy you, put you in prison, or at least ruin your reputation. You’ll go broke trying to defend yourself.
For all of this, the above-named conspirators belong in prison.
Maybe even Chelsea, too ...
The fact is, whatever Mueller announces isn’t likely to change many minds at this point. Instead, it will support what people already believe.
Mueller exonerates Trump of colluding with Russia? Well, we all know Mueller is a Republican. Besides, look at all the shady characters who surrounded Trump and got in trouble. That proves he’s guilty of something!
Mueller implicates Trump in Russia collusion? Well, we all know the fix was in from the start — and collusion isn’t even a crime, anyhow.
How Muller’s conclusions are received will depend upon where we already stand.
So I say, let’s get on with it. No need to wait. We’ve each already written our own version of Chapter Two.
Let the games begin.

That is no less true of the pending exit by retired Marine Corps general John Kelly
. The truth is that the average tenure of a senior White House official is 18 months to 24 months. Serving the president of the United States in the West Wing is an opportunity and an honor, but it not a career. You serve, and you go. The key is to not overstay your welcome. You need to know when it is your time to leave.
A chief of staff to the president is a combination of a lot of things. You are a gatekeeper, controlling access to the Oval Office. You are a referee, handling a staff with competing interests and opinions. You care for the president, making sure that he has a balance to his schedule and manages his public and private lives. You are a policy driver, making sure that the White House agenda stays on track. You are the manager of diverse officials. You are a liaison to Cabinet members. You are a negotiator, often times reaching out to Congress and other interests to press points for the president. You are an informal ambassador, working with other nations to keep a balance between domestic and foreign policy agendas. You are a politician, balancing an official schedule with a campaign on the trail.
Kelly has no doubt done a great job for President Trump
. He brought stability to the West Wing with a sure and steady hand, even though he was a bit handicapped by the fact that he did not come from a political background. Yet, now is the perfect time for Kelly to exit, since starting in January, we will shortly be immersed in the gearing up by all sides for the 2020 presidential election. The next chief of staff will need to be steeped in political experience in order to succeed in this role. He or she will have to balance the challenges of a divided government, as well as deal with a demanding campaign, all while working to advance a legislative agenda.
The chief of staff is the first person the president sees in the morning and the last person he sees when he leaves the Oval Office at night. The chief of staff is on duty 24/7. No one gets to the president without permission from the chief of staff. There are only a handful of people who have the “walk in” privileges that allow them access to the president as needed. The chief of staff must balance those wants and needs. Andy Card, chief of staff to George Bush, had a rule that if you want to see the president, you never will, but if you need to see the president, you always will.
To be an effective chief of staff, you must be devoted to the president. It is very difficult to balance a private life with your service to the president because you are basically living the life of the leader of the nation. Since the job is so demanding, it is not unusual for chiefs of staff to come and go in each administration. I am sure there are others in the West Wing who are being asked about their intentions. Do they plan to stay or go? I am sure some will be asked to go, as they have overstayed their welcome.
Now is the best time for President Trump build a West Wing geared toward the next election. Some officials will leave the White House and join the campaign. The next phase of this administration will require a balance between an agenda of governing, political differences, international challenges, federal investigations, and Democratic resistance. It will be the next chief of staff who must manage all of those often competing interests and make sure the train is not derailed by any one of them.
Whoever comes next as White House chief of staff for President Trump, one thing is for sure. He or she will be drinking from a fire hose from day one. This individual must have the patience of a saint, the managerial abilities of an executive, the political acumen of a party chairman, the negotiating skills of a diplomat, and a hide as thick as an elephant.

recently made an excellent move to promote the education of children in developing countries. His administration freed resources already appropriated within the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to be given to privately run schools.
This will allow for a higher population of genuinely underprivileged kids to gain an education despite their circumstances and safeguard the educational systems for the world’s most vulnerable people.
State-run school systems in crisis countries are overfilled, understaffed and unable to cater to their whole population— if the schools even exist.
As Julie Cram, USAID’s senior coordinator for U.S. International Basic Education Assistance, explains, “Developing countries [often] lack the resources and capacity to provide a quality education, especially to children in rural and hard-to-reach areas, as well as in areas affected by crisis and conflict.”
In Somalia alone, only 30 percent of school-aged children attend a school. If an entire generation of children is skipped over on being educated, they cannot be expected to be functional and productive members of society, further plunging the country into disarray. Not only is this harmful to society, but it presents a national security issue for the United States.
A similar situation to Somalia exists in Bangladesh. Within its borders sits a seaside town called Cox’s Bazar. It is home to the world’s longest beach and 700,000 Rohingya refugees who have made camp there.
The official stance of the Bangladeshi government is that these people are only visitors in the country and therefore do not qualify for public schooling.
Enter USAID Administrator Mark Green
, who outlined the vision surrounding the new policy: “Really, we're trying to provide some semblance of educational services, so that hopefully, someday, those kids are able to, God willing, return home in a meaningful, voluntary way.”
In the previous iterations of the USAID educational spending policy, state governments were getting 100 percent of the money. God only knows what these governments were doing with it.
According to the European Journal of Training and Development Studies, the corruption in Nigeria is so rampant that it is negatively affecting the entire population. Nigeria has the world’s highest percentage of children not enrolled in a school.
Despite the challenges of corrupt governments and vast numbers of unreached students, foundations and faith-based institutions are already on the ground to provide educational services that will be bolstered by USAID.
The agency cites an academic article finding, “Non-state schools already enroll nearly 14 percent of primary school-age students in low-income countries and 24 percent in lower-middle income countries. Globally, nearly one in three higher education students were enrolled in a private institution.”
USAID policy will now recognize this reality and expand funding to reach a more diverse array of institutions.
Though it may not seem like it upon first inspection, this new policy to help international educational efforts is also an ""America First"" policy.
According to the USAID, the fourth pillar of Trump’s National Security Strategy “prioritizes strengthening countries’ capacity to achieve sustainable development outcomes, a goal that depends directly on the strength of the education sector.”
By providing more access to education, we are enhancing and protecting our national security interests. Stable countries are much easier to trade and deal with and contribute significantly to the global community.
The money will go to children who are eager to learn and who yearn for the opportunity to improve themselves. Green said that, in observing a classroom in Ghana on a trip with First Lady Melania Trump
, “Those kids were absolutely desperate to be there.”
Through this initiative, hundreds of thousands of children will get an education and go on to help build up their communities and countries.
In the end, this new USAID policy will ensure that American generosity helps as many people as possible. Mr. Green and President Trump deserve pats on the back for this decision, which has the potential to improve the lives of countless families and the future of their communities.
I look forward to hearing of the good that comes out of assisting non-state schools internationally.

Do that!’ And nothing will happen. Poor Ike — it won’t be a bit like the Army. He’ll find it very frustrating.” Donald Trump ascended to the presidency with far less experience than General Eisenhower. He also took over a government that is much larger. All signs indicate that he, as Truman predicted about Eisenhower, is very surprised at the limits of his ability to control the executive branch.
In the past few weeks, there have been a number of times when executive agencies have taken actions directly contrary to the wishes of the president. Most prominently, last week the Mueller investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election produced a series of revelations that implicate those close to the president. President Trump
tweets continuously about Mueller and “witch hunts” and even appointed an acting Attorney General supposedly hostile to the investigation. Yet Mueller carries on.
Right before Thanksgiving, the Trump Administration issued the National Climate Assessment which laid bare the dangers to the United States of man-made climate change. Trump denied the conclusions of the report, a strange reaction for a president regarding a report from the executive branch of government.
Finally, while the President has gradually walked back his condemnation of Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia for his potential involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the CIA had a different response. They issued a report tying bin Salman to the murder.
Supporters of the president bemoan the “deep state,” in each of these cases. Steve Bannon
called for its deconstruction in the early days of the administration. But there is no grand conspiracy out there to buck the president or make him look foolish. It is just the government working the way it was designed over the past century.
Most importantly, agencies like the CIA and the EPA don’t just work for the president. In our system of government, they also work for the body that created them and exercises oversight over them, the U.S. Congress. Failure to follow the will of Congress on the part of agencies leads first to unpleasant hearings on Capitol Hill, and then perhaps riders on budget bills, Congressional investigations, or reduced funding for your agency. 
Executive branch agencies also have to worry about the third branch of government, the judiciary. In other words, they have to follow the law. The National Climate Assessment was written pursuant to a law passed in the early 1990s. Failure to follow the law results in embarrassment for agencies, and the wasting of valuable resources. The Trump Administration has learned this the hard way as many of their attempts at deregulation have been halted by the courts.
None of this is to say that agency officials (or the “deep state”) don’t have their own policy preferences. They do. Prosecutors like to see their targets behind bars whether they are presidential advisers or alleged drug kingpins. Those who work in environmental agencies place a value higher on environmental protection than on other consequences of economic activity.

But their preferences are a minor contributor to President Trump’s difficulty in controlling the agencies that report to him. A much bigger problem for the president are the laws written by Congress (and signed by previous presidents) that direct those agencies to behave in certain ways, and the courts charged with making sure agencies follow those laws.
President Trump is fighting the law, not the deep state, when he complains about agency actions. And, as the song tells us, when you fight the law, the law usually wins.

He admitted what he really believes. Lamenting the inability of his government to plan every aspect of real estate in New York City “to determine which building goes where, how high it will be, who gets to live in it, what the rent will be,” de Blasio identified property rights as the great obstacle to his ambitions. “What’s been hardest,” he said, “is the way our legal system is structured to favor private property.” His comments have attracted a wide range of criticism.
First of all, the mayor of New York City, the financial capital of the world, complaining about capitalism is much like the mayor of Los Angeles complaining about the entertainment industry holding his town back. If not for the centuries long embrace of private property rights in New York City, de Blasio would be mayor of an impoverished fishing village. Second, his indictment of private property seems to stop just short of trespassing his own. There is nothing stopping de Blasio from handing his multiple rental properties over to the New York City government, yet these rental properties continue to net him thousands of dollars every month.
But as out of touch and hypocritical as his statement may have been, it serves as a valuable reminder of what is really behind the current “socialist moment” within the Democratic Party. The media has made cult heroes of left wing radicals like Bernie Sanders
, who are hard at work trying to create new generation of socialist extremists by extolling the virtues of failed Texas Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke and New York representative elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. De Blasio attributes this radical energy to a “socialistic impulse” in communities of people seeking “things to be planned in accordance” to their needs.
There is an impulse, but it is not socialistic. It is tyrannical, and it is not new. This tyrannical impulse lives within all of us. The desire to set ourselves apart and write special rules for others is the dark side of human nature. It is that immutable impulse, which ever leads men and nations toward ruin, that our Founding Fathers set out to harness and neutralize with the Constitution. They knew no power on earth could turn people into angels. So they consciously devised a political system of divided government and dispersed powers, and cultivated an economic system of free market capitalism, anchored in equal individual property rights.
De Blasio is absolutely right that the great threat to his ideological goals are private property and the rule of law that protects it. What really frustrates him is that in America, everyone else enjoys the same rights he does. That is the real story about the lament of the New York City mayor, and the reason that boomlet socialism is enjoying a surge on the left.
Despite what “fake news” tells you, there is nothing populist about socialism. It has never empowered the “little guy.” In socialist systems, the little guy always ends up in bread lines or behind bars. Nor does it, as conservatives sometimes charge, mire everyone in equal misery. On the contrary, in socialist countries, the wealthy and the connected always make out like bandits. Literally. That is why, throughout history, it is always elites like de Blasio, O’Rourke, Ocasio Cortez, Elizabeth Warren
, along with their allies in academia, entertainment industry, and the mainstream media, who lead the charge to push forward this disgraced ideology.
If and when the revolution comes, they expect to be the ones calling the shots. They think they deserve to wield that power over the rest of us deplorables, bitterly clinging to the wrong side of history. Such self satisfied and power hungry elites are exactly the kind of people our Constitution set up to thwart. The frustration expressed by de Blasio is a positive outcome of that system, one we should all be eager to protect.

0,12/05/18 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/419839-how-republicans-can-win-back-suburban-vote-in-next-election,How Republicans can win back suburban vote in next election,"The defeats suffered by Republican candidates in suburban swing districts handed control of the House to Democrats for the first time since 2010. Those defeats, while largely a referendum on President Trump
, also reveal significant challenges that Republicans will continue to face in suburbia in coming elections. Republicans can take back the suburbs, and perhaps the House, if they develop specific policy solutions that address political challenges among key demographic groups, and restore the party brand with voters who care about the tone and tenor of our political discourse.
First, Republicans must develop policy solutions appealing to suburban voters. Generally speaking, suburban voters tend to be more discerning about policy than those who simply choose to mark a straight party ticket. They are the men and women who are much more likely to visit the website of each candidate to read platform statements or listen to nuanced arguments in a debate. In short, these are the voters who ask, “How are the policies you support going to affect me and my family?”
In 2020, Republicans should focus their policy platform on proposals appealing to suburban voters. A “suburban agenda” might include tackling government spending, an actual plan to address health care costs and access, reforms that both improve secondary education quality and make higher education more cost effective, and real infrastructure improvements. All of these issues resonate with suburban voters because they have tangible benefits for them and their communities.
Next, Republicans should address political challenges they face with key demographic groups. It would be repetitive to talk of how Republican voters are getting older and whiter as the rest of the voters, particularly in the suburbs, are younger and more diverse. We need to accept that fact. The real issue is what to do about it. Embracing younger and more diverse candidates would be the easiest way to bridge the gap. Republicans should recruit candidates that appeal to a wider swath of the electorate. This would include giving more support to female candidates, who are routinely sidelined by party bosses at the state and national levels.
Particular attention should be paid to state and local offices where candidates can run tailored campaigns, develop of a resume of public service and accomplishment, and use that experience as a springboard to higher office. In addition, Republican campaigns and candidates need to step out of their comfort zone and make a genuine effort to win the votes of women, minorities, and young people. Our candidates simply cannot afford to cede such a large group of voters to Democrats. Instead, we must confidently present our ideas to people from all walks of life.
When you run for Congress, you run to represent all the citizens of a district. It follows, therefore, that candidates should seek to spread our message to a wider range of voters during the campaign. We believe focusing on limited government, individual liberty, and fiscal restraint will resonate with voters across all demographics. We just have to go after them. Might it be uncomfortable at times? Perhaps. But watching our share of the voting public whittle away each election cycle is worse.
Finally, Republicans need to restore the party brand with suburban swing voters who care about the tone and tenor of our political discourse. If anyone still needs proof of this, simply look to suburban southern California. Long a stalwart Republican region, the districts that comprise what was once called “Reagan Country” turned blue in 2018. Why the switch? Did swing voters in that area suddenly become interested in the policy offerings of Democrats they had voted against for generations?
No. These suburban voters became disgusted with the conservative brand, the identity politics, the attacks against the media, the hatred of democratic institutions, and the blind following of a president who has reduced our political discourse to name calling on Twitter. These voters were the backbone of Reagan Country, and they know Republicans have wandered far off track. Restoring the brand means returning to the foundational beliefs that unite all Republicans. Voters support limited government, individual liberty, fiscal restraint, and global leadership.
Republicans must be willing to call out members of our own party, and even the president, when they are not acting in a manner consistent with Republican values or societal norms. We must be willing to call out racism and misogyny and not couch those statements in any way. We must not condone the hyperpartisan tactics that pervade our nation today.
Sometimes a loss teaches more important lessons than a win. This is the case for Republicans after the 2018 midterms. By developing specific policy solutions appealing to suburban voters, addressing political challenges among key demographic groups, and restoring the brand, Republicans can reverse the losses of this election cycle and win back suburban voters who were proud to support our party in the past.

0,12/04/18 07:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/419533-a-simple-fix-for-gerrymandering,A simple fix for gerrymandering,"It is widely believed that the partisan gerrymandering of election districts is unfair, but revising district boundaries to alleviate the problem is easier said than done.
Proposed methods for doing so involve such abstruse concepts as “efficiency gaps.” Perhaps his characterization was too harsh, but Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts probably spoke for many when he derided such approaches as “sociological gobbledygook.”
To prevent gerrymandering by politicians, the citizens of Colorado, Michigan and Missouri have just voted to have their election districts determined by experts. But this approach has not been conspicuously successful in California, which pioneered it.
There, the vote tallies for each political party diverge from their seat shares in both Congress and the state assembly as lopsidedly as in other states.
Yet, one can imagine a way to dispel the pernicious effects of gerrymandering without the need to modify any election districts. It can be described using data about the 2012 Wisconsin election for the state assembly, which was at the heart of a gerrymandering case that the Supreme Court considered this past term.
In that election, Republicans won in 60 of the 99 assembly seats even though they only got 48.6 percent of the combined votes for Republicans and Democrats. (Third-party vote totals were negligible).
Suppose that, mirroring the statewide vote split of 51.4 percent to 48.6 percent, Democrats were declared the winners in 51 of the 99 districts. These districts would consist of the 39 that they won outright plus the 12 additional districts in which they were the closest runners-up. The remaining 48 districts would be allotted to the Republicans.
This approach is simple and can be implemented quickly and unambiguously once election results are at hand. It would focus directly on the disparity between statewide and gerrymandered results that is the actual source of frustration. By definition, this “statewide match” proposal would eliminate that disparity.
As one explores the idea further, it becomes more attractive. The Wisconsin Republicans won 60.6 percent of the assembly seats in 2012. A total of 2.66 million two-party votes were cast in assembly races and, ideally, 60.6 percent of the seats would correspond to 60.6 percent of the votes, which is 1.61 million votes. 
Yet, the Republicans only amassed 1.28 million votes statewide. In effect, the Republicans were awarded 330,000 votes (1.61 million minus 1.28 million) that actually went to Democrats. Put another way, 330,000 Wisconsin voters essentially had their votes “reversed” and assigned to the other party. This would not happen under a “statewide match” proposal. 
Of course, declaring Democrats the winners in 12 Wisconsin districts where they were runners-up would also entail vote reversals. But such reversals would be relatively rare. Typical of these districts is District 50, in which the Republican candidate got 12,842 votes and the Democrat 11,945.  
Actually, to win that district, the Democrat would have needed just over half of the 24,787 votes cast, which works out to 449 additional votes. Thus, declaring the Democrat the winner in that district would be effectively to reverse 449 Republican votes and assign them to the Democrat.      
Over the 12 districts in which Wisconsin Democrats came closest to winning, the total number of such vote reversals would have been 7,711. In other words, eliminating the 330,000 statewide vote reversals tied to gerrymandering would have required 7,711 reversals at the local level.
Thus, the number of reversals would have dropped by nearly 98 percent. Calculations for other states accused of gerrymandering (e.g., Maryland, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina) yield similar outcomes, in both assembly and congressional elections. In California, reversals drop by over 97 percent compared to those arising in the districts generated by experts.
Admittedly, it seems less than ideal that “statewide match” outcome would deviate from “first past the post” results in some individual districts.
But “first past the post” is already under challenge by such approaches as ranked voting (which was recently used in San Francisco) and, as noted, there is evidence that the runners-up who get seated under “statewide match” would only slightly have fallen short. 
The approach combines simplicity, practicality and fairness. It deserves nationwide consideration.

But beyond the wins and losses are softening and strengthening party support, ideologically evolving districts and states and other factors that portend more seismic long-term electoral shifts.
With the dust finally settling on November’s elections, Democrats will have gained about 40 House seats while losing two Senate seats. These results don’t tell the whole story. First, Democrats were defending an historically high 25 Senate seats, including five that had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+9. In other words, in most years Democrats should have lost all five of those seats. Instead they successfully defended three while also winning two out of three Senate seats in Republican-leaning states.
Second, gerrymandering and other politically biased voter laws have made it difficult for either party to make inroads in certain states, with Democrats facing far steeper challenges. For example, while Democrats lost to Republicans by only two percentage points in North Carolina congressional races, they remain at a 10-3 deficit in the state’s congressional delegation.
In fact, in examining the 25 most gerrymandered states, as defined by data analytics firm Azavea, we multiplied the total number of districts in each state by the Democrats’ voting percentage in each state’s congressional races, discovering that Democrats lost a net seven House seats nationwide due to gerrymandering.
And it’s not just gerrymandering. When factoring all of the states with strict voter identification requirements, Republicans won 17 more seats than Democrats (38 to 21). The removal or relocation of polling places from highly concentrated Democratic areas also likely influenced the election results. The Republican-led purging of voter rolls in purple states like Ohio also had an impact: Republicans won 12 of 16 House seats there despite beating Democrats by only five percentage points in congressional voting.
This all begs the question: How successful were Democrats in 2018? We submit that the party’s huge vote total advantage is the bigger story of these midterms, as this metric is more indicative of the longer-term strength of a party than seats won.
Some point to the 2010 midterms as the standard-bearer for “wave” elections. A response to Barack Obama
’s first two years as president, led in part by the powerful Tea Party movement, Republicans picked up 63 House seats and six Senate seats. It was the largest seat change in 62 years and marked the most substantial midterm flip of House control since 1894. By all accounts, 2010 was one of the biggest midterm wave elections in a century or more.
And yet, 2018 was bigger.
We examined the past four midterm elections in the House of Representatives: 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018. We separated them into two groups. First, we compared voting behaviors in 2006 (a 32-seat Democratic gain) and 2010 (the Republican landslide). Second, we studied voting in 2014 (a 13-seat Republican gain) and 2018. Here’s what we found.
Much has been written in recent weeks about November’s huge turnout for both sides, with a record 59.4 million votes for Democrats and a record 50.4 million for Republicans. But looking deeper, we see that each party averaged roughly the same number of votes in districts they won: just under 165,000 Democratic votes in Democrat-won seats and just under 163,000 Republican votes in GOP-won seats. The starkest difference was in seats lost, where Democrats averaged 103,762 votes, while Republicans averaged only 75,553.
One reason for this discrepancy is that Democrats fielded more candidates in more districts than at any time in recent history. For example, in 2014 they didn’t compete in 35 general elections  — or about one in eight House races. This year they competed in all but three districts. Conversely, Republicans didn’t compete in 38 House races in 2014, ticking up to 39 in 2018.
In most cases, the party that competes in fewer places is at a competitive disadvantage, as they’re essentially “leaving seats on the table.” This past November, Democrats picked up six seats in districts where they didn’t even compete in 2014. Additionally, their widespread electoral effort might not have produced 2010-like gains, but it gave millions of Americans the opportunity to vote for a congressional Democrat for the first time in years. And encouraging such voting has long-term repercussions locally, statewide and nationally.
Other voting data also supports this trend: Comparing 2006 (small Democratic gains) and 2010 (a monumental Red Wave), Republicans had fewer votes in 2010 in only 59 House districts. But when comparing 2014 and 2018, Democrats had fewer votes in 2018 in only 16 House districts. In other words, Democrats increased their vote totals in over 96 percent of House districts. We could not find evidence of any comparable midterm-to-midterm jump in U.S. history. Consider this statistical improbability when assessing the 2018 election’s impact.
Two other sets of calculations caught our eye. First, comparing the House’s 2006 and 2010 midterms, the GOP earned 25.02 percent more votes, while Democrats netted 7.93 percent fewer votes. The resulting 32.95 percent voting gap makes sense given the Republican Party’s dramatic electoral turnaround. And comparing the House’s 2014 and 2018 midterms, the GOP made a similar vote jump: 25.85 percent. But the Democratic Party advanced by an astounding 67.04 percent votes, resulting in a 41.19 percent voting gap.
Finally, in 312 House districts, Republicans had at least 10 percent more votes in 2010 than in 2006. Comparing 2014 to 2018, Democrats had at least 10 percent more votes in 405 House districts. In fact, the GOP increased its vote total in 101 districts by at least 50 percent in 2006/2010, while Democrats added at least 50 percent to their vote totals in 287 districts from 2014 to 2018. Moreover, in 2010 Republicans more than doubled their 2006 votes in 53 districts; Democrats did the same in 122 districts in the last two midterms.
Experts can argue over whether President Trump
galvanized Democrats more than Republicans. They can ponder whether Democrats’ dramatically improved financial position helped their cause. It’s all moot to the central question: Were the 2018 midterms a Blue Wave? The answer is clear  — 2018 might not have yielded the electoral gains of 2010, but no midterm election in the past century or more has been so lopsided, which almost certainly suggests its impact will be felt in 2020.

0,11/30/18 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/419090-us-starting-to-realize-its-in-an-economic-cold-war-with-china,US starting to realize it's in an economic cold war with China,"A generation removed from the first Cold War, a new one has begun. The new cold war has the U.S. engaged with China, not the USSR. The new cold war is primarily an economic one, not a military one. Yet despite fundamental differences from the past, elements of the past have a fundamental impact on the new cold war. 
The first Cold War lasted four decades. It was punctuated by military conflicts — primarily by proxy, but with notable near-misses of direct engagement. Advantageously transitioning to a primarily economic conflict, Reagan would win the Cold War within a decade.  
Yet, while economic in substance, Reagan’s final engagement was military in form: The U.S. upped defense spending to a level the USSR could not begin to match.
According to the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. defense spending (measured in constant 2009 dollars) increased from $363 billion in 1980 to $538 billion in 1989 (Reagan’s last budget) — a 48-percent real increase. With Vice President George H.W. Bush winning the presidency in 1988, there was no end in sight. 
Applying economic power to military spending was particularly troubling for the USSR. The Soviet Union’s legitimacy rested on having saved the ""Motherland"" in World War II. Its citizens knew the regime’s economic shortcomings, but the Communist Party justified — and enforced — its existence by being on par with the U.S. militarily. 
Unable to produce the needed resources internally, or borrow them externally, the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the USSR in 1991.  
With a mighty military, but moribund economy, the USSR fell from within, lacking an economic infrastructure capable of supporting its military superstructure. China has seen all of this and knows it cannot succeed without that infrastructure.  
As the USSR was teetering, China was transitioning. Having accepted the U.S.’s famous overtures under Nixon, China, through fits and starts, ultimately oriented away from the USSR’s purely authoritarian economic model to what would become a mixed one.    
Instead of the Soviet central planning model attempted by Mao, Deng Xiaoping prevailed, giving comparatively great latitude at the individual level. However, while allowing some autonomy at individuals’ level of the economy, monopoly remained with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at the political level. 
The party adopted a mercantilist approach to development. China’s goal was to earn surplus resources for economic investment through foreign trade. China further bolstered this by inviting foreign investment — an unthinkable break from previous communist developmental models — while still dictating terms with its enormous market strength. 
From China’s perspective, it has been in an economic cold war for some time. The CCP is in a race with the world’s largest population, and with which it has entered an implicit bargain of political rights for economic development. 
The party must stay ahead of the people’s expectations. While the West has complained, China has skillfully played them against themselves — similar to the way Nixon and Kissinger split the two communist colossi in the 1970s. 
The change in this heretofore undeclared economic cold war is that President Trump
has declared it, and appears serious about fighting it.  
As in any war, there are casualties. However, because of China’s large trade surplus with the U.S., China is far more exposed. An even greater threat exists should the West seize the opportunity to coalesce and join the Trump administration’s demand that China fundamentally change its economic model of dictated investment restrictions.  
Further, China is much more internally dependent on its economic relationship with the U.S. and even more so on the mercantilist model it embodies. This model supports China’s economy and its political system. Threatening one is to threaten both. 
China is therefore stuck: To acquiesce and reform can be seen as “losing face” and kowtowing to the West, resurrecting the nation’s most painful historical memories. Yet, replacing the lost economic growth with government-administered stimulus is to court the excesses China most needs to correct. 
Already larded with poorly run state enterprises, the last thing needed is to pump more resources into them and invite a day of reckoning akin to the U.S. housing sector collapse of a decade ago. That day of reckoning is coming and the CCP does not need it forestalled and increased in severity.  
Beyond the economic disruption this will cause, there is also a strong political component far beyond America’s substantial one from its financial crisis.
China’s reckoning will reveal corruption, lies, ineptitude and manipulation — all of which will antagonize its people. There will be no hiding for the CCP, which is simultaneously proprietor and regulator of these enterprises. 
For perspective: Imagine the financial crisis’ fallout on a larger scale and its blame of elected officials, regulators, banks and Wall Street all being concentrated on a single entity. 
Add to this a final Chinese component that has no financial crisis parallel: The Chinese Communist Party took control in 1949 based in part on the people’s disgust at corruption in the previous government. China’s fallout could resonate deeply and negatively in a way Americans cannot understand. 
The economic confrontation that the Trump administration has engaged in with China is indeed a new cold war. It is also an old one — one China has been waging for some time. Yet despite two nations being joined in conflict, it is not an equal one. 
China has far more at stake than the U.S. While the U.S. is fighting on one external front, China is fighting on two: one external, but an even more serious internal one.

’s betrayal and double dealing against Robert Mueller
and his special counsel team appears to be a desperate ploy designed to achieve a presidential pardon, which will fail, because Trump’s attorneys will advise him in ways similar to what I wrote here.
I have long believed that the case for obstruction of justice involving efforts to impede the Mueller investigation is far stronger, based on publicly known evidence, than our public discussion would suggest.
Additionally, I would assert that while a president can lawfully pardon almost anyone, for almost any crime, a pardon could also be crucial evidence in support of an obstruction of justice case, and potentially an additional count in an obstruction of justice case.
 If a pardon is offered to influence a witness in a criminal investigation, that pardon could indeed be a crime.  There has been evidence that earlier in the case, Trump’s lawyers discussed a pardon with Manafort’s lawyers. 
It has been reported as well that Trump’s former White House counsel, Donald McGahn
, has spent many hours cooperating with Mueller and his team. Could McGahn have provided evidence about these alleged pardon discussions?
It is now reported that Manafort was essentially double-dealing against Mueller and his investigators, with his lawyers allegedly reporting confidential information to Trump’s lawyers about his discussions with Mueller while he was supposedly cooperating with Mueller.
If Trump does pardon Manafort, there is a high probability that these matters are ultimately litigated before and decided by the United States Supreme Court.
If Trump does pardon Manafort, the public firestorm of anger and outrage would be so extreme that impeachment consideration would probably be initiated even by a Republican House, and certainly by a Democratic House in January.
The smart move for Senate Republicans would be for them to immediately provide protections for Mueller against a Saturday Night Massacre and to publicly and privately warn Trump to not pardon Manafort or move against Mueller. 
However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) appears to be making the same mistake after the midterm elections that House Republican leaders made before the midterms.
The most under-discussed aspect of Trump’s involvement in the Russia investigation is the statute of limitations.  The statute of limitations for any potential crime that Trump is alleged to have committed would be a minimum of five years from the date that alleged crime was committed.
Let's assume hypothetically that Trump is not re-elected president in 2020 and leaves office in January 2021. In this case, under the statute of limitations, if Trump theoretically had committed any crime during the five previous years, he would not be protected by the statute of limitations.
Trump’s lawyers all know this, and have undoubtedly advised him of this. Trump’s lawyers also know that a federal pardon would not protect him from any theoretical state crimes and have undoubtedly advised him of this as well.
Additionally, if Manafort is pardoned, he would almost immediately be required by Mueller to testify before a grand jury, under penalty of perjury, and would have to testify truthfully, or he would be indicted for new crimes of perjury that would not be covered by the pardon. Trump’s lawyers all know this, and have undoubtedly advised him of this as well.  
In other words, if Trump pardons Manafort, he protects Manafort only to the degree that Manafort tells the whole truth to the grand jury after the pardon.
A pardon would not protect Trump, unless Manafort’s testimony to the grand jury clears him, but if this were the case, Manafort would simply tell this story as part of his cooperation agreement with Mueller.
If Manafort is assuming that Trump will pardon him, he is playing a dangerous game with a very high likelihood that Trump is warned by his lawyers to not pardon him, that he will still be indicted in state courts and that he will be forced to testify before the grand jury after the pardon. 
A Trump pardon of Manafort will be disaster for Trump, Manafort and congressional Republicans alike.

0,11/26/18 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/418298-donald-trump-will-keep-our-american-economy-strong,Donald Trump will keep our American economy strong,"We have all heard the back and forth between politicians and analysts about the Trump economy versus the Obama economy. Democrats thank President Obama. Republicans thank President Trump
. But what do the numbers say and what policies brought us the prosperity we have today? While the economy is complex, it is clear that regulation, employment, and tax cuts are all important factors. Let us compare these issues.
For far too long, the policies of the Obama administration suffocated the economy. In its first two years alone, the Obama administration imposed $245 billion in regulatory compliance costs on businesses and families. The Trump administration quickly hit the ground running with aggressive deregulation. In 2016, there was a record 97,000 pages of regulations in the federal register. The Trump administration took bold action to bring this number down with 22 federal regulations slashed for every single regulation created. Since he assumed office, President Trump has saved the United States $33 billion in regulatory compliance costs.
The unemployment rate is holding steady at 3.7 percent, the lowest level in 49 years. There are a record 7.1 million job openings and wages have been rising. Many argue that the numbers have remained fairly consistent with around 200,000 jobs added each month under both the Obama administration and the Trump administration. But it is important to look at the makeup of these jobs. Around 286,000 jobs in manufacturing were lost under the Obama administration. Under the Trump administration, around 446,000 jobs in manufacturing have been added. Workers from all backgrounds have benefited greatly from this White House agenda.
High taxes made it difficult for the economy to thrive under the Obama administration. While the Trump administration has already worked with Congress on a second round of tax cuts for Americans, there have been promises delivered under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including an average $2,200 more for middle class families. Moreover, a record $300 billion has been repatriated back to the United States. The corporate tax cuts have fueled more consumer confidence and business spending. The economy is on pace to grow above 3 percent for the first time since 2005. Consumer confidence is at the highest level in 18 years. Small business optimism is at the highest level since it was first measured in 1973.
Of course, these are not the only factors in the economy. However, they are significant and comparing the Obama administration with the Trump administration makes it clear that President Obama is not solely to be thanked for our current economic prosperity as many Democrats claim. The growth policies of President Trump have helped us thrive. Our businesses are no longer being excessively overtaxed and regulated. Americans are not only obtaining jobs, but they are finding better ones. We are paying fewer taxes and have greater confidence in our future.

0,11/26/18 01:30 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/418206-midterms-show-moderates-are-far-from-politically-extinct,Midterms show moderates are far from being politically extinct,"For years, partisans and ideologues have assured us that the political center is dead, so don’t bother making persuasive arguments to swing voters. Just get your base out, and may the most “energized” team win. The 2018 midterm elections, however, showed that the center’s demise has been greatly exaggerated.
The big story was the revolt of suburban voters, led by white, college-educated women, against President Trump
’s polarizing populism. Their defection helped Democrats win the popular vote (again), score their biggest gains in the House of Representatives since 1974 and add a slew of new governors.
A national poll by the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) and Expedition Strategies taken on the eve of the midterm provides further evidence that America’s pragmatic center is resilient and bouncing back after two years of Trump’s bizarre presidency.
It suggests that our democracy’s firewalls against demagoguery and extremism are still intact and that Trump’s 2016 win may be an aberration, a detour rather than a fundamental realignment of U.S. politics. 
In fact, our survey illuminates a new political landscape that is favorable to Democrats heading into the 2020 presidential election cycle.
It found that 48 percent of voters identified as Democrats or as independents who lean Democratic, while 39 percent said they were Republicans or lean Republican (the remaining 13 percent were true independents with no allegiance to either party). 
Far from being an extinct political species, moderates matter more than ever. Strong partisans of either stripe were a minority in our poll — a potential sign that the nation may have hit “peak polarization” and is now on its way to a more rational equilibrium.
A plurality of our respondents — 44 percent — called themselves “moderate,” versus 24 percent liberal and 32 percent conservative. Independents are overwhelming moderate (62 percent), potentially an exceptionally important as we look ahead to 2020.
To sustain and build on their midterm gains, Democrats should pursue an agenda that is both progressive and pragmatic. In contrast to Trump’s rancorous populism, the new Democratic agenda should be optimistic and aspirational.
It should affirm core American beliefs in free enterprise, individual initiative and self-reliance, and put strengthening markets’ ability to provide broader opportunities before government redistribution.
Our poll finds that 81 percent of voters say that government’s job should be to “help Americans succeed in a time of change” with more opportunities to acquire skills and save for the future, while just 19 percent prefer that government “cushion the impact of economic change” with a plusher safety net.
We also found little evidence that Americans are yearning for a “bold” or “unapologetic” progressivism as defined by the activist left. Its proposals for guaranteed public jobs and guaranteed income found minimal support, even among Democrats.
More fundamentally, the progressive left’s tendency to conflate “boldness” with statist solutions is a snare for Democrats because voters profoundly distrust the federal government. 
Here are other key findings from the PPI/Expedition Strategies poll: 
Health care lies at the heart of voters’ sense of economic insecurity.
Nearly half of respondents ranked health care as one of their top-three concerns. High costs — especially prescription drug prices — and the fear of losing coverage were voters’ biggest worries.
By substantial margins, they trust Democrats more than Republicans to deliver universal and affordable coverage. Given their anxieties, they seem open to a bigger public role in health care, but at the same time don’t welcome higher taxes. 
Companies need to step it up on wages, but treating the business community as the enemy is a mistake.
Despite the unpopularity of some sectors, voters are not generally anti-business. Few voters, for instance, are worried about corporate monopolies, and most take a favorable view of big technology companies. But voters aren’t inclined to give businesses a free pass when it comes to paying their employees decent, middle-class wages. 
Nationalism is a failing strategy — perhaps even among Trump’s core supporters.
Voters would like to see American companies succeed globally and don’t support closing our economy to foreign trade or Trump’s tariff wars. More broadly, voters would like to see the United States engaged and leading in the world rather than retreating inward and going it alone. 
The federal deficit could be the sleeper issue of 2020.
Americans are growing more concerned about government spending and debt. It ranked as their second-biggest worry, behind drug prices, and fifth on the list of big problems they want Washington to tackle. We also found majority support for repealing the Trump GOP tax cuts and replacing them with payroll tax relief for working families.
Voters are pragmatists on energy and climate change.
A solid majority (58 percent) of respondents view America’s shale oil and gas boom in a positive light because it creates jobs and reduces U.S. reliance on imported oil.
At the same time, they are worried about the environment and support stronger action against climate change. Democrats can win on energy and climate issues — but only if they stop outsourcing their energy policy to green activists and avoid a false choice between fossil fuels and renewable energy. 
Don’t forget immigration.
Immigration isn’t a big worry among Democrats, but it’s a top-tier concern for Republicans and a major concern for independents. It’s not enough for progressives to deplore Trump’s nativism and fear-mongering about caravans and “criminal aliens.”
They also need their own plan for strengthening enforcement of U.S. laws and for updating U.S. immigration policy to reflect the labor needs of a high-skill knowledge economy. 
Americans prefer a responsive local government to a centralized federal government they deeply distrust.
Voters across the political spectrum see Washington as unresponsive, ineffective and dominated by special interests. However, they show a strikingly high level of confidence in local government.
Rather than centralizing more power in Washington, progressives should “go local” and harness local governments as a creative tool for solving national problems from the ground up. 
For progressives, here’s the key takeaway from our national survey: Governing and running in a spirit of “radical pragmatism” is the best bet for delivering the results that Americans crave in ways that ring true to their values.
That’s how mainstream Democratic candidates ousted dozens of GOP incumbents in 2018, and it’s how a pragmatic nominee could send Donald Trump packing in 2020.

0,11/26/18 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/418237-lewinsky-interview-renews-questions-of-clinton-crimes,Lewinsky interview renews questions of Clinton crimes,"The Wall Street Journal and other new outlets report that Democrats are preparing to investigate the alleged hush money payments and efforts by Donald Trump
to cover up his past affairs. There are clearly some legitimate areas of investigation, including possible campaign finance violations. But any such effort could face strong arguments against such inquiries or impeachment from none other than Democrats themselves.
Many of the incoming Democratic House committee leaders opposed such efforts during the Bill Clinton
impeachment 20 years ago. Worse yet, the criminality of Clinton, along with the absence of real accountability, has only become more glaring with time, as shown by the recent interview of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the new A&E docuseries. Among other details, Lewinsky said Clinton encouraged her to lie to the independent counsel, an allegation raising the possibility of a variety of crimes having been committed by Clinton, including the false statement offense used rather extensively by special counsel Robert Mueller
.
The disclosures by Lewinsky reinforce what was previously alleged against Clinton while highlighting that he could have been charged with a number of other crimes. The impeachment centered on the question of whether a president could be impeached for perjury. I appeared in Congress with other experts to debate that question and maintained that lying under oath clearly was an impeachable offense. I disagreed with the other professors at the hearing that there is some subject matter exception for lying about sexual relationships. Federal prosecutors regularly charge people for making false statements without any subject matter limits. The last person you want to give such a license to lie is the president, who heads the executive branch that enforces such laws against all citizens.
While the evidence of perjury was overwhelming, and a federal court affirmed that Clinton committed perjury, Democratic House members voted as a bloc and refused to impeach or convict him. Indeed, many of the lawmakers calling for the investigation and impeachment of Trump previously fought to shield Clinton from such accountability. Back then, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
opposed not only the impeachment but even the investigation of Clinton, insisting that American women viewed his affair with a White House intern to be a private matter and opposed the “uncontrolled power” of independent counsel Ken Starr. Maxine Waters
insisted that Clinton was only “guilty of certain indiscretions in his private life.” Jerrold Nadler, the incoming House Judiciary Committee chairman, at the time declared that “perjury regarding sex is not a great and dangerous offense against the nation.”
Putting aside that perjury is a crime for which other citizens go to jail, the culpability of Clinton was far broader than just his denial. Clinton, much like Trump, was accused of actively trying to influence witnesses and testimony. He arranged for Lewinsky to meet with attorney Vernon Jordan, who was one of his closest friends and political allies. Jordan then arranged for Lewinsky to be represented by his chosen counsel Frank Carter, who drafted a false affidavit denying any affair. That affidavit was notably delayed in being filed as the scandal grew. Lewinsky, who had virtually no work history or relevant background, was offered a job with Revlon, where Jordan was a powerful member of the board of directors.
Lewinsky said, “Frank Carter explained to me if I signed an affidavit denying having had an intimate relationship with the president it might mean I would not have to be deposed in the Paula Jones case.” If Carter knew that the affidavit was false, he committed a deeply unethical act. Lewinsky does not say if Carter knew that she had a sexual relationship with Clinton, but she is clear about one other fact. She stated that Clinton encouraged her to lie to investigators. That would be a federal crime and could be viewed as subornation of perjury and witness tampering.
All of this may seem like ancient history, but history has a way of repeating itself in the most inconvenient ways. None of those four alleged crimes were ever charged against Clinton, and now that the statute of limitations has passed, he will never have to answer for such acts. Yet his alleged crimes could weigh heavily in any consideration of the allegations about Trump and his dealings with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, as well as some of the obstruction allegations. The comparisons between the allegations against Clinton and Trump creates some striking similarities.
Clinton used Jordan, whose company offered Lewinsky a well paid job in public relations. Trump allegedly used David Pecker, owner of the National Inquirer, to give former Playboy bunny Karen McDougal a well paid job as a writer. Clinton allegedly used the lawyer Carter to draw up a false affidavit from Monica Lewinsky that was used in court to deny a sexual relationship. Trump allegedly used lawyer Michael Cohen to draw up a false affidavit from porn star Stormy Daniels to deny a sexual relationship.
Clinton isolated Attorney General Janet Reno over her ordering of an independent counsel investigation. The New York Times and other papers reported how Clinton left Reno “twisting in the wind” and wanted her resignation because “she had been too willing to refer cases” involving his close associates to independent prosecutors. Trump publicly denounced Attorney General Jeff Sessions
for recusing himself and facilitating the “witch hunt” of the investigation into possible Russia collusion. Trump went further in demanding that Sessions resign.
Clinton is accused of directly encouraging a key witness, Lewinsky, to lie to federal investigators. Trump is accused of encouraging people not to “rat” in cooperation with Mueller. Clinton denied an affair with “that woman” while Hillary Clinton
and his surrogates attacked the accusers. Trump drafted the infamous statement on the Trump Tower meeting with Russians that misrepresented its purpose. Clinton and his surrogates relentlessly attacked Starr and demanded the closure of his investigation as unlimited and part of what Hillary Clinton called a “vast right wing conspiracy.” Trump and his surrogates have relentlessly attacked Mueller and demanded the closure of his investigation as unlimited and baseless.
The fact is that both Clinton and Trump warranted the investigations that unfolded during their presidencies. Thus far, however, the clearest evidence of criminal conduct related to the cover up of the affairs runs against Clinton. The account by Lewinsky offers an overwhelming case for criminal conduct by Clinton, a consistent pattern including his alleged encouragement of her lying to investigators, the supply of a Clinton ally for legal advice, the job offer from Revlon, and his own act of perjury.
Does this mean Republicans should now feel free to engage in the same willful blindness and hypocrisy that the Democrats exhibited during the Clinton investigation? Of course not. If Trump lies under oath or suborns perjury by others, the president should be impeached, no question. There can be no exceptions for a nation committed to the rule of law, even if the most powerful politicians are exceptionally gifted at inventing them.

0,11/26/18 10:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/418205-democrats-made-history-this-year,Democrats made history this year,"The 2018 midterm election results are still trickling in but the verdict is clear and more than hopeful than ever for Democrats and many others. Voters used their ballots to send a message to President Trump
: Enough!
Trump campaigned hard and defeated a few red state Democrats in states that he won in 2016. He eked out victory for his candidates by stoking entrenched hatred and bigotry, ragged fears which, in a last hurrah, “trumped” the red state Democratic issues in the Senate of protecting health care and rebuilding our infrastructure. Despite this, the harmful toxins emitted by Trump might not prevail in the Mississippi runoff for Senate this week. The Republican candidate just placed race front and center by embracing vigilante hangings, a step too far for the state where many of our civil rights leaders were lynched, murdered, and buried.
Voters gave Democrats a mandate to share power in Washington and the states, such as the decisive victories for the governorships in Wisconsin and Michigan, two midwest states where Trump squeaked out a 2016 victory, but could not do so in 2018. Democrats prevailed in a toxic atmosphere where Trump controlled the daily narrative. Take a look at the Texas Senate race, which Democrat Beto O’Rourke lost, but he secured the momentum to victory in 2020. Republican Ted Cruz
, the incumbent who contested for the presidential nomination of his party in 2016, won just 51 percent of the vote in one of the reddest states in the nation.
We did not get everything. But Democrats got what we needed to restore a strongly competitive two party system of checks and balances. These election night victories bear repeating. Democrats flipped seven governorships in Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, and formerly rock ribbed Republican Maine. Jared Polis
became the first openly gay man elected governor, while Michelle Lujan Grisham
will become the first Democratic hispanic governor in our history.
It does not stop at governorships. The 2018 blue wave of Democratic candidates will become the most diverse group of elected officials in our history. A record number of more than 120 women will serve in Congress next year with 19 of them Republicans. There were multiple “female firsts” for federal offices, including the first Muslim woman and the first Native American woman elected to Congress. Massachusetts and Connecticut both sent their first black female representatives to Washington.
Democrats took control of seven state legislative chambers and at least 380 state legislative seats flipped to Democratic control. Altogether, Democrats won more than 2,900 state legislator races, over half of those that they contested. Just as significantly, Democrats now hold the attorney general post in over half the states. That will help enormously to ensure fair future elections end the scourge of voter suppression.
It was not just a good election season for Democratic candidates. Democratic values triumphed across the nation as well. Three red states voted to expand Medicaid, bringing health care access to an additional 168,000 people through the Affordable Care Act, known to most of us as ObamaCare. There are now three dozen states along with the District of Columbia that have expanded Medicare coverage for their residents.
Moreover, in a major victory, Amendment 4 passed on election night in Florida. Following the lead of many states, Florida will restore voting rights to people with prior felony convictions. In Massachusetts, voters upheld nondiscrimination protections for transgender people in public spaces. Arkansas and Missouri chose to raise the minimum wage. Ballot measures passed in Maine, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Georgia, and Rhode Island will culminate in millions more for education funding. Finally, multiple states passed bipartisan measures to fight corruption in government ethics, lobbying, campaign finance, and voter rights.
Now we get to the serious business of who will lead the Democratic controlled House in an otherwise Republican controlled Washington. Democrats have their toughest leader ready to take the field in critical times. Nancy Pelosi
served as Speaker under a Republican president. Time and again, she outmaneuvered and outwitted the opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. She is a demonstrated world class negotiator and dealmaker who has what it takes to move the agenda forward. Trump and the Republicans will demonize and vilify whoever the Democrats would chose, but Pelosi has proven impervious to their name calling.
These midterm elections will go down as another year of the woman. The last thing Democrats should do after electing a historic number of women to the Congress is to tell voters that a woman is not equal to the task of taking on an unfeminist president. It is delicious to savor the prospect of these two embattled in the politics of making deals and swapping votes. Pelosi is the best of American women icons in the mold of so many legends. She is fiercely independent, endlessly energetic, deeply passionate, and a can do legislator. She only gets better with age.

0,11/21/18 02:30 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/417813-the-ball-is-in-chinas-court-ahead-of-big-trump-xi-meeting,The ball is in China's court ahead of big Trump-Xi meeting,"Hopes are dim for a rapid conclusion to the U.S.-China trade dispute.
This became clear following the war of words between Vice President Mike Pence
and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and after the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR's) updated Section 301 report released Tuesday that details China’s lack of progress in addressing U.S. complaints related to intellectual property, technology transfer and cybersecurity.
President Donald Trump and President Xi are expected to meet in Buenos Aires on Nov. 30, but even if this encounter comes off without acrimony, it will likely the start of a long period of negotiations.
Chinese offers to buy more U.S. products, such as the soybeans that still await purchasers, will not be enough when the U.S. is looking for fundamental change, i.e., for China to pay for technology rather than steal it and to allow U.S. firms to invest in China without forcing them to hand over corporate secrets.
The USTR report, unfortunately, indicates that rather than moving toward a solution, China “appears to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months.”
What the Chinese side does not appear to understand is that U.S. concerns over investment and technology are bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans seem to fight on nearly everything, but they share the view that important aspects of the change in the U.S.-China relationship must come from the other side.
If anything, look for Democrats to try to be tougher than Trump on trade in an attempt to reclaim the issue ahead of the November 2020 election.
Even groups in the U.S. business community who are traditionally friends of China are frustrated by the lack of progress on intellectual property rights, forced technology licensing and transfer, antitrust enforcement and cybersecurity and data protection.
The implication is that the trade dispute will deepen before it improves, with the next step scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 with an increase in the tariff rate on $250 billion of Chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent.
The task for China is to come forward with enough progress to head this off — a challenge when the first step remains for Chinese officials to recognize that the ball is in their court.
Progress matters for the both countries because the impact of the trade war can be seen in markets and in the economy. Concerns over the profitability of high-flying tech firms have driven Wall Street volatility, but so too has the uncertainty of the trade war.
The prospect of steeper tariffs and Chinese retaliation likewise seems to be holding down business investment, which has lagged even while overall GDP growth surged in the middle of this year.
Persuading American firms to ramp up investment in new factories, software and offices would help sustain U.S. growth at 3 percent even as the near-term stimulus of the December 2017 tax cuts recedes in 2019 and beyond.
The stakes are high for China as well. President Xi need not worry about a sagging economy affecting his re-election prospects — China dispensed with the previous two-term limit in February.
But Chinese growth still depends heavily on exports, and long-lasting tariffs will gradually persuade firms to shift production to other low-cost producers.
There is yet time to head-off serious and long-lasting economic fallout, but not unlimited time. Look for a deal by the end of March 2019 that includes:
a Chinese commitment to buy more U.S. products such as agriculture and energy;
better access for U.S. companies to both export to and invest in China, including in financial services, autos, telecom and health care; and
follow-through on Chinese commitments to protect intellectual property such as by imposing harsher penalties for violations.
Technology competition between the U.S. and China is here to stay, and China will continue to favor its state-owned enterprises. Even so, China can take a big step toward defusing tensions by acknowledging that U.S. complaints are valid and then by demonstrating initial progress in addressing them.
This would then allow President Trump
to play his seemingly-preferred role of pragmatic dealmaker, backing away from the trade war in the interest of U.S. and global economic growth.
That’s the good scenario. The bad one is that China holds fast — and takes its own and global growth down with it.

However, as we approach 2019, there would seem to be two qualitative and disturbing differences in the risks now besetting the global economic recovery.
The first is that there is a higher-than-usual chance that at least some of these risks might materialize. The second is that if any of these risks do materialize, they will do more than the normal degree of harm that such risks generally do.
Among those risks that have a high chance of materializing next year and that could cause serious global economic damage is an intensification of the Italian sovereign debt crisis.
This has to be of concern for both the European and global economies considering that Italy is the eurozone’s third-largest economy and is approximately 10-times the size of the Greek economy.
It is also of concern considering that the Italian government debt market is the world’s third-largest sovereign debt market and that a considerable proportion of the $2.5 trillion of that debt is held by Italian and other European banks.
Another reason for fearing that an Italian debt crisis might have spillover effects to the rest of the global economy and its financial system is that, unlike was the case in the earlier Greek crisis, Italy might prove very difficult for its European partners to save.
It is not simply that very large sums of money would be involved in saving a country of Italy’s size and indebtedness. Rather, it is that it will be difficult to muster political support, especially in Germany, to spend very large sums to stabilize a country whose government is willfully flouting the eurozone’s rules. 
At a time when Europe would like Italy’s budget deficit to be below 1 percent of GDP, the Italian government is insisting on a draft 2019 budget that would have a deficit closer to 3 percent of GDP.
Another and more immediate risk to the global economic recovery could be that of the United Kingdom crashing out of Europe without a Brexit deal by the end of March 2019 when the two-year negotiating period under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon comes to an end.
Were that to occur, intra-European trade flows would likely be disrupted and European investor confidence would be seriously dented. Moreover, there could be problems in the European capital market stemming from setbacks to London.
A reason for fearing that the U.K. could crash out of Europe without a deal, or at the very least be forced into an early and contentious general election, is that Prime Minister Theresa May does not seem to have the votes to secure parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal next month.
With a revolt now under way in her party’s back benches and with her Northern Ireland junior coalition partner firmly opposed to her Brexit deal, the last doubtful straw at which she may clutch is support from the opposition Labor Party.
However, it does not seem to help her cause that Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn appears to be smelling blood, insisting that he could have negotiated a better Brexit deal than did May.  
On a longer fuse, but certainly no less of a threat to the global economic recovery than that coming from Italy and the United Kingdom, would be an economic slowdown in China, the world’s second-largest economy.
Were that to occur, it would have serious ramifications for the rest of the emerging market economies. This is especially the case considering that China is the world’s largest consumer of international commodities.
Heightening the chances that the Chinese economy will indeed slow down over the next year is the likelihood that there will be an appreciable escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.
It would seem from repeated statements by Vice President Mike Pence
that the U.S. now views China more as a serious geopolitical rival rather than as a cooperative trade partner. This could very well lead to President Trump
delivering on his threat to substantially ramp up protection against Chinese imports at the start of the year.
Hopefully, none of the risks mentioned above will materialize. However, it would seem to be irresponsible for the Trump administration to premise its economic policy on the assumption that it will be smooth sailing for the global economy next year.
Rather, the responsible thing to do would be to hope for the best but to plan for the worst and to start mending fences with our economic partners whose help might be needed to contain an international economic crisis.

0,11/17/18 05:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/417187-my-fellow-democrats-should-watch-their-language-economic-equality-is-not-a,My fellow Democrats should watch their language: Economic equality is not a rational societal goal,"There has been an uproar, and a justified one at that, about the rising inequality in the United States in recent decades. Whether you are reading Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century or following the speeches of Senator Bernie Sanders
and Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, this theme has emerged as one of the dominant themes of our time.
As important as the theme is, there is a basic problem with the way it is addressed that requires explanation: economic inequality is different from political and civil inequality. The best explanation of the difference comes from John Rawls, the leading American political philosopher of the 20th Century.
With political and civil inequality, as Rawls explained in A Theory of Justice (1971), we rightly can argue that there is no justification. We did deny the right to vote to women and African-Americans for long periods of our nation’s history, but today no major political party or candidate for office would even think of saying that women or African-Americans should not be permitted to vote.
Now there are of course various ways that state governments can make it more difficult for individuals to exercise their right to vote, but no one is going to take the position that, say African-Americans – because they are African-Americans – should be denied the right to vote.
Other political and civil rights are the same. All of them – right to religious freedom, right to free speech, right to assembly, and so on – are rights that every citizen has.
But economic inequalities are different. The gap between rich and poor and indeed rich and middle-class Americans, has indeed grown in recent decades. The very rich, the top 1 percent, do indeed have too much wealth and income.
Rawls argued that it would be irrational to have a modern industrial society in which there was no economic inequality.
After all, if we create a society in which we have economic equality then we have a society where every adult has the same amount of money and resources as every other; moreover, the overall economic pie (namely gross domestic product) would be much smaller in a society where everyone was treated the same (which would be a version of communism) than a society in which there were different economic classes and an incentive structure.
If we don't want economic equality because the standard of living for everyone will be too low, then how much inequality is justified?
This is the puzzle.
Rawls’s solution was to argue that economic inequalities must be arranged “so that they work to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.” Therefore, economic inequality in a society is justified if the inequality enables the poorest citizens to do better than every societal model which permitted economic inequalities. In short, if you are going have a division between rich and poor then the poor must have a better life and more opportunities for social mobility than any other possible society.
The problem with how the concept of economic equality in American politics is discussed arises chiefly with Democrats, namely the party which gives considerable attention to addressing economic inequality. Many Democrats frequently do argue for equal opportunity, especially in education and the workplace. And the language of “equal opportunity” is on safe ground. But too often the overarching arguments are to eliminate economic inequality and promote economic equality. And this can lead voters to misunderstand what the Democrat in question is promoting.
Moreover, frequently the media accentuates the problem by indicating or implying that a Democrat in question is calling for economic equality – rather than equality of opportunity – either with titles or subheadings to articles or claims within articles.
The problem is not that Democrats argue for policies that would require societal economic equality. The problem is that they talk about economic equality as a goal, and this makes it harder for voters to understand what they are for and what they are against.
The problem is when politicians – in speeches and campaigns designed to inspire – toss around the term equality with too much ease, when they call for a society that promotes equality. Citizens latch onto ideas like this and fail to appreciate the difference between political and civil equality and economic equality.
We do not need voters to be inspired by distorted thoughts and values. It is this kind of thinking that promotes polarization and dysfunction. We have one party thinking it is the party of freedom (Republicans) and another thinking it is the party of equality (Democrats). This oversimplification of the Red vs Blue debate enlists new voters on either side and the hard issues never get discussed with clarity.
Encouraging voters to want economic equality the same way they want, and should want, political and civil equality is a gross error.
Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives who plan to push legislation in the name of economic equality should adjust their talking points.

President Trump
said he has finished working on the questions submitted to him by special counsel Robert Mueller
, declaring, “I answered them very easily.”
If there is one universally accepted fact in this political morass, it is that nothing is easy about this investigation, let alone “very” easy. Reports indicate that Trump was given a couple dozen questions that focused on Russian collusion allegations and other matters before his inauguration. That alone defies any “easy peasy lemon squeezy” responses.
It ignores what the questions notably did not include, which is a single query about obstruction of justice. That is an ironic twist, since some of us opposed the appointment of a special counsel after the 2016 election but changed our minds when Trump unwisely fired then FBI director James Comey
in the midst of the Russia investigation. That act triggered the obstruction investigation and produced an overwhelming level of support for an independent investigator. Had Trump just fired Comey at the outset of his administration, or waited for the conclusion of the investigation, it is likely that all of this would have been ended long ago.
The omission of obstruction questions can mean a variety of different things, from the mundane to the horrific. It may be that Mueller concluded earlier that obstruction was not a serious allegation, which would explain why Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
did not recuse himself for being a witness in that investigation. Or it could mean that, given White House opposition to obstruction questions, Mueller will leave that matter to the Congress after he issues his special counsel report.
Finally, and this is the most difficult course, Mueller could be prepared to hit Trump with a subpoena to answer the rest of the questions that fall under his mandate. The assumption, or at least the profound hope, is that his statement was signature bravado and that, in reality, Trump is yielding to counsel on the content of his answers. The concern obviously is his penchant for speaking his mind and making impulsive statements. Indeed, the second most scary six words uttered in this controversy followed the first. Trump stated that it “didn’t take very long to do them.”
If Trump believes these questions are really just about whether he personally colluded with the Russians, he has not been paying attention to the developments in the investigation. The list of Mueller indictments shows that collusion is largely immaterial to most of his prosecutions. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort
was prosecuted entirely for matters predating the election and separate from collusion allegations. Virtually all of the remaining American defendants were charged with unrelated crimes or with making false statements to investigators.
The point is that it was not easy for them to answer the questions, but it was relatively easy for Mueller to indict them. Lawyers for Trump evidently delayed submission of his answers due to concerns over possible “perjury trap” questions. If Trump answers with any specificity, his responses will be overlaid with the testimony of a host of cooperating witnesses, from former national security adviser Michael Flynn to former Trump “fixer” Michael Cohen. If statements by Trump do not match up, Congress will then be left with a stark choice over who is lying on the issue.
Putting aside that obvious danger, there also is the fact that the answers will have a profound impact on the next stage of this controversy. They will clear the way for Mueller to issue a report on Russian collusion. It also would give him ample reason to separate that report from a report on other potential crimes such as obstruction. That would mean Congress could conceivably receive a report early in the new year. With the House under Democratic control then, that could trigger a flurry of investigations and subpoenas even before an obstruction report arrives on Capitol Hill.
With only two years remaining in his term as president, the Democrats will be rapidly losing runway to get any investigation off the ground, at least if they hope to preserve time for a possible impeachment. This is not to say there is any indication of a serious crime related to collusion linked to Trump. The most serious but least likely allegation is that Trump somehow conspired with Russians to hack the computer systems of his opponent. The timing and structure of that operation, described in prior filings, would seem to undermine such an allegation.
That leaves a second possible allegation that the Russians did not give advance notice of their hacking efforts, but made Trump or his aides a type of accessory after the fact in the use of the purloined emails. That tack appears to have been a focus of Mueller in drilling down on figures like Trump associate Roger Stone
. However, there is no crime in Trump celebrating or even inviting the release of hacked emails, as he did on the campaign trail repeatedly and controversially before the 2016 election.
Finally, there could be allegations that Trump offered assurances to the Russians about some quid pro quo in exchange for the release of the Clinton campaign emails. The promise of any official act in exchange for a political favor could raise corruption allegations, as shown by the conviction of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who went to prison for trying to trading a Senate appointment for campaign donations.
However, using or encouraging the public release of hacked emails is not a crime, absent some direct role in a precursor crime. Hillary Clinton
and Democratic leaders were undermined by the hacked emails because those showed they were misleading or lying to the public on various issues. Many critics aside from Trump celebrated the disclosure of such false statements by major political figures. Of course, the disclosures were one sided and clearly calculated to hurt Clinton and help Trump.
Yet, without a quid pro quo, it is hard to discern even a conceivable crime. The most likely crime remains unchanged from my first column on this controversy written two years, which is false statements. Trump is answering questions following hundreds of hours of testimony and millions of pages of evidence gathered from other witnesses. This is why there is nothing “easy” about answering these questions by the president as opposed to the ease of using those answers by a special counsel.

0,11/16/18 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/417164-record-campaign-spending-for-election-is-good-for-democracy,Record campaign spending for election is good for democracy,"Election Day is like the Kentucky Derby for political nerds. It does not happen out of nowhere. A lot of people donate a lot of time and money to make the national event meaningful. Federal campaign spending for the 2018 midterm elections reached an estimated $5.2 billion. That sets a record for the most expensive midterm elections cycle in our history. It is also sure to spark calls for new laws restricting money in politics.
Before we rush to regulate, however, it is important to understand what campaign finance does and does not do. It is also important to have context for how much there really is. For example, while $5 billion is a certainly lot of money, the National Retail Federation estimates that Americans spent $9 billion on Halloween this year on candy, costumes, decorations, and more. Is it too much to spend a fraction of that amount informing and persuading voters about the choices on their ballot?
Money in politics is spread across many different races and candidates. All 435 seats in the House were up for election this year, plus 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate. Those races together feature thousands of candidates all trying to make their case to the voters. It is no wonder the costs pile up. Much of the surge in campaign spending was due to a record number of donations from women and small donors. Many candidates on both sides of the aisle raised large sums, but Democrats in particular rode a wave of voter enthusiasm to unprecedented fundraising.
Campaign finance laws bar candidates from using donations for personal expenses. So these campaign funds cover staff, travel, polling, materials, and other resources that can fuel a winning campaign. The more money a campaign raises, the more it can promote its message and educate voters. This is one way that money in politics can benefit democracy.
For most candidates, the top expense is advertising. Campaign ads can be annoying, but research shows they make voters more informed and engaged. For political newcomers unknown to voters, ads and even yard signs are crucial to building up name recognition. Even established politicians often find advertising is the best way to reach busy citizens.
Research also shows campaign money helps challengers more than it does incumbents. That is because incumbents have a head start before the first dollar is spent. Incumbents are better known among voters, they have lists of past supporters to call on, and they have more chances to attract media coverage through their actions and statements in office.
Campaign spending helps challengers and newcomers catch up. This turns the traditional notion that campaign spending only helps the “establishment” on its head. While money is necessary for a successful campaign, it does not “buy” elections. Voters can and often do reject candidates who outraise and outspend their opposition. Beto O’Rourke became the latest in a long list of big spenders who lost. Hillary Clinton
, Jeb Bush, and Jon Ossoff are just a few from the last two years.
Taking stock of what campaign money can and cannot do should make Americans rethink laws that restrict it. Rather than protecting the average voter from the power of big donors, limits on money in our campaign finance system make it harder to achieve political change of any kind. They create a world where celebrities, media darlings, and the wealthy have huge advantages over anyone else trying to run for office.
Americans are sometimes accused of taking our rights and liberties for granted. In the 21st century, you cannot support the First Amendment, and your favorite candidates, without putting your money where your mouth is. It takes a lot of time and work to make elections successful. Let us take a moment to be thankful for the candidates and volunteers who make our democracy vibrant and ensure that voters have a choice.

0,11/15/18 12:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/416873-florida-has-chance-to-redeem-itself,Florida has chance to redeem itself,"George W. Bush did not win the 2000 election in Florida and the presidency because the United States Supreme Court halted the hand recount of ballots with him ahead by 537 votes. A study by eight news organizations found that Bush would likely still have prevailed with a full recount under the rules set by the Florida Supreme Court at the time. Bush won and Democratic candidate Al Gore
lost because under those state rules, the recount did not consider some 114,000 overvotes, where more than one candidate seemingly was marked on the ballot.
Although it was not possible to ascertain voter intention on all such ballots, the intention was evident on many tens of thousands of overvotes, the great majority of which were cast for Gore. Florida election officials this year have the opportunity to rectify the mistakes of 2000, because current rules announced by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner include both undervotes and overvotes in a hand recount of the ballots.
Florida election officials rejected as invalid nearly 180,000 ballots in 2000, or about 3 percent of the total 6,000,000 votes across the nation. About one-third of the rejected ballots were undervotes, where a vote could not be accurately determined from the machine count. Florida election officials manually recounted these ballots, poring over the infamous hanging chads and dimples on punch card ballots to ascertain whether they could detect a missed vote. About two-thirds of the rejected ballots were overvotes. The machine recount discarded overvotes even if a voter punched in “Al Gore” and then wrote down “Al Gore” to ensure that there would be no mistaking their intention. The state included none of these ballots in the hand recount under rules at the time.
My 2001 study of the 2000 election in Florida for the United States Commission on Civil Rights found that African Americans, who voted 95 percent for Gore in the state, were heavily overrepresented among rejected overvoted ballots. Had all such ballots been recounted by hand it is highly likely that Gore would have easily overcome the lead Bush had from recounted undervoted ballots. My study remains available online.
Three years later, political science professor Walter Mebane of the University of Michigan validated my findings in a ballot by ballot study of every uncounted overvoted vote for the presidency across the state of Florida in the 2000 election. He found that “more than 50,000 votes that were intended to go to either Bush or Gore but instead were discarded.” If all such ballots had been tallied in the election, Mebane concluded in his research that “Gore would have won by more than 30,000 votes.”
Florida election officials this year have an opportunity to fully determine voter intention on all ballots in the hand recount that will likely follow the machine recount in the races for senator and agriculture commissioner and possibly for governor as well. A spread of 0.25 percent or less between the candidates after the machine recount is completed will automatically trigger the hand recount under state law. Florida election officials must examine impartially and as carefully as possible voter intention on each overvoted ballot rejected in the machine count. Republicans must embrace such intense scrutiny of voter intention.
Republicans celebrated when a reexamination of overvoted ballots in the 2017 contest for the 94th district for the Virginia House of Delegates changed a Democratic victory to a tie vote. The Republican candidate then won a random drawing to break the tie, which sealed party control of the House by a single seat. “The outcome is clear,” said winning candidate David Yancey. The outcome will be equally clear in the manual recount in the election in Florida this year if officials apply the same standards of exacting review of overvotes that gave Yancy his victory in Virginia.

In what was, without doubt, one of the most historical cabinet decisions in decades, May won the backing of pro- and anti-EU government ministers, despite rumours of impending resignations.
Speaking outside 10 Downing Street immediately after, May, who has battled ferociously to keep her minority government together since losing her parliamentary majority last year, stressed, ""I firmly believe with my head and my heart this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom.""
On Thursday, May will deliver a statement in the House of Commons outlining the central elements of the Brexit divorce negotiations.
The text of the withdrawal agreement runs to over 400 pages and outlines the terms under which Britain will leave the EU after 45 years of membership. The most significant aspects include protecting the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and British citizens living in EU member states.
These rights, for millions of people, have been guaranteed. Additionally, it covers the divorce bill. To exit the EU, Britain will pay the equivalent of $45 billion, money that Britain legally agreed to contribute to the EU before the 2016 referendum; it will also cover costs incurred during the transition period, which will end in 2020. The transition period can be extended by mutual agreement. 
Crucially, it is during the transition period that the new trade relationship between Britain and the EU will be negotiated. Even though London is leaving the world’s largest free-trade area with a market of over 500 million people, access to the EU’s internal market is seen as vital to the British economy.
During tough talks in Brussels since late 2016, the EU flatly refused to discuss the divorce deal in parallel with a separate negotiation on the shape of a trade deal.
The withdrawal agreement includes a short, non-binding political declaration on the future trade relationship but the nature of that relationship remains unclear, including what access and on what terms Britain can trade in goods and services with the EU after 2020. 
The third and most politically challenging aspect of Wednesday’s withdrawal agreement involves Northern Ireland, which is part of Britain, and its land border with the Republic of Ireland.
Since losing her parliamentary majority last year, May’s minority government has ruled with the support of the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland.
While both London and Dublin wanted to avoid the return of a hard, physical border, the DUP has exerted significant political pressure on May to ensure that Northern Ireland does not remain effectively locked into an EU customs arrangement while the rest of the U.K. leaves the EU, feared by many in the DUP as the first step toward a possible reunification of the island of Ireland.
In the end, the agreement means the whole of the U.K. will remain within the EU’s customs union while a trade deal is negotiated.
On paper, the outcome, though scant on details regarding the future trade partnership between London and Brussels, represents the best arrangement May was ever likely to secure before Britain formally leaves the EU on March 29.
Despite months of intense negotiations on the terms of Brexit, her biggest obstacle remains: convincing a majority of MPs in a deeply divided British Parliament to support the deal when it comes to a formal vote later this year.
Despite the historic nature of Wednesday’s cabinet decision, the last stage of May’s most tortuous Brexit journey lies immediately ahead.

0,11/15/18 08:30 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/416344-debate-over-american-exceptionalism-is-over,Debate over American exceptionalism is over,"American nationalism was indicted as a cover for xenophobia and racism in the midterm elections. Yet, absent U.S. nationalism’s strongly positive side, the related concept of American exceptionalism fails.
Opponents deride American exceptionalism as braggadocio or narcissism. They point to original national failings of slavery and Jim Crow, of the late acceptance of women’s rights and equality. Proponents sometimes fail to make their case and reflexively wave the flag instead.
The case for U.S. exceptionalism — why President Bill Clinton
’s secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, was correct to call this country “the indispensable nation” — is overwhelming, however.
Exhibit A: The survival and spread of Western-style liberal democracy, of human freedom.
Three times in the 20th century it was U.S. intervention and leadership that tipped the balance toward the West in global conflicts. In World War I, the enemy was German militarism; in World War II, Japanese imperialism and, especially, fascism in its Nazi epitome. No sooner were the Nazis crushed by an alliance of necessity that joined Moscow with Washington and London than America led the West in an ultimately successful 40-year Cold War struggle against Soviet imperialism. 
In any one of those conflicts, but for American arms, money and troops, the enemies of liberal capitalist societies might well have triumphed. George Orwell’s fear that the future would be “a boot stamping down on a human face, forever” might have been realized.
Today a would-be-successor tyranny, Islamism, finds itself confronted by American-led forces. Opportunistic Russia, expansionist China and aggressive police states in theocratic Iran or in Kim-dynastic North Korea each must reckon primarily with the United States. 
Exhibit B: The magnetic pull of the American way of life.
For most of the 21st century, roughly 1 million immigrants, legal and illegal, have entered the United States annually. No other country has exhibited such a draw on foreigners, and done so for the majority of its 243-year existence. 
“The United States has been the top international destination for international migrants since at least 1960,” according to the Migration Policy Institute. One-fifth of the world’s migrants were living in America in 2017, the institute reported.
In 1850, 2.2 million people — nearly 10 percent of the country’s population — were immigrants. In 2016, 43.7 million people, or 13.5 percent of the total U.S. population of 323.1 million, were immigrants. The Pew Research Center estimates that approximately one-fourth of them, 11 million, entered illegally.
Immigrants and their American-born children amounted to 86.4 million, or 27 percent, of the total population in 2016. India, China and Hong Kong, and Mexico top the current list of countries abandoned by migrants for America. Why do they come?
The answer lies in Exhibit C: The developments that made exhibits A and B possible.
Historian Niall Ferguson, in “Civilization: The West and the Rest,” argues that “six killer apps” — competition, science, property, modern medicine, the work ethic and consumerism — sparked the rise and 500-year dominance of the West. Nowhere did these six coalesce earlier and more lastingly than in “Old England” and “New England,” Great Britain and the United States.
They did so in the long, often halting development — from the Magna Carta in 1215 through, in America, the Declaration of Independence in 1776 to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — of the recognition that the state exists to serve the people, not the other way around. Immigrants flock to the United States to share in a freer, more prosperous, safer and more stable society than those they leave. Diverse in their origins, they move from a multitude of cultures to a particular one promising opportunity.
They so often find it in the United States. That happens because this country grows from the Declaration’s truly revolutionary assertion “that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”
Virtually no other nation has had such a starting point, so no other has been able to serve as such an international beacon, influence and leader. Exceptional.

remains as committed as ever to his America first agenda. As much as Trump is obstructed by the extreme liberals that comprise most of the Democratic Party and mainstream media, nothing much will change for the president as he fights for the forgotten men and women of our country.
Indeed, one thing Trump cannot be credibly accused of is lacking the courage to stand by his convictions. From the very start of his candidacy for president, he was mocked and spurned by the global elite, the political class, the mainstream media, and even the establishment of his own Republican Party. Not only did he persevere to win, he stuck to his positions despite the “experts” and their widespread derision. Only a man with his vision and his force of will could have accomplished that.
To this day, the fake news media call Trump every epithet they can conjure up. Politicians of lesser conviction routinely collapse in the face of such baseless attacks, but the president almost seems to draw strength from them. When the combined might of the mainstream media and establishment forces failed to thwart his election, they immediately set out to undermine the entire Trump administration with outright fabrications, gross exaggerations, and carefully laid traps.
Most notoriously, they alleged that his campaign had “colluded” with Russia, while the true source of that came from information concocted through the use of the FBI by the Obama administration to spy on members of the Trump campaign. Most of us would find it disconcerting, if not outright nerve wracking, to be the subject of an open investigation backed by the full resources of the federal government, but Trump has acted with admirable restraint, declining to use his authority to rein in or shut down the special counsel investigation. To be sure, he has repeatedly and justifiably criticized its motives and tactics, but he has never once given any indication that he fears what Robert Mueller
might uncover.
Trump has brought that same fearlessness to the Oval Office, taking courageous positions on matters of both foreign and domestic policy and will continue to do so with the help of a stronger Republican majority in the Senate in the wake of the recent midterm elections. His reliably strong convictions have established America once again as the sole world superpower, as well, providing total clarity about where he stands.
When Syria illegally used chemical weapons against both civilians and rebel forces, Trump ordered a massive aerial strike to cripple the ability of the regime to use those weapons again, which Obama failed to do even after his purported “red line” crossed. Similarly, Trump has ordered sanctions against Russia even while seeking rapprochement with our wily rival, tore up the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, and braved dissent within his own party to bring real pressure on our NATO allies to pay their pledged share toward maintaining our international defense.
On the home front, Trump has consistently demonstrated impressive resolve, even against daunting political odds. When the allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh
first broke, and most Republicans were doing their best to avoid television cameras so that they would not have to address the matter, the president boldly stood behind his nominee and assured the American people that Kavanaugh would ultimately be vindicated and confirmed to serve on the bench.
One reason for the political fearlessness of Trump lies in his unique relationship with the American people. He does not need to tailor a message with a focus group, because he can go directly to the men and women across the country, trusting in his own talent to communicate clearly his vision to them in a way they will understand and support.
Whatever your personal feelings about the president, it is clear that he cannot be cowed into submission the way so many politicians have in the past. That is bad news for his opponents, but it is great news for the American people, who are the true beneficiaries of his grit and fearless determination. With the midterm elections behind us, look for a number of changes in Washington, but do not count Donald Trump among them.

0,11/14/18 08:30 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/416517-split-congress-portends-short-term-market-gains-long-term-pains,"Midterms and markets: Short-term gains, long-term pains","The 2018 U.S. midterm elections delivered the widely expected result of a split Congress. Democrats regained a majority in the House of Representatives, while Republicans maintained control of the Senate.
The market reaction was fairly muted, probably reflecting the lack of surprise. U.S. stocks briefly rallied the day after the election, but a week later the market has given back all those gains.
What’s more, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields are actually lower and the yield curve flatter than they were in the days before voters went to the polls. 
Generally speaking, it’s conventional wisdom that markets like divided governments. That should be especially true this time, after the previous Republican majority delivered the first substantial corporate tax cut in 30 years, and President Trump
continues to use executive orders to roll back regulations.
Corporate America could not have expected much more had Republicans held on to both houses. The National Federation of Independent Businesses' monthly optimism index has tracked the greatly reduced headwind from excessive taxes and red tape since the Trump election.
It should be a fair assumption that a potential slowdown in new legislation alone won’t turn the current bullish business sentiment. Maybe that’s why markets are fairly flat post-election. All the good news is priced in, but the new political landscape is unlikely to turn market-unfriendly.
However, a divided government likely means a number of critical intermediate-term problems won't be addressed for at least another two years.
One of these key issues is health care. Although attempts to overturn the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in Congress failed last year, the Trump administration and the Republican Congress have weakened the effectiveness of the ACA.
Eliminating the individual mandate has seriously undermined the revenue assumption for health insurance companies, which is pushing up plan costs. The Trump administration reacted to rising prices by allowing insurance companies to eliminate previously mandated benefits to offset the revenue shortfall.
Unless we return to the fundamental plan structure that made the ACA work, health care could once again become a serious headwind in terms of cost for consumers. 
Another key issue markets have been ignoring is the dramatic increase in the federal budget deficit, which leaves the government woefully underprepared for a sudden downturn in economic growth or worse, a recession.
It’s not surprising that equity markets are ignoring such a risk and have fallen for the sugar high of surging corporate profits that have been largely bought with future generations’ taxes and not with improvement in productivity.
A sudden market rejection of the surging supply of U.S. Treasuries and a sharp increase in bond yields may very well be the biggest domestic risk to further equity market appreciation.
That brings me back to the potential benefits of divided government. It’s not that Republican control of Congress delivers a better fiscal outcome for the country.
After years of vocal opposition to deficits when Republicans were in the minority — remember the Tea Party? — what happened when the party regained the power to shape the nation’s already unsustainable fiscal path? A large tax cut and a large spending increase led to an even bigger hole in the federal balance sheet.
Relegating Republicans back to the opposition benches may rekindle the kind of fiscal conservatism that prevents further fiscal follies such as additional tax cuts or a massive infrastructure spending bill.
The irony is that President Trump, who has publicly campaigned for exactly that, may find more support in a Democratic House of Representatives. Hence, divided government may be the best defense against a further deterioration in the U.S. debt trajectory. 
The 2018 midterms were an unequivocal victory for the Democrats, but the yet-unconfirmed increase in the Republican Senate majority has muddied the waters enough to prevent Republicans from recognizing that immigration isn’t the most important issue for voters.
The party that can formulate a convincing message on health care and the restoration of fiscal prudence may very well win back the center in 2020 and with that, the presidency.

and Jim Jordan
. This will be the Republicans fourth leader in the last 12 years, a period of time when the Democrats have had only one, with presumed Speaker Nancy Pelosi
. But the pattern for Republican instability goes back further. History has shown that the Republicans are quick with the hook and do not follow traditional lines of succession.
The majority leader has an almost guaranteed succession to become speaker. For 16 straight speaker changes, this pattern held. But the tradition shook when Newt Gingrich, who was credited with leading the Republicans out of the political wilderness for the first time in 40 years in 1994, started losing the support of his members, leading to a failed coup. A relatively poor performance in the 1998 midterms led to his resignation.
In a break with the pattern, Majority Leader Dick Armey was skipped by the Republicans, who looked to Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Livingston to serve as speaker. Thanks to a sex scandal, the presumptive leadership succession did not last to the swearing in. The Republicans then went much further down the leadership ladder, selecting Deputy Majority Whip Dennis Hastert
, who managed to remain speaker for eight years until the Republicans lost their majority.
Hastert was succeed by Majority Leader John Boehner
, leader of the failed Gingrich coup, who himself managed to jump the line back into power by defeating Roy Blunt
, the acting majority leader and then majority whip following the resignation of House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Boehner
rose to speaker after the Republicans gained control in the 2010 elections, but he too met an inglorious end, as Republican backbenchers, including Jordan, help lead him to quit as speaker in 2015, even though the party had recently scored significant wins. Once again, the Republicans chose to ignore the promotional path and skipped making Majority Leader McCarthy the speaker. Instead, they looked to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman and former vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan
.
The willingness of the Republicans to fire their leaders goes back even before the recent run in the majority. The last Republican speaker before Gingrich was Joseph Martin, who was later was kicked out of the role of minority leader by Charles Halleck, who was then ousted by Gerald Ford. After Ford was named vice president, his successor John Rhodes did not run for reelection following threats from other members. Robert Michel, the successor to Rhodes, bowed out right before the Republicans scored the majority when Gingrich made it clear that he would run against Michel for speaker. It has been assumed that the Republicans followed this pattern due to their inability to recapture the majority, but it has clearly continued even when the Republicans had the upper hand in the House.
The Democrats have a completely different history. Under Pelosi, the party has lost numerous elections, along with the majority back in 2010, but she has not faced a serious threat to her control. Similarly, her predecessor Dick Gephardt only left the leadership to run for president. Every speaker from the party served as majority or minority leader before taking the gavel, and only one was clearly pushed out. That was Jim Wright, who resigned due to scandal. Even when the Democrats lost the House as far back as 1918, the speaker or majority leader became the minority leader.
Reports suggest that McCarthy has the edge in his race for minority leader, a position that is a bit easier to get than speaker, simply because you only need a majority of party membership, not a majority of the entire House. However, the Republican record suggests that McCarthy should be wary of Jordan and any other contender who may try to challenge him. Moreover, he should be very worried about future attempts to dethrone him. The Republicans have been very willing to get rid of its leaders.

0,11/12/18 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/416283-republicans-must-learn-from-the-election-mistake-on-immigration,Republicans must learn from the election mistake on immigration,"What is the midterm lesson for President Trump
and the Republican Party? Shelve the divisive anti-immigration platform and go in favor of a uniting pro-growth message to avoid losing more ground the next election.
No one embodies this lesson better than Kris Kobach, the Republican candidate for governor in Kansas. Kobach is a longtime and vocal immigration critic. He is the architect of harsh anti-immigration legislation in Arizona and Alabama that courts have largely invalidated. He also headed up the quixotic and now disbanded White House voter fraud commission. He successfully primaried sitting Republican governor John Colyer with the backing of Trump. Yet he managed to handily lose his race last week in Kansas, a state that Trump won by 20 points two years ago.
Throughout the country, suburban districts filled with college educated and pro-immigration voters were the bulkhead upon which the blue wave crashed. South of Miami, Democrats picked up House seats held by Republican Carlos Curbelo
and the outgoing Ileana Ros Lehtinen. West of Washington and east of Denver, incumbents Barbara Comstock
and Mike Coffman
lost by significant margins. In Texas, Pete Sessions
and John Culberson
lost in the Dallas and Houston suburbs. West of Chicago, Peter Roskam
and Randy Hultgren
lost in the suburbs as well.
Democrats flipped multiple suburban seats near Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and Detroit. Incumbent Dave Brat lost his reelection bid in the Richmond suburbs. Even Mia Love
and Keith Yoder in the conservative leaning Salt Lake City and Kansas City suburbs lost their seats. If 2016 was the election of the disaffected Democrats in the midwest, then 2018 was the revolt of the moderate Republicans across the suburbs.
Rather than engage in a positive campaign featuring tax cuts, wage increases, full employment, and 3 percent economic growth that would appeal to suburban voters, President Trump chose to campaign on the caravan, birthright citizenship, and homages to his unpopular family separation policy. Republican election ads suggested immigrants were violent criminals. Trump called it the “election of the caravan.”
Despite what the comments section at the Daily Caller may suggest, there are not enough anti-immigrant voters to win close elections. According to exit polls, 22 percent of voters listed immigration as the most important issue facing the nation. Nearly twice as many voters listed health care as the top issue, while nearly three times as many listed health care or the economy. According to a national poll this fall, voters say immigration helps the country rather than hurts it by a margin of two to one.
Even as a rallying issue for the core Republican base, it is unlikely that immigration is best. Among the top issue immigration voters, 75 percent were Republicans. Yet an internal Republican National Committee memo found that a mere 12 percent of respondents said illegal immigration was the most important problem facing the country. While the anti-immigrant rhetoric toward the end of the campaign may have driven up Republican turnout in rural areas on election night, these parts of the country are shrinking in favor of growing suburbs. The memo thus recommended mobilizing establishment Republican and independent voters.
Meanwhile, the immigration obsession of the Republicans seemed to energize independent and moderate voters. According to exit polls, white women with a college education, a group that has been especially turned off by recent White House immigration policies, voted for Democrats over Republicans by a margin of 59 percent to 39 percent. By a margin of three to one, nonwhite voters, whose population numbers are rapidly growing, pulled the lever for Democrats in an increase from two years ago.
Recent elections, including special elections this year, have not yielded campaign dividends and may have generated blowback for Republican candidates attacking immigrants. Outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan
even called the president before the midterms to beg him to lay off the fear mongering on the trail. Republicans cannot allow the retirements of Ryan and other Republicans in favor of immigration to symbolize the further degeneration of the party from pro-growth to anti-immigrant.
To have a chance to win back the suburbs, which will increasingly determine state and national races, Republicans should reach out and make common cause with immigrants over shared values of hard work, family, and faith rather than write them off as a lost cause. To demonstrate they have learned this lesson, the reported purge of White House officials after this midterm election should continue with advisers like Stephen Miller who feed the worst anti-immigrant impulses of the president.

0,11/11/18 11:00 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/415973-woodrow-wilson-the-bible-and-the-end-of-the-great-war,"Woodrow Wilson, the Bible, and the end of the Great War","Today, at the eleventh hour, humanity commemorates the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. Nineteen million people had perished in the conflict; another 23 million had been wounded. The empires of central and eastern Europe lay in ruins. Affected peoples around the globe looked primarily to one man — U.S. President Woodrow Wilson — to build a just and durable peace. Poorly understood in our day is the degree to which Wilson, both in making war and seeking peace, operated on biblical principles.
He faced fundamental questions: Should this war, if successful, merely represent the triumph of the empires of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States over those of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Turks? Or should it look to a more profound goal?
Wilson’s famed peace plan, the “Fourteen Points,” stands as a model of Christian optimism and charity. He declared that “the day of conquest and aggrandizement is gone by”; so also the day of secret treaties. “We have no jealousy of German greatness,” he continued. “We do not wish to injure her or block in any way her legitimate influence or power.”
Wilson urged that captive peoples in Europe and the Middle East be set free, that borders be redrawn to conform to the peoples living there, and [in a very American blow to every form of European imperialism] that “all colonial claims” now weigh the interests of the native peoples, as well.
With its armies in retreat, Germany finally agreed to an Armistice ending the war on November 11, with peace to rest on the Fourteen Points.
When the crown jewel of Wilson’s peace plan, “a general association of nations” to secure mutual peace and security, finally appeared in 1919, it bore a distinctive biblical title: “The Covenant of the League of Nations.”
“Covenant” is a motif central to both Jewish and Christian Scriptures. At its most basic level, a covenant is an oath-bound relationship between two or more parties. The operative biblical idea is relationship – a community of mutual obligation and benevolence, of common well-being. It’s the same word the Bible uses to describe the marriage relationship. Wilson’s vision for the Covenant of the League of Nations was informed by this scriptural idea. How did the idea of covenant come to shape Wilson’s foreign policy?
Wilson’s father was a prominent Presbyterian minister while his mother descended from several generations of pastors. Christianity, in one biographer’s words, was “a way of life” for this family. Wilson’s childhood was filled with lessons from scripture, including close attention to Moses, the Old Testament prophets, and the “ultimate messenger,” Jesus of Nazareth. He developed a vivid sense of God’s “plan” for humankind and the conflicts it entailed.
At age 20, Wilson wrote an essay on “Christ’s Army,” describing an apocalyptic spiritual war, followed by an age of peace. God’s people, he held, faced off against followers of “the Prince of Lies.” These foes “meet upon the great battlefield of everyday” living. Importantly, in this struggle over life and salvation, “there is no middle course, no neutrality.” It would be “providential leaders” imbued with biblical truth and understanding God’s plan who would then claim victory and help usher in the reign of righteousness.
Wilson gained a deep attachment to the concept of Covenant as emphasized by his Calvinist and Presbyterian faith. As historian Malcolm Magee summarizes, this was not simply a synonym for “treaty.” Rather, for Wilson it meant the “full Old and New Testament meaning of nations… accepting divine order in return for divine blessings.” The Christian politician, drawing on biblical faith, then acted in “anticipation of the coming of a covenantal international world order.”
These biblical understandings carried into the Great War. In his address to Congress on April 2, 1917, asking for a Declaration of War against Germany, Wilson cast the conflict as bearing cosmic meaning. It was not just about German violations of neutral shipping rights. Rather, in an echo of his youthful essay, it was now a fight for “the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples.” In a subsequent address, he described this conflict as “the culminating and final war for human liberty,” where chaos would give way to divine order.
Alas, the making of peace in Versailles, France, one-hundred years ago proved to be a tragic failure.
Great Britain, France, and Italy refused to accede to Wilson’s call for a “peace without victors,” demanding that the Germans be punished. He was forced into many compromises. Sorting out nationalities also proved to be vastly more difficult than he had assumed.
Wilson proved unable to win support from the U.S. Senate for either the subsequent Versailles treaty or the League. Within 15 years, Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party would come to power in Germany, soon plunging Europe into a second and bloodier World War.
Some historians place blame for this failure in large part on Wilson, himself. His grandiose ideals, they say, prevented a more realistic peace from being constructed.  
It is true that Wilson overestimated his ability to serve as a divine, providential messenger to a war-torn continent. However, in retrospect, his peace plan would have treated an emerging democratic Germany as a partner, rather than as a defeated enemy and events would have followed a much better course.
The only other option with a prospect for success would have been a much more punitive “Versailles” treaty, crippling Germany economically and technologically as well as militarily.
Wilson's vision was sound: a world freed from imperialist adventures (implicitly including American ones); self-determination and democratic rule as could best be achieved, with respect for minority rights; and the building of a true covenantal world order, resting on common morality and pursuing justice and peace.
Is it possible that Wilson's ideals, once free of illusions, have a place in foreign affairs today?

Nor is it Russia’s influence in U.S. elections or China’s rise as a superpower. Instead, It’s political polarization, according to a new survey of nearly 600 foreign policy opinion leaders by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the Texas National Security Network.
In the weeks preceding the midterm elections, a period in which news coverage of a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the movement of Central American migrant caravans, and Brett Kavanaugh
’s Supreme Court nomination sharpened national divisions, nearly three-in-four foreign policy opinion leaders rated political polarization as a critical threat to U.S. national security.
Not only was partisanship viewed as the highest threat overall, but it was also consistently high among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, making it nearly unique among the threats assessed in the survey. On the danger partisanship poses to the United States, at least, there is a bipartisan consensus.
Yet there is a great deal of daylight between Republicans and Democrats on other possible threats. For example, Republican opinion leaders are much more likely than Democratic or Independent leaders to consider Iran’s nuclear program and the rise of China a critical threat. Democrats are much more likely to view Russian influence in US elections and the decline of democracy around the world as critical threats.
While several GOP political ads played up the dangers of immigrants crossing US borders, relatively few among even GOP experts consider immigration a critical threat.
North Korea’s nuclear program is the only threat other than partisanship to earn notable levels of concern across political affiliation.
The leadership survey was conducted between August 2 and October 16, 2018 among 588 foreign policy opinion leaders from executive branch agencies, Congress, think tanks, academia, the media, interest groups, business leaders, religious groups, and NGOs. These particular groupings of opinion leaders were weighted to match the weights applied to previous Chicago Council opinion leader surveys going back to 1974.
Some of President Trump
’s bold foreign policy actions, such as withdrawing the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iranian nuclear deal, also elicit polarized reactions across party lines. Nearly all Democratic opinion leaders support U.S. participation in both agreements (99 percent for the Paris agreement, 100 percent for the Iran deal) as do a majority of Independent leaders (86 percent Paris agreement, 74 percent Iran deal).  By contrast, only minorities of Republican opinion leaders favor these accords (36 percent for the Paris agreement, 46 percent for the Iran deal). That said, John Bolton
, Trump’s fiercely unilateralist national security advisor, might recoil at the finding that more than a third of Republican foreign policy elites support U.S. participation in these agreements.
While political polarization is a top threat for leaders, it is a lesser, but still substantial, concern for the American public. A July 12-31, 2018 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey of the US public found that 50 percent of Americans consider political polarization a critical threat, behind only international terrorism (66 percent), and North Korean (59 percent) and Iranian (52 percent) nuclear programs.
Americans’ concern about polarization is more acute among self-identified Democrats (57 percent) and Independents (50 percent) than Republicans (41 percent).
The comparatively greater sense of alarm among foreign policy leaders versus the public about the threat presented by polarization may reflect leaders’ greater awareness of how polarization is eroding America’s international standing and weakening its ability to address various global challenges.
As with substance abuse and other addictions, identifying the problem is the first step toward remedying it.
The good news is that foreign policy leaders and much of the public express deep concern about rising polarization. As the United States moves on from a highly divisive election, the key challenge facing Americans is to go beyond giving lip service to the problem. This will require rewarding leaders who engage in civil discourse and seek to work across the aisle, rather than employing hateful rhetoric and partisan attacks that sharpen political divisions.

This had many on the left up in arms and promising reform. A group of 100 Democratic candidates signed a pledge promising new limits on campaign spending by “big donors” and “special interests” if elected. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, the new darling of the left, went even further. She called for a constitutional amendment to restrict the First Amendment and counteract the 2010 Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. the Federal Election Commission, which allowed large political action committees known as super PACs to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on independent political speech.
Ocasio Cortez is in many ways a fringe candidate, but Democrats of all stripes share her animus against Citizens United and super PACs. In fact, both Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders
promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who would overturn Citizens United if elected. The obsession by people on the left with clearing the airwaves of campaign advertisements funded by super PACs is misguided. Super PACs are simply associations of individuals who think alike and want to engage in political speech independent of candidates and political parties.
Those seeking to quash them ignore the clear connection between the freedom of speech and the freedom to reach an audience, which in the modern media world costs money. This also rests on the misguided assumption that political speech funded by one set of corporations and individuals (the ones who donate to super PACs) is perverse while political speech funded by another set of corporations and individuals (the ones who own television stations and newspapers) is fine.
The dichotomy is obviously synthetic. Why should a puff piece on Beto O’Rourke in the Washington Post, owned by Amazon chief executive officer Jeff Bezos, be considered journalism, so no campaign finance rules apply, while a television spot praising Ted Cruz
paid for by Texans Are, a super PAC funded by Cinemark chief executive officer Lee Roy Mitchell, is deemed an electioneering communication subject to federal law?
Why should an interview of Ocasio Cortez, elected to represent the 14th District of New York, on MSNBC, owned by Comcast and General Electric, be treated differently than a commercial run by the Congressional Leadership Fund, partially funded by AT&T and Microsoft, in support of John Faso
, who lost in his race for the 19th District of New York?
If super PACs were eliminated, nothing would stop wealthy individuals and companies and from following Amazon and Comcast and buying their own media outlets. They could even start their own. Instead of Club for Growth Action, we could have Club for Growth News. Instead of the National Association of Realtors Fund, we could have the Realtor Times.
As law professors Samuel Issacharoff and Pamela Karlan wrote, it does not take someone like Albert Einstein to discern a “first law of political thermodynamics” that the “desire for political power cannot be destroyed” but rather at most channeled into different forms. Indeed, this law has been at work since the beginning of campaign finance reform.
When Congress banned labor union contributions in the 1940s, the AFLCIO found a clever workaround. It created an electioneering fund, which was the original political action committee, to which members could contribute. Since money from this fund was not coming directly from the union coffers, it could be freely donated to candidates.
Similarly, when Congress capped campaign contributions to political parties for the advocacy of its candidates, national committees began collecting millions in “soft money” not expressly earmarked for the advocacy of their candidates. When Congress closed the soft money loophole in 2002, national committees took a different route and now direct wealthy donors to give to local and state committees since there are no limits on the amount one committee can transfer to another.
If history is any guide, as wealthy individuals and corporations funnel money into news stations rather than super PACs, it will ignite another round of the arms race between regulators and regulated. The Federal Election Commission would surely take it upon itself to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate news sources, and between real and fake news. In other words, it would essentially become a censor.
This is no Orwellian fever dream. The federal government was once in the business of making such distinctions. In the days of over the airwaves broadcasting, the Federal Communications Commission required, as a condition of holding a license that networks present both sides of a policy issue in an “honest” and “balanced” manner. This was known as the “fairness doctrine” and many on the left support its return to this day.
Of course, the “fairness doctrine” did not live up to its billing. Instead, regulators gave their imprimatur to the center left commentary that monopolizes the major networks. This overwhelming airtime superiority allowed liberals to carpet bomb Republicans off Capitol Hill and keep all but the conciliatory Dwight Eisenhower, the shrewd Richard Nixon, and the most rhetorically brilliant Ronald Reagan out of the White House.
It is here that the connection between free speech, political spending, and our form of government comes into sharp focus. The root assumption that animates all campaign finance reform is that some messengers are altruistic and honest while others are pernicious and false. Liberals put themselves in the former category and their opposition in the latter. The Founders understood that by enshrining the right to free speech in our democracy, they also assured open political contestation in our elections.

0,11/08/18 04:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/415779-house-democrats-have-power-to-stop-mass-shootings-in-america,House Democrats have power to stop mass shootings in America,"We have awakened to the tragedy of another mass shooting in our nation. Once again, we watch bleary eyed the television scenes of interviews in front of flashing lights, crime scene tape, tactical police vehicles, another war scene. Once again, it is mourning in America. The question now is will the midterm elections this week matter on the issue of gun safety?
Two years ago, a shooting at an Orlando nightclub inspired powerless Democrats in the House minority not to their feet but to their seats. Led by Representatives John Lewis
, Katherine Clark
, and Robin Kelly
, they staged a daylong sit in on the House floor to protest the refusal of Republicans to hold a vote on gun safety legislation. They chanted, tweeted, and prayed in an unprecedented organized disruption of House proceedings.
Republicans responded. They protected the sanctity of the House with “tough on incivility” rules against future disruptions, including fines ranging from $500 to $2,500. However, Republicans did nothing to protect the safety of our schools, theaters, synagogues, restaurants, nightclubs, or the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, the scene of the latest mass shooting where 12 people were slaughtered overnight.
That is on top of the 195 people who have been killed in mass shootings since Orlando. Back in 2016, House Democrats had to resort to civil disobedience. They had no gavel, no power, no leverage. That will change in January. These midterm elections give me hope, not just because Democrats will have a majority, but because many districts that expanded the majority have voters who support common sense gun safety.
These midterm elections marked a significant realignment of urban and suburban districts supporting Democrats. In moderate counties, a representative who supports measures like stronger background checks or the bipartisan “no fly, no buy” legislation, which would make it more difficult for people who cannot board planes to buy military style assault weapons, simply reflects the common sense of his or her constituents.
The difference will be that Democrats in charge of the House will actually be able to pass that and other bills. Sure, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
will likely squash the measures in the Senate. But he has a complication in 2020, when the battlefield tilts back to Democrats, with 20 Republican seats and only 11 Democratic seats to be contested.
That includes Senate Republicans in trending blue states like Iowa, Maine, Colorado, and North Carolina, where House Democrats picked up seats this week. If Senate Republicans block popular measures like stronger background checks or better safeguards against bullets that kill cops, they will stand along with the gun lobby and lose support of voters.
It would be nice if Senate Republicans would vote based on your safety instead of their survival, but they will keep making political calculations. Now, however, the calculations are complicated by a unique constellation of circumstances. Democrats can send bills to the Senate, and blue state and purple state Republicans will have a harder time opposing them.
House Democrats are in a position to do something. This is in their hands because Americans put something else in their hands. That is a gavel.

0,11/08/18 12:30 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/415698-partisan-rancor-undermines-our-ability-to-act-on-china,Partisan rancor undermines our ability to act on China,"Americans, facing levels of acrimonious polarization not seen since the Civil War, may understandably worry about the health of the country’s democratic institutions.
However, the consequences of partisan rancor may also stretch beyond domestic politics. Already, some experts warn that “political dysfunction” is becoming a national security concern.
For America’s strategic competition with China, its most formidable rival since the Cold War, political polarization potentially carries three significant implications:
First, bipartisan consensus on China’s challenge offers an important, albeit fragile, basis for unified action. Second, a sharply partisan environment exacerbates America’s tensions with China, raising the risk of a crisis. Third, ironically, intense partisanship also raises the risk of decision-making paralysis should a crisis erupt. 
In a political environment in which America’s two parties agree on very little, the challenge posed by China enjoys surprisingly broad bipartisan support. A Pew poll showed a relatively narrow partisan gap on the issue of China compared to other issues, with similar trends in both parties over time.
Democrats may disagree on trade tactics, but they largely agree with President Trump
’s efforts to step up pressure on China across a broad range of issues.
This year’s National Defense Authorization Act, for example, passed with broad bipartisan support and involved numerous policies to counter Chinese espionage, influence and military power.
Under President Trump, the United States passed a $60 billion aid program aimed in part at countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative to integrate the Eurasian landmass. 
But unity on the challenge posed by China can do little to overcome deep fissures in American society. Political polarization has reached levels not seen in decades, with nearly one-third of people in each party describing the other party as a threat to the nation's well-being. Trust in all institutions, including media, government and business has fallen considerably.
Intense partisan feuding imposes a severe obstacle for national leaders who are seeking to enact strategically valuable, but politically contentious measures to compete with China.
Symptomatic of this difficulty, President Obama failed to overcome bipartisan opposition to enact the ambitious trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
President Trump has abandoned the TPP, but his provocative leadership style has demonstrated how striking an aggressive public stance toward China can mobilize public opinion and bipartisan support for other politically controversial policies, such as restrictions on trade and access to U.S. technology.
Actions such as labeling China a “strategic competitor” in the 2017 National Security Strategy and high-profile speeches by top leaders lambasting Beijing’s policies have helped fuel rising public antipathy toward China.
Polls suggest over 55 percent of Americans now view China negatively, a notable shift from previous years, when China’s unfavorability remained below 50 percent for most of President Obama’s tenure.
A trade-off for U.S. leaders appears increasingly unavoidable between stable ties with China that come at the cost of a constrained ability to enact competitive policies on the one hand; and fewer constraints on the implementation of competitive policies that risk antagonistic, unstable bilateral ties on the other. 
Mobilizing public opinion against China may ease the passage of contentious policies, but they carry their own risks. As strains deepen and mutually hostile rhetoric intensifies, the risks of a military crisis may be increasing.
Close encounters between military platforms between China and the United States have occurred before, but the hostile political atmosphere raises the danger of miscalculation in incidents like the near collision of a Chinese warship with the U.S.S. Decatur in late September.
Moreover, while the risks of a crisis may be increasing, the effects of polarization could impair rapid and bold decision-making in the event of a crisis. The politicization of foreign policy developments means politics no longer stops at “water’s edge.”
Bipartisan cooperation may be achievable in peacetime when risks are low, but the fragile basis of bipartisan support carries an inherent danger of rupture in a crisis if one partisan side exploits controversial foreign policy actions for political advantage against the other — a dynamic well exhibited in the intense partisan rancor over the Iraq War and the U.S. 2011 intervention in Libya.
U.S. leaders thus could face cross-cutting political and strategic incentives for action in a crisis, raising the risk of decision-making paralysis. 
To address these vulnerabilities, national leaders could work harder to engage both domestic audiences and international allies and partners. Greater efforts to mobilize support and educate domestic constituents could help ease passage of strategically valuable, but politically sensitive, measures like regional trade pacts.
One need not agree with either President Trump’s rhetoric or his specific policies to recognize his achievements in raising popular awareness of the stakes of the broader strategic competition with China.
Similarly, closer cooperation with U.S. allies and partners may also facilitate U.S. efforts to strengthen its strategic position internationally. In July, the United States, Japan and Australia agreed on a plan to invest in countries across the Asia-Pacific to counter China’s growing regional clout.
Stronger international cooperation could also help deter Chinese brinkmanship. Beijing’s mulling of a possible provocation to test U.S. resolve becomes far more risky when other countries may be involved.
An encouraging development on this front involves the “Five Eyes” alliance including Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, which has expanded a coalition for intelligence sharing purposes with Japan and Germany.
In coming years, U.S. leaders will need to work even harder to mitigate the effects of political polarization and manage competition with China in a stable, effective manner.

We won districts that we didn’t even think were competitive. Champagne bottles were uncorked, optimism was wild, and hopes were high. But that isn’t yesterday’s news. That was 2006’s news, which was the last midterm election that Democrats won.
Four years after that, we lost it all. Some people bring funeral crepe to a celebration. For those who exalt in the extraordinary success of the Democrats in winning the House majority this time, a note of sobriety: The party needs to avoid repeating that earlier outcome. Here are the top five ways Democrats can turn this victory into more success.
Play the political long game
Democrats shouldn’t play for the next two years, they should play for the next 12 years. The catastrophic mistake we made in the last cycle of success was taking our eye off of state and local elections, particularly relating to redistricting. We thumped our chests on the inaugural platform in 2008, and then Republicans wiped us out in state capitals in 2010 and took control of redistricting. This noxious midterm environment for Republicans could have cost them as many as 60 seats, had they not thought ahead and built a successful redistricting firewall in 2012. Democrats simply can’t afford to make that same mistake twice.
Do a deal on infrastructure
While the economy has recovered and is doing well under this administration, there’s still anxiety about its fundamentals. One of the smartest things to sustainably increase people’s earnings is to build again. Every $1 billion that we invest in infrastructure returns $6 billion to the economy and creates tens of thousands of well paying jobs.
There’s a smart political angle here. Remember when Republicans tried to shut down the government last September? President Trump
had a brief love fest with “Chuck and Nancy.” It’s time to rekindle the romance. House Democrats should propose a major infrastructure investment with Senate Democrats and bring it gift wrapped to President Trump. If he truly likes a good real estate deal that includes roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports, he’ll take it. That would leave Senate Republicans isolated and create an interesting Mitch McConnell
family dynamic, since the other half of that power couple, Elaine Chao
, is secretary of transportation.
Cut prescription drug prices
President Trump emptily promised to lower the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs, and Democrats can help him achieve that with their edge on health care. Again, Senate Republicans might balk, but with 20 Republican seats up for reelection in 2020, they’ll balk at their own risk.
Deliver to millennial voters
This midterm election reportedly turned out a significant increase in young voters. Now, the task for Democrats is to keep them engaged. They should pass college affordability initiatives, along with measures that tap into the realities of the modern economy, such as technology, career mobility, starting families later, and incentivizing entrepreneurship.
Resist the impeachment itch
Democrats won this majority in districts where voters talked about everyday issues like Medicare, not Robert Mueller
. If there are crimes that truly rise to the level of impeachable offenses, then go for it. But it’s far more important for lawmakers in power to deliver meaningful gains to American households than multiple subpoenas to the White House.
There are other initiatives and ideas that will require consensus by House Democrats, including strengthened background checks for guns and sweeping ethics reform. What I hope will guide my former colleagues is the realization that they won the majority in purple districts and will retain it by reelecting moderate members in those suburban swing districts.
Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and his team did a masterful job of managing the midterm environment by recruiting early, expanding the battlefield, and guiding candidates to fundraise to neutralize big campaign finance assaults.
But now the politics has ended and the governing begins. In a volatile environment with an erratic President Trump, it won’t be easy over the next two years. By sticking to the fundamentals and delivering for voters in places like Kansas, Georgia, and South Carolina, it will be easier.

0,11/07/18 07:30 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/415422-victimhood-culture-and-traditional-justice-are-on-a-collision-course,Victimhood culture and traditional justice are on a collision course,"“I just want to say to the men in this country, just shut up and step up.” Responding to Brett Kavanaugh
’s hearing for his nomination to the Supreme Court, Sen. Mazie Hirono
(D-Hawaii) put American men on notice: Their day was over. The mainstream press and social media were more specific in echoing who needed to shut up: old white men in government. According to social justice, the proper role for this privileged group is to mutely support victimized ones. Presumably, they could also step aside.    
Congress has a culture war on its hands and the battles will blaze for the foreseeable future. Congress is a microcosm of the schism that is tearing America apart--ideologically, morally and emotionally.
Understanding the dynamics of the conflict requires a grasp of the “victimhood culture” that Hirono’s statement epitomized in its message and its tone. The message of this #MeToo approach is “get out of the way of oppressed groups”; the tone is rage. 
A key to understanding the victimhood ideology is how it defines “justice.”   
Identity justice
Victimhood is an integral part of identity politics and the social justice movement of past decades. People are separated into categories according to their secondary characteristics, such as gender or race. (Their primary characteristic is being human). A person’s political status is then viewed through the lens of his or her group identity, with heavy emphasis placed upon whether the group is considered to be oppressed or oppressive. Men oppress women, for instance. The purpose of social justice is to balance the status of all groups, which requires an imbalance of treatment because some groups are seemingly privileged at the expense of others. 
Social justice is identity justice applied to groups. This runs counter to the ideal of traditional Western justice that seeks to erase secondary characteristics from how the law treats individuals. Ideally, it does not matter if someone is white or black, male or female. The same legal principles and practices, such as the presumption of innocence, are applied equally to every human being. Western justice is individual justice for all. 
Ideals are rarely manifested in pure form. Law enforcement does not always handle a black person with the same respect as it does a white one, for example. When this happens, the situation needs to be rectified. One way is to remove the cause of discrimination against blacks, which could mean reforming aspects of the system or removing specific personnel. The goal is equal justice for all, which is achieved by treating everyone as an individual to be judged on the merits of evidence and according to concepts encompassed by the words, “due process.”
To the victimhood culture, however, Western justice is a creation of white privilege and it cannot deliver fairness to oppressed groups. Indeed, the ideals and structure of Western law are an obstacle to social justice. Old legal and political principles must be either discarded or redefined. 
The redefinition toward social justice has been active in Congress for some while; it has also been actively resisted — a trend that is likely to accelerate. The recasting of justice includes:
Expanding the scope of punishable offenses. The version of the Violence Against Women Act that is up for reauthorization expands the definition of domestic violence (DV) to include non-violent and common behavior, such as persistently telephoning an ex-partner after a break-up. This broadening is to the legal advantage of alleged DV victims, who are usually viewed as women, at the expense of alleged DV perpetrators, who are usually viewed as men.
Reducing due process. #Believewomen was a mantra of activists during the Kavanaugh hearings and it is an increasingly common sentiment expressed in Congress. In response to a question about Roy Moore
whose aspirations for senatorhood were scuttled by accusations of sexual abuse, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) said, “I believe the women.” Immediately believing an accusation is the opposite of due process, however, which demands evidence and presumes innocence. 
Creating incentives for false accusations by not punishing them. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley
(R-Iowa) recently commented on a ""fabricated allegation"" against Kavanaugh. Grassley contended that the accuser “just wanted to get attention.” Political motives may have been in play, as well. Normally, such allegations go unpunished, which allows false accusers to achieve their goals, without paying a legal price. In this case, however, Grassley asked the Department of Justice to investigate.   
The victimhood culture and traditional justice are on a collision course.  
The victimhood culture draws upon the natural compassion that people feel for those who are treated unfairly. Compassion is one of the best qualities within human beings and society; it should not be politically abused. The culture also elicits support by pointing to the make-up of institutions, such as Congress. On its surface, at least, Congress does not seem to represent the American demographic. But the solution should not be to demonize a category of people or to abandon traditional standards of justice.
The victimhood culture has used people’s compassion and sense of fairness to restructure the principles of justice that protect individuals against government overreach and false accusations. Traditional justice is a defining aspect of Western civilization. The incivility that now haunts society reflects the breakdown of such institutions. Without justice for all, there is violence.

Ferrer, 48, stepped down as chairman of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) in October, citing health concerns.
Héctor Enrique Ferrer Santiago, Ferrer's oldest son, announced his father's death at a San Juan hospital Monday. 
Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, a member of the ruling New Progressive Party (PNP), on Monday called for a five-day islandwide mourning period to remember Ferrer.
""Today I receive the sad news of the physical departure not of a political opponent, but of a friend. In spite of our different visions, Hector was always available for dialogue, to build bridges, to seek out consensus for the good of the island. Today I elevate my prayers for his eternal rest,"" Rosselló said in a statement.
Ferrer was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 2015 and, despite the disease, mounted a return to politics after having retired to private life in 2012.
In 2016, he ran for resident commissioner of Puerto Rico — the territory's nonvoting delegate in Congress — but lost to current Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón (R), a member of the PNP.
The following year, Ferrer was elected as chairman of the PPD.
Aside from leading the left-wing pro-commonwealth party, Ferrer was also a well-known athlete.
He attended the University of North Carolina on a baseball scholarship and later played in the minor leagues in Puerto Rico.
Ferrer is survived by two sons and a daughter."

Many of them had become energized about Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as he ran against Hillary Clinton
in the Democratic primary. With his outsider’s message, Sanders ran — and railed — against the Big Banks, Big Pharma, Big Corporations, and Big Brother. And, of course, a promise of making college education free.
Of course, things didn’t turn out for these young Sanders supporters as they had hoped.
After the Russian hacking and the WikiLeaks dumping of the Podesta and Democratic National Committee emails, many of Sanders’ supporters angrily turned against both Clinton and the Democratic establishment in Philadelphia. Despite the focus on Clinton as the first female presidential nominee of a major party, many young Sanders supporters did not turn up to vote in 2016 election and 1 in 10 even voted for Donald Trump.
And remember earlier in the year when the teens of Parkland were going to be the driving force of the election? Back in February, it seemed that the issue of guns was going to be a top issue in the 2018 Midterms. From Las Vegas to Parkland (and now Pittsburgh), many Americans could not stop talking about guns. And the Parkland teens were everywhere. From being on the cover of Time magazine to poignant interviews on TV with both the teens themselves alongside grieving parents, these youth were going to lead the way.
While they were able to make real change in their home state when the Florida Legislature passed several gun measures that were signed by Gov. Rick Scott, the Parkland Teens’ moment soon passed, and the energy they brought to young adults soon fizzled along with their media attention.
Historically, the power that young people played in the 1960s Civil Rights and Anti-War movements led to lasting change in the United States. Today, there are as many Millennials as Baby Boomers, and both can claim the title of the nation’s biggest voting bloc. Young people have always been able to make a difference in America when they become engaged.
So why don’t they now?
Turn on any cable news channel over the past two years and you can see pundits on the Left decry Donald Trump
and the GOP, and those on the Right decry the Democrats and Robert Mueller
. On TV it appears that both sides are enraged — and engaged. Nov. 6 is being dubbed (on both sides of the aisle) “The Most Important Midterm Election of our Lifetime.” And while some young adults are getting active in select campaigns around the country (e.g., Beto O’Rourke in Texas), it remains to be seen if young adults will actually show up to vote. Historically, young adults tend to vote at very low levels in midterm elections.
When I speak to my students, it sometimes shocks me that so many of them show a lack of enthusiasm for anything political. The recent Washington Post story that looked at non-voters in Tennessee’s Montgomery County had a subtext of “Can you believe these apolitical individuals?” — but they could just as easily be anywhere.
Like the rest of us, young adults tend to be engaged when the candidates speak about issues they care about. We know many young adults care about the environment, racial equality, support gay and transgender rights, face a mountain of college debt, and worry that the gig economy is their future. It’s hard enough to have a side hustle as a college student, but having that full time is not an appealing future for this generation. Neither is driving Uber.
When young adults once again don’t turn out in heavy numbers to vote there will be the usual hand wringing and wondering what it takes to get them to the polls. But when the midterm elections are framed as being about crime, immigration, the caravan, and Kavanaugh, where are the issues to motivate them?
Many of these young adults are just like the rest of us. Take a walk around campus and peer into the lounges, nooks, and crannies where college students relax between classes. In my department, cable news plays all day on a flat-screen TV hanging on the wall. Few take any notice. They are looking down — at their phones playing a game, on their laptop watching Netflix. The same things many of us do when we are bored or want to disengage from the world.
Frankly, can you blame them?

While the fire sea urchin is poisonous and feared, the red urchin crab has learned to carry it on its back. The crab uses the urchin as a weapon while the urchin uses the crab to move freely in new feeding grounds. Washington has its own strange forms of symbiotic relationship and one became evident in two separate interviews by the president of the United States and the president of CNN.
Both effectively admitted that they needed each other. Donald Trump needs the media as a weapon and the media needs Donald Trump to sustain itself. It was a rare moment of honesty in Washington that was lost in the crush of the tragic news of the Pittsburgh shootings and the Florida pipe bomber. The comments of President Trump
and Jeff Zucker vividly confirmed the strange symbiosis between Trump and his media critics.
Trump has been an anomaly in politics long before his campaign. He has been regularly denounced for false statements. Yet he is also one of the most transparent politicians of his generation, often acknowledging agendas or desires that most politicians conceal. Where Hillary Clinton
seemed incapable of being open and honest, even when it would have worked to her advantage, Trump will compulsively blurt out the worst possible admissions even when no one is pressing him on them. Examples range from his disastrous interview with NBC anchor Lester Holt on his thinking on the Russia investigation when firing FBI director James Comey
or his statements on the travel ban on Muslim majority countries.
Last week, however, was the ultimate example of a man who likes to play poker with the cards facing outward. Trump told Axios that his overheated attacks on the media as the “enemy of the people” are meant to fire up his base. Trump said, “I couldn’t be here if I didn’t do that.” When asked to stop the attacks, Trump said that he commonly replies, “Hey, I’m here! It got me here.” He added, “I know what I do good and what I do bad. I really get it, okay? I really get it better than anybody in the whole world.”
Moreover, Trump noted that it is “much easier” for him to be nice than it is to be the way he has to be to maintain loyalty from his base. The “way he has to be” appears to endlessly demonizing the mainstream media even when such attacks can easily cross the line into a dangerous form of demagoguery. Such verbal attacks can move a crazed individual like Cesar Sayoc from rage to response in fighting the “fake news” enemy.
The media has shown an equal absence of awareness. Networks like CNN constantly seem to be offer counterpoints rather than coverage, taking the most critical take on every word Trump utters. While Trump gives ample opportunity for negative coverage, many CNN hosts and reporters have abandoned any semblance of detached neutral analysis. The reason was made evident in a recent interview by the network president.
When asked why CNN now seems to report only on Trump and his every move, Zucker had a surprising moment of clarity. It is all about the ratings. Zucker explained, “People say all the time, ‘Oh, I don’t want to talk about Trump, I’ve had too much Trump.’ We’ve seen that anytime you break away from the Trump story and cover other events in this era, the audience goes away. So we know that, right now, Donald Trump dominates.”
What is curious is that the tactics do not seem to be working that all well for Trump or CNN. Trump is looking at losing the House and narrowly holding the Senate despite one of the best economies in years. While his popularity has risen, Trump continues to roller coaster on favorability below a majority of voters. While his attacks on journalists have rallied supporters, it has riled a growing number of “anyone but Trump” voters, and pushed suburban moms and independents toward the Democrats.
At least Trump can claim favorability with his supporters and other conservatives. CNN has ridden its openly negative Trump coverage into the basement of ratings. In October, Fox News again beat both MSNBC and CNN in ratings and posted more viewers than both competitors combined. Fox News averaged 2.8 million to the less than 1.6 million viewers of MSNBC and 931,000 viewers of CNN. In basic cable overall, CNN finished ninth behind the Hallmark Channel and HGTV.
Missing from the remarks of both Trump and Zucker is any notion of the ethical obligations that transcend ratings. A United States president should be a champion of the free press, a defining institution under our Constitution. Likewise, a media president should recognize the duty to cover hard news and not just the most clickbaited subject. While CNN legitimately mocked Trump for bizarre meetings in the Oval Office with figures like Kanye West, it covered those meetings in detail and replayed them on a loop as wars and natural disasters went without mention.
The fact is that the president and the network need each other. CNN anchor Brian Stelter recently took offense when legendary journalist Ted Koppel noted that, despite the caustic comments, Trump has been good for CNN. Stelter responded, “That means what? If ratings are up, that means what?” Koppel did not back down and correctly stated, “The ratings are up. It means you can’t do without Donald Trump. You would be lost without Donald Trump.” When Stelter shot back, “Ted, you know that’s not true,” Koppel responded with the common view that “CNN’s ratings would be in the toilet without Donald Trump.” Stelter brought an angry retort and said, “You know that’s not true. You’re playing for laughs.”
Zucker basically said that same thing and confirmed that CNN is playing for ratings. Call it sensational symbiosis. Trump carries the media like a red urchin crab while CNN rides him as far as he can go. They both benefit by maintaining a level of anger while ignoring the obvious damage to both the presidency and the press. Both play to relatively narrow bandwidths of voters and viewers to achieve short lived returns. That is the thing with mutualism among symbiotic creatures. The benefits rarely extend beyond the two animals, while the costs can be great for those around them.

0,11/05/18 10:45 AM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/414882-young-voters-could-lift-democrats-to-victory,Young voters can lift Democrats to victory,"Across America, there is a new generation of young voters ready to teach their elders about the meaning of freedom and democracy.
Throughout the Democratic Party, there is a new generation of rising-star candidates for the Senate, House and governorships, ready to lead the party and nation into the future.
From the moment that the Parkland students galvanized young people across the nation, inspiring millions to march in cities across the country, there has been a movement that can change the course of America in the midterm elections.
These young people are the next great generation in American life, and they are rallying in force behind candidates like Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), running for the Senate in Texas, Georgia state Rep. Stacey Abrams (D), running for governor of Georgia, and Tallahassee, Fla. Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) running for governor of Florida.
Early voting has exploded to stratospheric heights, especially among young voters in the Texas Senate race. 
In the Washington Post Monday, there was a detailed story suggesting, based on data involving early voting and new voter registrations, that a growing wave of young voters is challenging the political status quo and will be voting in large numbers this Tuesday to change America and change the world.
Stacey Abrams is running one of the most inspirational campaigns in Georgia history. Andrew Gillum is campaigning with integrity and vigor to be the governor in Florida who represents all of the people.
Beto O’Rourke is running one of the most innovative and courageous campaigns in modern times, seeking to lift voters and enlarge the electorate. He has inspired massive campaign donations from small donors and huge new voter registration that will lift O’Rourke and every Democrat running for every office in the ""Lone Star State.""
Many of the huge number of newly registered voters across America who are young, black, Hispanic and female and have never voted before — and who are heavily inclined to vote this year for Democrats — are not being captured in public opinion polls. 
Young voters who are inspired this year are not the only constituency that is poised to make their voice heard in the midterms.
I marched with the women who came in January 2017 to Washington in the hundreds of thousands to demand they be safe from abuse and witnessed not only inspiring speeches but booths to register new voters.
I marched with supporters of fair immigration in June who came to Washington and stood in huge numbers. I not only witnessed passionate speeches decrying the demonization of Hispanic immigrants and injustice against the ""Dreamers"" but also witnessed booths to register new voters to make their voices heard in the midterm elections.
I marched with young people and their parents in March, who came to Washington in large numbers to demand that students be protected from school shootings.
There, I witnessed a 9-year-old girl — Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s granddaughter — bring hundreds of thousands of people to their feet with her call for young people to be the next great generation in American life — along with booths registering new voters whose dreams for America will be expressed in voting booths Tuesday.
In close elections that will occur in countless races across the country, the voices of young people could be the difference in realizing the dreams of many of the noblest people in America saying no to the siren song of hatred coming from the president's mouth.
Young people are the best of America. They are the hope of America. They are the future of America. They represent the goodness of America. They believe in the greatness of America. 
These young people could be the catalyst for change in the most important midterm elections in the history of America.

0,11/04/18 01:00 PM EST,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/414222-an-era-of-violence-at-the-doorstep-of-america,An era of violence at the doorstep of America,"America appears to be reaching a tipping point towards national crisis. The recent discovery of pipe bombs proves that identity politics has pushed some in society to the threshold. Belligerent rhetoric and resurging protests to mobilize supporters and confront the other side are escalating to dangerous levels. Such behavior foments an increasing disregard for respectful, peaceful dialogue, while America regresses into an era of civil unrest, political chaos and violence.
Over a decade ago, I returned from one of a few combat tours in the Middle East and Southwest Asia. I remember sitting in my parents’ home and telling my father, a Vietnam War veteran, that this country was simmering with political and ethnic cleavages. The anger from 9/11 and its effects among different races, genders, religions and creeds was not just limited to combat operations overseas. I saw and felt the same fervor in our communities, whether through casual conversations with people, family time at the dinner table, or in the media.
Identity politics has crept back into the mainstream and revitalized political, social, economic and racial divisions. Some believe this strife is nowhere near the past eras of discontent, such as the 1960s or 1850s, but in today’s digital world, it takes only one flashpoint. America’s history shows that violence and extremism emerge when leadership and moderation across the breadth and depth of issues fail, and opportunities for solutions disappear. This is when violence takes root in society and becomes hard to stop.
The United States stands at a point of grave concern because of polarization among Americans.  The American experience in democracy, however, has withstood challenging eras in the past, most of which were tied to racism or extreme identity politics. But the current environment presents a foreboding challenge. The erosion of trust in the government, its institutions and leaders, added to the polarization, gives rise to a recipe for violence. Such violence originates out of fear and desire to control outcomes, because people see the government failing to deliver solutions with respect to their views.
All three branches of government and the media have contributed to the state of affairs. The executive branch challenges political norms with rhetoric that focuses on identity politics and their political base. Congress and former administration leaders direct their supporters to harass political opponents, or tell their party members to go low and “take them out the knees.” The Supreme Court nomination process became extraordinarily partisan at the expense of people’s well-being. The media have a penchant for exploiting a market space for partisan politics, which results in shaping news for voters versus voters being shaped by news. And we must not forget the American citizen who bears the responsibility to behave within the laws and norms of society as a peaceful member of the community.  
Today, our own citizens attack each other with mass shootings at schools, nightclubs and congressional baseball games; mail pipe bombs and other biological threats; physically assault each other on campuses and at protests; ambush and kill first-responders; and engage in many other malicious physical and emotional assaults, including through media. It is a vicious cycle that no one seems to be able to control. If violence is the common thread to deal with polarization and lack of trust in American institutions, then leadership must be the way to repair this unraveling.
It starts with setting the tone that no decision is deliberately meant to hurt another group of people. Americans respect decisions that remain within the values of the Constitution. Decisions never should be taken from a win-lose perspective, unless the nation is at war based on the survival of its values. Win-lose approaches, outside of war, only polarize identity politics further, which, if not led with moderation and maturity, likely will lead to violence.  
Leaders seem to focus on problems, not solutions. This perspective lends itself to construing compromise as a weakness, which simply enables the other party to challenge more at the negotiating table. This tactic is inherently flawed, because the focus is not on finding solutions. As a result, the approach leads to a win-lose methodology and further polarization. The time has come for leaders to find solutions and repair relationships damaged by polarizing politics.
The Nov. 6 midterm elections, regardless of the outcome, indicate a deepening retrenchment of identity politics. Negotiating solutions to American society’s many long-neglected, deep-rooted issues is a daunting task. Hardening alliances, bellicosity in all directions and changing versions of “the truth” exploit these conditions. Unfortunately, our leadership is allowing moderation and positive solutions to take a back seat to political gain.
The United States must begin reconciliation. The current polarization goes back a few decades and is not the fault of just one administration. Democracy is messy, but dignity and respect should be enduring in both word and deed. And, trust has no identity; it applies to all Americans. Failure to bring about an attitude that builds trust, and sustains dignity and respect, risks condemning American society to an era of violence. This leadership responsibility rests on the doorstep of this generation of leaders and the current government.

0,11/03/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/414697-spirit-of-political-reform-is-true-bipartisan-force-in-the-election,Spirit of political reform is true bipartisan force in the election,"Americans will go to the polls next week in one of the most important and rancorous midterm elections in memory, one infused with partisan anger over the recent confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court justice, further stoked by fears of an immigrant invasion and the tragedy of recent domestic terrorism. The tribal bases of the political parties are clashing along the seams of a deeply divided nation. In their respective echo chambers, both sides describe the stakes in nearly existential terms.
Yet there is a parallel midterm election underway that is driven not by cultural fear and partisan loathing, but rather by a bipartisan spirit of reform and national renewal. That campaign is being fought at the grassroots level. This hard fought contest pits the defenders of the uncivil and cynical status quo against reformers looking to change the incentive system that rewards politicians for pandering to the most extreme voters. Though rarely mentioned in media campaign coverage, this parallel midterm election and the very real possibility of a political “reform wave” may have the more profound and lasting impact on our democracy.
As part of the Commission on Civility and Effective Governance of the Center for the Study of the Presidency, we have tracked the grassroots efforts to reform our politics. The signs are unmistakable. There are campaign and election reform initiatives on the ballot in more than two dozen states and localities. Many would end the partisan gerrymandering that allows politicians to choose their voters, rather than the other way around, fueling the notion of a rigged system.
This is one remedy to address the vast majority of seats in the House of Representatives that are drawn specifically to reduce competition and result in increased polarization. Other reforms would establish open primary elections to limit the disproportionate power of extreme partisans in low turnout and closed primaries that disenfranchise political independents. Still others would impose much stricter ethics laws on politicians to reduce the outsized influence of money in politics.
Many of these reforms are building on past successes. California moved to a system that sends the top two vote getters in the primary to the general election regardless of party affiliation, breaking the Republican and Democratic “duopoly” of closed primaries in the state. Maine voters chose to become the first to use a ranked choice system statewide, where voters mark candidates by order of preference and can support their favorite candidates without worrying about the “spoiler” effect.
With the support of Republican Governor John Kasich, Ohio voters this year overwhelmingly chose to reform the state redistricting process to counter one of the most gerrymandered maps in the nation. Colorado also looks likely to pass redistricting reform with the support of Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper. The midterm ballots in Michigan, Missouri, and Utah will also include initiatives to counter gerrymandering. Major ethics reform measures could be approved by voters in North Dakota, South Dakota, and New Mexico next week. In total, tens of millions of American voters will have weighed in on reform measures this year.
Josh Silver, cofounder of Represent Us, a national organization trying to change the incentives in our increasingly dysfunctional politics, said in a recent interview, “I started Represent Us because polarization, gridlock, and corruption have increasingly come to define American politics. That is not a coincidence, but rather the direct result of failed campaign and election policies. That makes reforming those policies and fixing the system the quintessential public policy issue of our time.”
Represent Us supports grassroots efforts in states and helps them carry the reform issue successfully onto the national stage. “Along the way we are discovering that reforming what is widely perceived as a rigged system is popular with a majority of both Democrats and Republicans. That explains why we have seen an unprecedented number of reform efforts really catch fire all across the country,” Silver added.
Predictably, those reform initiatives have provoked a fierce backlash by powerbrokers and stakeholders in the current system. In Michigan, establishment interests banded together to oppose a gerrymandering reform measure that was placed on the midterm ballot next week with 425,000 signatures. Oil and gas interests and the chamber of commerce in North Dakota are fighting a ballot initiative to create an ethics commission and require full disclosure of campaign contributions.
Nowhere were the retrograde forces more brazen than in Maine, which passed its ranked choice voting initiative by referendum in 2017, only to see the Republican governor and legislature, backed by a number of Democratic state lawmakers, repeal the initiative literally in the dead of night. Reformers worked through a cold winter to collect the signatures needed to resuscitate the initiative, which passed again this year.
“From the moment ranked choice originally passed, the political class in Maine did everything in its power to smother it,” said Cara Brown McCormick, who helped manage both successful campaigns to pass the initiative in the state. “But the people of Maine rose up and reclaimed the sovereign power the state constitution gives them to decide how to choose their leaders. We like to say that ranked choice voting lets you vote your hopes, and not your fears. For candidates it means you do not have to divide people to win. You have to bring them together.”
Imagine American politics inspired by hope rather than fear, and elected officials rewarded for uniting rather than dividing the nation. These are the stakes at play in the important parallel midterm election next week.

I stand with my Jewish brothers and sisters. All forms of violence are wrong and I condemn them in the strongest terms. To attack anyone in a place of worship is one of the most cowardly acts I can imagine, and the person responsible should be punished to the fullest extent allowed by law.
Much of the resulting news commentary has focused on the state of our political discourse and on placing blame. To be sure, our country is bitterly divided and facing serious challenges in the midst of a midterm election that may affect the balance of power in Washington. But our nation has faced tough, if not more tumultuous, periods before.
We fought a bitter Civil War where thousands of Americans died, in large part, over the right to own slaves. The Great Depression crushed the financial hopes and dreams of countless families. I still remember the protests over the Vietnam War, the riots and shootings on college campuses, and the assassinations of political and civil rights leaders during the 1960s. The impeachment and resignation of Richard Nixon after Watergate was another dark chapter in our history.
We endured all of this and more because of the character, sacrifices, and spirit of the American people and because of strong leaders in our government. Yes, we are a diverse nation, but we share common values of hard work, freedom, and opportunity. In the past, our leaders were statesmen who cared far more about the next generation than about the next election. Power is intoxicating. I know it. I have felt its pull. We need our leaders to step up and set an example of courage to do the right thing for our country even when it means sacrificing political power.
Some of the public commentary has questioned whether the rhetoric of the president is at least partly responsible for the recent killings and bomb threats. He, of course, bears no direct responsibility for the criminal acts of others. He did not squeeze the trigger in Pittsburgh. He did not mail pipe bombs to political opponents. On the other hand, I believe he has the responsibility to set the tone of our national discourse. Through his public pronouncements, messages, and tweets he has the opportunity to encourage a more positive dialogue and help promote civility.
He, more than anyone else, has the ability to speak about others, like immigrants, in a way that promotes respect and understanding while maintaining fidelity to the law. I do not know the president. Some say that leading by example or setting a more civil tone does not come naturally to him. Even if true, I respectfully encourage him to try harder. Americans will appreciate even the smallest good faith effort. We will rally around our president, as we have for previous presidents during difficult times.
Many Americans do not receive their news from the mainstream media. Today, we are informed through multiple sources and mediums. Some do not operate or abide by a code of ethics or standards. They have no filter or regulator to ensure accuracy and fairness in the information they distribute or otherwise make available. Political bias sometimes infects even the traditional newsrooms. It is little wonder that some Americans become worried and angry, feeling the need to respond to perceived threats to their jobs, their families, and to their very way of life.
Those fears are often unfounded or exaggerated, and even if just partly true, they certainly never justify violence. We can and must do more to raise the level of civility in our debate. As citizens we should try to be better informed about policy issues and the reasons for the decisions by our government officials. We should work harder to better appreciate the hopes and concerns of others. In our land of over 300 million souls, we have far more that unites us than divides us. Let us go forward as one nation standing together with all of our brothers and sisters.

0,11/02/18 07:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/414139-how-freedom-dies-in-america,How freedom dies in America,"Founders of our constitutional republic studied Julius Caesar’s books, “The Gallic Wars” and “The Civil Wars,” to learn why ancient Rome’s republic failed, descending into civil war and becoming an imperial dictatorship.
Intriguingly, missing from Caesar’s books — written by one of world history’s greatest generals and statesmen — are their first and last pages that, like books today, would be the introduction and summation, saving for first and last those thoughts most profound. 
While stoking my fireplace with old papers from the attic, our dog Teeny retrieved from the pile this forgotten scroll, which I purchased from an antiquarian in Petrizzi long ago, and have pried from Teeny’s furry jaws to share with readers of The Hill:
“I, Julius Caesar, last night had a dream.
“I dreamed far across the sea, in the distant future, there would be a New World.  
“I dreamed men of that New World, centuries from now, would look back to learn lessons from our successes and our mistakes so they could better govern themselves.
“Something called a ‘President’ would lead them in war and peace. Not an emperor or a king, the president’s powers would be limited by laws.
“The president would be elected to represent all the people by something called an ‘Electoral College.’ So even farmers, miners, cattle drovers and others living and working in often sparsely-populated provinces, doing jobs necessary to build and feed and sustain the great cities, would not become slaves to the urban masses.
“This thing called an Electoral College would make the president beholden even to the farmers and laborers living in remote provinces, doing hard jobs necessary for the cities to exist.
“The Electoral College is a safeguard against mob rule by the urban poor, and a safeguard against aristocratic rule by the urban rich.
“Whether urban rich or poor, the cities cannot feed or clothe or house themselves without products supplied to the populous cities by provinces that are far less populated, but indispensable to urban life.
“The Electoral College prevents dictatorship of the cities over the farmers, miners, cattle drovers and others who feed and sustain the cities, by giving them greater representation than their numbers.
“The beguiling principle, ‘One man, One vote,’ is unfair for electing a president who must represent all the people, when ‘One man, One vote’ means slavery for the provinces to the whims of the cities.
“I dreamed there was something called a ‘Congress’ that made the laws. And in this New World of the future, the laws must be obeyed by everyone, even the president.
“Senators and representatives in the Congress are popularly elected according to the principle ‘One man, One vote.’ But every province, no matter how small or sparsely populated, has two senators, as a safeguard against mob rule by a combination of the few, most populous provinces.
“So in the Senate, the interests of all the provinces are represented equally.
“But the Senate is balanced by a House, where representatives are popularly elected, and provinces with bigger populations get more representatives.
“So in the House, the popular will prevails.
“I dreamed there was something called a ‘Supreme Court’ to make sure laws passed by Congress and actions by the president are consistent with something called ‘the Constitution,’ designed to protect the rights of the people and delimit the powers of the state.
“Thus, in my dream, the government of this New World comprises the best of all the systems of government developed by Rome and Greece and the most brilliant philosophers of our time, the best of monarchy, and of our Roman republic and the Greek democracy, and of new systems we have not conceived — all ingeniously designed to check and balance each other.  
“It is a machine designed to thwart tyranny of the elites and tyranny of the mob, and to give a voice to everyone.”
“A president! An Electoral College! A Congress! A Supreme Court! What great ideas!
“If we had these things in Rome, maybe we wouldn’t have mob rule. Maybe I wouldn’t have to fight this civil war.
“But my dream became a nightmare.
“The New World degenerated into bitter partisanship, quarreling and violence. Reason and probity were shouted down. Even academies rejected logic, tolerance and free exchange of ideas.
“In my nightmare, even the best-designed government could not save the nation from chaos when too many among the elites and among the people lacked virtue.
“And waiting to pounce on the New World like ravenous lions were tyrannies — barbarians worse than the Gauls and Parthians — eager to destroy and enslave free peoples.
“The lions leapt clawing, and I awoke with a cry.
“Was my nightmare really about today, and not the future? I cross the Rubicon tomorrow and into civil war.
“The Parthians are already attacking in the east.
“My friend and legate, Aulus Hirtius, tells me to stop dreaming or I will end up with a knife in my back.
“Must the world always be ruled by the sword? Does no one learn from history?”
Don’t be a barbarian. Vote on Nov. 6.

added incentive to reset his agenda for 2019, regardless of whether or not the anticipated Democratic blue wave in the midterm elections materializes next week.
A key element of that agenda should be the introduction of a financial transaction tax dedicated to payments for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, unemployment insurance and other forms of public assistance. Such a tax will address the federal government debt and the growth of entitlements, two of the biggest threats to our economic health.
We now owe more than $21 trillion and counting. No matter how you state that amount, it has never been higher in our history, and it will continue to grow despite predictions of increased revenue. While some may disagree, the tax cut legislation passed last year is likely to yield more revenue through growth. Still, the prediction of an insurmountable mountain of debt must be directly addressed by our policymakers.
The focus of debt solutions has been the perennial lament that we have to stop spending money we do not have. As long as we have lawmakers in Congress who politicize debt limits, nothing short of default will stop the debt junkies from raiding the legacy of our children. Management of the debt must encompass the elements of to whom we actually owe the debt, how much debt we really owe, and how to find a systematic way not only to service it but to reduce it. This has to be done while finding the political leverage to keep the government focused on realistic fiscal goals.
Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, and unemployment insurance eat up about 60 percent of the total federal budget. These programs are funded by an arcane 19th century income tax system that pulls us away from any real hope of finding a solution to the debt issue. There is just not enough available income to service the debt. Something must change.
Among the many possible approaches to this issue could be a separate dedicated tax to directly fund all economic security payments that would effectively depoliticize the broad spectrum of entitlements. This type of tax would be equalizing to the responsibility it funds, much like a bridge toll. The tax would support all economic security payments without ever having to expand the debt to maintain the whole system, which now impinges on national defense and other federal expenditures.
Enacting a dedicated financial transaction tax would eliminate the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax withholding from wages. Such a move that should find populist favor. Social Security and health care can be easily fixed with this kind of a tax system, so fixing Social Security and health care would have to simultaneously address the national debt.
This solution is actually rather simple. It is much the same as interstate highway maintenance, which is funded with the gas tax. A separate dedicated transaction tax may work well. Various forms of this have been tried with success in Brazil, India, Pakistan, and Australia. In America, a transaction tax of 2 percent to 3 percent of all bank withdrawals paid by consumers and businesses alike and collected electronically could raise enough revenue annually to fund all economic security payments.
Such taxes would relieve the income tax system from having to service such payments. Instead of redistributing wealth, it would more fairly distribute the government obligation for entitlements and revamp America into an economically viable Social Security system. Both taxpayers and businesses should embrace the idea of financial transaction taxes, as it is the key to the health of our fiscal future.

paid a somber visit to Pittsburgh yesterday. He lit candles and lay stones on Star of David markers memorializing those murdered in the Tree of Life Synagogue last Saturday. Is this a turning point? Has the shooting shocked him into sobriety? No. We have seen all this before. He cuts into the fabric of American life with sharp invective, then offers the thin bandage of a teleprompter speech. He mouths words while winking to his real audience, as if letting them into his little inside joke.
The joke is on us. This is uncharted territory. We have seen it reflected in ugly moments in our history. But this is different. Anti-semitism is not new in this country. A president whose invective seems to summon and inspire anti-semitism is. Racism is not a Trump phenomenon. A movement built around white nationalism that is coached and coaxed by a president is. Bigotry against the LGBTQ community is not new. A president singling out transgender Americans for isolation and second class citizenship is.
We have had violence and hatred and bigotry in our history. Up to now, responsible presidents have sought to heal the wounds. This one likes pouring salt in them. This one thinks you can fan the flames of hatred, then blame the press for reporting on the burning. We have reached the dangerous nexus of desperation and discrimination. We have a president who is about to lose his majority in the House, trying to control the narrative, and seeking to energize his base to mitigate the defeat.
How desperate? Remember the canard that we must fight the terrorists over there, so that we do not have to fight them here? We now have a president who wants to fight migrants here instead of containing them there. He is willfully misusing our military by sending 5,200 troops to the border against a faux invasion. In his cable television mind, soldiers are props, extras to be stage managed on a Fox News spectacle.
He was not able to get his military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Now he will get it in Laredo. The deployment, by the way, is an open admission that his foreign policy has failed catastrophically. He has been unable to work with other nations to control the conditions that spark caravans, so he will let refugees walk all over his failed foreign policy and meet them at the border, right before the midterm elections.
The president is so desperate to rally his base that in the wake of the deaths of 11 Jews in their synagogue, he blew another dog whistle, this one on Monday against a free press which he called “the enemy of the people.” As if egging on one failed pipe bomber was not enough. Now he will test the willingness of yet another maniac to strike next.
Next week marks the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the attacks against synagogues and the murders of Jews in Germany and Austria. For the American Jewish community, this was a grotesque part of history. Now it is a headline in Pittsburgh. The attacks in Nazi Germany were orchestrated by the government. The president certainly is not orchestrating these attacks today. But he is definitely in the orchestra that is playing an old familiar tune louder than any American president ever has.
That is what makes this so different and dangerous. If you do not send a message by voting in the midterm elections, or by supporting opponents to the president, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, it is going to get unimaginably worse for our nation. Then it will be on you.

I did not know what to expect from a community in the aftermath of a mass shooting. What do you say? Would there be fear or resentment? I expected tears and hugs, and I saw a lot of that, but I was blown away by one big thing. It was the presence of love. Everywhere you looked, there was so much love. Asians, Muslims, Christians, Jews, all Americans, all Pittsburghers, all came together with love in their hearts and souls. We must never take that for granted.
Of late it seems we have taken each other for granted. There has been so much anger and vitriol in our public discourse. On Saturday morning, on the Jewish Shabbat, that anger boiled over in the form of the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the history of our nation. For a short time, a house of worship turned into a house of horror. As shocking as it is, we know that anti-Semitism is on the rise. As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has bluntly said, “Jews were killed in a synagogue. They were killed because they are Jews. The location was chosen because it is a synagogue.”
When I first heard the news, I was instantly brought back to a story my grandfather told me of how he fled Poland to escape the pogroms. America was a beacon of hope that promised him freedom to worship without fear. I immediately called Rabbi Arthur Schneier and asked if he would join me and Governor George Pataki to lead a mission to Pittsburgh to represent the appeal of conscience. While I did not know what to expect, I will be forever thankful that we went because what I saw in Pittsburgh, while heartbreaking, was also inspiring and reaffirming.
We met with Pittsburgh police chief Scott Schubert. He is built like a steel beam, with a quiet determination and a deep molten passion for his city. Four of his brave police officers were wounded risking their lives in engaging the shooter in the synagogue. Schubert trained his men right, who rushed into the synagogue instead of standing down. I salute these heroes for their courage, where other officers have stood down.
We met with Pittsburgh police officer Daniel Meade, who was one of the first responders on the scene. He and his partner quickly charged into the synagogue and engaged the shooter, providing some worshippers precious time to escape. Visiting Meade in the hospital, where he was recovering from his wound, he told us that all he wanted was to get back on the street and protect Squirrel Hill, the neighborhood he loves.
Later, we were bedside with Andrea Wedner, who was shot with her mother Rose Mallinger praying beside her. As she told her story, we stood transfixed. We cried together, as Andrea described how for a split second, she saw the shooter out of the corner of her eye and attempted to move in front of her mother. But it was too late. Andrea was shot twice and her mother Rose, who was 97 years old and full of life, was gone in the blink of an eye. It is a tragic story so unbelievable and incomprehensible.
That evening, we joined the community for a moving and amazing interfaith memorial service. The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall was packed to the rafters, with thousands jammed inside while hundreds more stood outside in the cold rain. This was a life changing experience. Pittsburgh is a big city with the heart of a small town. Speakers of all different faiths together sounded a common refrain of love and light.
The strong people of Pittsburgh have the grace to know what so many politicians fail to grasp. It is that now is not the time for pointing fingers, but a time for holding hands. As one speaker lectured politicians, it is not a time to be politically correct, it is time to do something. These words brought a standing and thundering ovation that shook the hall.
We will never know whether our toxic political climate played a role in unleashing the hate that took nearly a dozen lives too soon, but that does not mean we should not demand better. Scott Schubert deserves better, Daniel Meade deserves better, Andrea Wedner deserves better, Rose Mallinger deserves better, as do the other precious souls that were ripped from this life too soon at Tree of Life Synagogue. We deserve better.
We will not let the hatred of anti-Semitism take root in America. Together we will raise our voices with powerful messages of love to drown out the anger and silence the vitriol in our nation. We must commit, as Abraham Lincoln did, that as we remember the dead “we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.”

Across the United States, the prospect of frightening images have some pledging to skip the holiday or closely shield their children. It is not the scary decorations or costumes but “cultural appropriation” that has triggered a tradition of recrimination and anger. Colleges and universities have warned students not to dress as Indian chiefs or Mexican bandits, while parents have publicly debated whether they can allow their children to dress as the Black Panther or Moana without being accused of cultural appropriation or racism.
“Cultural appropriation” has become a common term on campuses and is receiving broader meaning with each passing year. In Utah, a high school student was denounced for wearing a Chinese dress to her prom. White students wearing hoop earrings or dreadlocks have been denounced, while there have been protests over serving sushi at Oberlin College, holding yoga classes at the University of Ottawa or having a “Mexican food night” at Clemson University. The reason behind such limitless forms of cultural appropriation is its limitless meaning. Fordham University law professor Susan Scafidi has defined the term as encompassing the “unauthorized use of another culture’s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols” and more.

That makes Halloween a nightmarish orgy of cultural appropriation. Colleges and universities now post warnings not to dress as Native Americans, geishas, samurai, or other images. Syracuse University even threatened a few years ago to have its campus police force students to remove “offensive” costumes. There is remarkably little debate over such directives because many faculty members fear being labeled as racist or insensitive. What is increasingly rare is any dialogue or willingness to accept that people can hold good faith views on both sides.
CNN political analyst Kirsten Powers dismissed the concerns of white people who object to being labeled racist over Halloween costumes, tweeting, “Dear white people who are upset that you can’t dress up as another race or culture for Halloween: your feelings don’t matter.” She went on to add that the only feelings that matter are of those who feel disrespected or mocked by appropriating their culture. Similarly, in an Everyday Feminism article a few years ago, Kat Lazo advised that people who do not see the inherent racism or cultural appropriation in costumes are “very privileged” individuals who “never had the misfortune of experiencing or witnessing acts of racism.” That of course is a common conversation stopper if someone says any objection to cultural appropriation means you are ignorant and likely a racist in denial.
There is another possibility that reasonable people can disagree. There are clearly racist costumes that most of us join in denouncing, such as blackface or other raw portrayals. However, the cultural appropriation movement opposes any depiction of another culture. Indeed, what constitutes a social norm can be hard to discern. A New York Times column gave a tortured account of whether parents could allow their children to dress as Black Panther. The article included advice on sitting down with kids to discuss racial implications of their choices and, as Texas Woman’s University professor Brigitte Vittrup warned, “by not mentioning it, by not talking about it, we’re essentially preserving the status quo.”
An article by Sachi Feris explored her struggle with her young daughter who wanted to dress like Moana or Elsa last year. She wrote, “I had some reservations regarding both costume choices” and about cultural appropriation, noting the “power” and “privilege” carried by “whiteness” and the standards of beauty that go along with it. Elsa did not reflect cultural appropriation but rather discomfort over how her character “sends the message that you have to be a certain way” to look “beautiful” or to be a “princess” and that you have to have blonde hair and blue eyes. Feris disliked the message. Moana was portrayed as a perfect nightmare for a white girl to adopt, since she told her daughter she is white like Elsa. She instead encouraged her daughter to be Mickey Mouse because this way she would not be “making fun of anyone or dressing up as a culture different from our own because Mickey Mouse is a pretend mouse!”
Ironically, under the standard definition, Halloween itself could be denounced as a raw cultural appropriation. The precursors to Halloween can be traced to the old Celtic tradition of Samhain that explores the line between the living and the dead. However, there has long been a fantasy tradition around the world of using Halloween festivities to pretend you are someone else, as shown by the British tradition of “fancy dress” balls.
Despite the dismissal by Kirsten Powers, there are legitimate concerns on both sides and legitimate questions of whether common cultural images should be viewed as owned or controlled by a group. There also is the debate over who decides in limiting such free expression. Last week, Aulii Cravalho, the actress who played Moana in the Disney movie, declared it “absolutely appropriate” for kids to dress up as the Polynesian princess if it is “done in the spirit of love” and “for the little ones who just want to dress up as their favorite heroine.” Is it enough for a native Hawaiian teenager, with a financial interest in the Disney movie, saying it is okay?
Cultural foods and images are shared in society and the arts, particularly in a pluralistic nation like the United States. Adopting a cuisine or a costume is not “appropriating” a culture. Those are part of the mosaic of shared influences and images in a diverse free society. Dressing as a bandit from the movie “Treasure of Sierra Nevada” is not appropriating the Mexican culture. It is mimicking the character of Alfonso Bedoya.
Notably, motivation or message seems irrelevant to the definition of cultural appropriation. It does not matter if such symbols were viewed as celebrating the purity or bravery of a group. Certainly, many costumes incorporate cultural images that have exaggerated or oversimplified elements. But when children dress up as princesses, they are fantasizing, just as they do in dressing as cowboys or soldiers or samurai. They often are portraying positive elements like courage or grace in wearing those cultural images. Is it necessary to dump all our adult anxieties on our children or draw connections to our existing social problems?
The alternative is that we accept that cultural icons like Moana are shared and become part of a broader cultural tradition and dialogue. That little girl in the Indian outfit just might be a little girl who wants to be like Pocahontas, a heroine who is strong and unafraid, nothing more. By the way, it is pretty cool to see kids still pretending and dressing up without having to carry all of our problems, from rapes to racism, as they file down our streets on Halloween. We somehow forget how to do that along the way to adulthood. Maybe, just maybe, we have something to learn from that samurai or princess who comes knocking on our door on Halloween.

0,10/28/18 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/413510-biggest-election-winner-polarization-in-america,Biggest election winner? Polarization in America,"In looking at all of the polling available, it is clear that, to the extent that there is any momentum in the midterm elections, it is now marginally — and I underscore marginally — to the Republicans, at least certainly where the Senate is concerned. When we began the fall election cycle, we had thought that there was at least some chance that the Democrats would win the Senate. That outcome now seems unlikely. Republicans hold clear leads in Senate races in Texas, Tennessee, and North Dakota, all of which were considered at one point to be in play for the Democrats.
In Texas, Republican Ted Cruz
has expanded his over Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke to a comfortable margin after several weeks during which the race was thought to be a potential pickup for the Democrats, especially given the historic fundraising levels that O’Rourke achieved. In Tennessee, where Republican Marsha Blackburn
and Democrat Phil Bredesen were virtually in tied in the polls earlier this month, Blackburn now leads Bredesen by just over six points.
In North Dakota, Republican Kevin Cramer
has expanded his lead over Democrat Heidi Heitkamp
by 10 points over the last five weeks, with the latest poll putting Kramer at 56 percent and Heitkamp at 40 percent. This seat was considered to be very much in play for Democrats just weeks ago. The two other most likely Democratic targets are races that are now both within the margin of error. In Nevada, Republican Dean Heller
is now neck and neck with Democrat Jackie Rosen. In Arizona, Republican Martha McSally
is virtually tied with Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.
Barring the unforeseen, it appears likely that the Republicans will gain one or two seats in the Senate, and the worst case for them is that they will keep their 51 seats. The House is a different story. It seems unlikely there will be a blue wave, as estimates by Real Clear Politics show a Democratic pickup of about 26 seats, with Five Thirty Eight estimating a pickup of 36 seats. My own sense is that there will be a gain of around 28 seats for Democrats, though there is at least the possibility that Republicans, should there be the red wave which Donald Trump
has spoken of, could well narrowly hold the House, but I would tend to doubt that.
Ultimately, the Democratic campaign has been without a positive message, and has been essentially just based on opposition to the president, which was much more effective when his approval rating was close to 40 percent than it is now that his average approval rating is closer to 45 percent and going up in most polls. Similarly, the generic vote for Congress, which had been in some polls as high as double digits, has gotten down to about six or seven points for the Democrats, with some polls estimating this to be even lower single digits.
Indeed, my own sense is that the Democrats, in not having a coherent position on immigration and not having a solid narrative against the Republicans on the economy, have been playing largely defense and running individual campaigns on local issues, and using overarching opposition to Trump to unify the disparate voices in the party.
Still, even with the Democratic victory of a narrow majority in the House, the new session of Congress will begin almost certainly investigations of the president and the possibility of a reinvestigation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh
, along with the introduction of legislation for things such as Medicare for all, a guaranteed job for all Americans, and a strengthening of ObamaCare. Put another way, my best expectation is that the polarization we have seen now is just the beginning.
While I have argued in these pages as passionately as a I can for civility, my fear is that we will not achieve it even in the wake of bombings and shootings. After the midterm elections, we will face heightened polarization and division between a narrowly Democratic House and a narrowly Republican Senate that will further lead to gridlock and only will make America even more vulnerable to our mobilized and empowered allies, whether they be Russia or China or North Korea or Iran. I am pessimistic, and my sense is that my pessimism will become even more justified in the aftermath of these historic midterm elections.

Mr. Jeff Zucker, I would ask you, respectfully, to lower your voice as well.
This is not a fight between the media and the president of the United States. This is not a fight between our political parties. Nor is this a fight for the soul of the country. This is terrorism, pure and simple.
This is an effort to destabilize our country, whether or not the pipe bombs mailed to a growing list of individuals and institutions were meant to all detonate or not. This is a serious national crisis.
We all need to lower our rhetoric, to come together as a nation, and to just stop the hate, the polarization, the division and the finger-pointing — it just doesn’t work. It plays into the hands of our enemies, it makes us weaker, and it puts all of us at risk of foreign nations who can take advantage of the polarization, the division and, frankly, the disorganization that exists to advance their interests in a multiplicity of ways.
For many years now, I have been talking about this. I have written a book, called “Hopelessly Divided,” and another called “Mad As Hell,” and I have sought, among many other observers, to explain that the weaker we are at home, the more divided we are — and the weaker we are overseas as well, playing into the hands of enemies like North Korea, Russia, China and Iran.
Indeed, this is serious. This is real. This is not meant to be a long, thoughtful piece. It is meant to be a simple plea.
Mr. President, Mr. Zucker — along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles Schumer
(D-N.Y.), House Speaker Paul Ryan
(R-Wis.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.): Put the events of the last few months behind us, put the Brett Kavanaugh
hearings behind us, and stop pointing fingers at the southern border or blaming the other side for a crisis.
Come together, solve our problems, do a deal on immigration, on health care, and on all of the other challenges facing our nation.

Douglas warned of a danger that few truly acknowledge: American democracy is fallible. “As nightfall does not come all at once,” he wrote, “neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged.”
Douglas’s warning could not be more salient today. You know the fable. A frog suddenly thrust into boiling water will jump out. But if it’s put into warm water that’s brought slowly to a boil, the frog won’t notice it is in danger. It gets cooked to death.
As Americans await the results of upcoming midterm election, all three branches of the federal government — the president, Congress, and a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court — are currently under Republican control. To date, the Senate has confirmed 26 of President Trump
’s appointments to the United States Courts of Appeals — the highest number ever for a president after two years in office. His judicial picks are young, with a median age of 49. Because very few cases make it to the U.S. Supreme Court, and because all federal judges have life tenure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) strategy of obstructing President Obama’s judicial nominations in a bid to build a more conservative federal bench has worked. 
The potential result: A multi-generational chokehold on constitutional interpretation and related social and fiscal policy — especially if Democrats fail to win a majority of one or both chambers of Congress next month. 
But so long as the economy is humming along, the counterargument goes, who cares about the vagaries of politics? Many people are likewise unphased that certain public office-holders regularly exhibit shocking behavior — but this point of view is severely short-sighted. One-party rule was not meant to be in America.
People talk loosely about American democracy, but the framers of the Constitution — wary of monarchies — created, more precisely, a republic. Rather than tallying up individual votes on specific issues, elected representatives make policy on voters’ behalf.
The framers opted for a republic because they worried about the inevitable rise of “factions” in America — ideologically motivated subgroups that are inclined to believe misinformation in service of “some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community,” as James Madison aptly put it.
Today, factions are on the rise, with a plethora of “fake news” internet sites — many manufactured by foreign powers seeking to harm American democracy — and “bots,” or robots, that spread lies through computer-generated social media accounts. As a result, a good portion of the American population is being scammed on a daily basis. Couple all of this with the newest “deepfake” technologies — enabling the creation of false but lifelike videos showing political opponents in compromising situations — and the framers’ worry that democracy will be overcome by deception-induced factions becomes very real.
These days, the framers’ answer to factions — thoughtful, measured decision-making by elected representatives with competing political ideologies — is failing. The Trump administration is mired in scandal, yet the Republican-led Congress — frantic about the prospect of being summarily discarded by Trump and his fiercely loyal base — is allergic to oversight and accountability. Bipartisan committees are all-but extinct. As the recent process of confirming Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh showed, Congress’s work has become an all-or-nothing, winner-takes-all exercise — and one party currently holds all the cards. 
Without healthy, honest, fact-based debate, American voters are left to fend off bad information on their own. And there’s no obvious way to do that effectively these days.
The brokenness of our representative system of government is further entrenched by the lack of term limits on members of Congress, as well as the widespread practice of gerrymandering — the carving up of congressional districts in ways that ensure one party’s hold on the electorate. 
This is all very bad for democracy, folks.
Any intellectually honest debate about one-party rule produces one inviolate conclusion: that it’s better for everyone — regardless of political party — to have a functioning system of checks and balances, in which those in power face meaningful pushback from political opponents, and the ultimate power resides with the people. Without accountability, tyranny thrives.

0,10/22/18 09:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/412490-census-citizenship-question-will-help-voting-rights-enforcement,Census citizenship question will help voting rights enforcement,"The latest disconnect between Washington elites and mainstream Americans involves Trump administration plans to ask a question about citizenship in the 2020 census. The simple question — “are you a citizen?” — previously appeared on the census, but renewing it in 2020 has triggered hysteria inside the beltway. Adding to the hysteria is the fact than a former adviser to President Trump
voiced support for the idea to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross
. That the adviser happens to be named Steve Bannon
sends the elites into a frenzied resistance we haven’t seen since, well, the Saturday that Brett Kavanaugh
was confirmed.
At issue is the decision to add a census question about whether the respondent is an American citizen. This is the same survey that recently asked how many flush toilets you have in your house, yet activists find the citizenship question too intrusive. It is so intrusive to them that the whole matter goes to trial in a federal courtroom on November 5 in New York City. In the meantime, the Supreme Court has been asked to block portions of the lawsuit against the citizenship question. Should the court, with Justice Kavanaugh in the majority, greenlight the citizenship question, it might prompt hysterics beyond our wildest imagination. Bannon, Kavanaugh, and citizenship, oh my.
The Hill recently reported proto president Senator Kamala Harris
(D-Calif.) warned that the Trump administration’s reinstatement of a citizenship question would “weaponize” the 2020 census. Harris is right in a way, as collecting citizenship data would enable the Justice Department to better enforce and weaponize the Voting Rights Act, particularly in smaller jurisdictions where robust citizenship data have never been available.
I know this because when I was at the Justice Department enforcing the Voting Rights Act, I brought cases where citizenship data would have bolstered that law. I have filed a brief with the federal court detailing how citizenship data strengthens enforcement of this important civil rights law. It details the many instances in the past where the Justice Department explicitly cited citizenship population in Voting Rights Act enforcement. Unfortunately, the Justice Department briefing, so far, has failed to press the point in court that the Trump administration is making in public.
Pick any Voting Rights Act case brought by the Justice Department, and you’ll see on the face of the complaints that the Justice Department relies on citizenship data to draw a sample minority legislative district. An objective observer will also see a trend that smaller jurisdictions across the country get overlooked for Voting Rights Act enforcement.
Lightly populated jurisdictions are overlooked because the existing census doesn’t capture robust citizenship data. I litigated a rare exception when I was at the Justice Department. Lake Park, a small town in Florida, was 48 percent black, according to the 2000 census, yet it never yielded a single black city council member in its history. Because of its size, citizenship data was lacking, and a large Haitian population also existed in Lake Park. The case would have been stronger had data been available.
There are many towns, counties and school boards on the margins where a lack of citizenship data takes them off the list of places effectively protected by the Voting Rights Act when it comes to redistricting. The voting rights alarmism that has become so familiar falls silent when it involves extending protections to Americans who live in smaller jurisdictions with larger alien populations. The lack of a citizenship question doesn’t just impair voting rights enforcement in small towns.
Even in the bigger cities, the Justice Department is stuck relying on citizenship “estimates” to determine if the Voting Rights Act is being violated. Not asking the citizenship question on the census has eroded African American political clout in places like Los Angeles. For decades, black Los Angeles residents were demographically squeezed out of local government by a growing Hispanic population of mixed citizenship.
Over time, Hispanic populations that were a mix of both citizens and aliens had the population numbers when it came to drawing district lines. A black majority-minority district might require a given population of residents, almost all citizens, while a Hispanic district next door would have the same total population, but a smaller population of citizens. Blacks ended up being the losers here because line drawers didn’t have and didn’t use the best citizenship data from the census.
The Trump administration decision to ask about citizenship on the 2020 census will help Justice Department to enforce the Voting Rights Act. Asking the question on the census if someone living in the United States is a citizen makes sense to everyone except beltway elites and those people in power concerned about their own political survival.

That may sound like a truism, but when you have events like Democratic activists in Nevada attacking the campaign manager of Republican Adam Laxalt, and President Trump
going to Montana and saying it was great that Congressman Greg Gianforte
body slammed a reporter before his victory in the special election, that is just plain wrong. It’s wrong if the Democrats do it, it’s wrong if the Republicans do it, it’s wrong if anyone does it.
Let me be clear: Political violence has no place in our system, threats of violence have no place in our system, and it is pointless to try to say that Democrats are worse than Republicans, or that Republicans are worse than Democrats.
For the purposes of this piece, and indeed I believe to the American people, both sides are culpable — and that is just plain wrong, and is wholly unacceptable.
We have emerging crises in health care, the budget, the debt, the deficit, and we need conciliation and consensus if we are ever going to achieve positive change.
We cannot do this by demonizing the other side, and as Nikki Haley
said, compellingly, at the Al Smith Dinner on Thursday Night in New York, “in America, our political opponents are not evil,” she added “they are just our opponents.”
I think this was the first step in Ambassador Haley beginning the process of disassociating herself from President Trump. Mind you, I do not believe that Ambassador Haley is preparing for to run in 2020, though she is probably indeed available to be on the ticket should the president decide to drop Vice President Mike Pence
, who has only served to be an acolyte for the president.
Ultimately, Haley served a more important point. Without betraying the president or her Republican principles, she has made it clear that there are certain values that are transcendent to American society that cannot be compromised, and evil around the world needs to be called out and judged for what it is — whether it be in Syria, South Sudan, or elsewhere.
Personally, I was uplifted by Ambassador Haley’s speech, just as I have been depressed by much of what has passed for campaign to 2018.
Right now, it appears that the Democrats have a clear but narrow advantage in the House races, and Republicans have a clear advantage in the Senate. That means that we are going to have a divided government, one way or another, and I cannot see how we can go forward and achieve our goals if we do not recognize explicitly, clearly, and unabashedly the need to compromise.
Now let me provide a slightly different take on the collusion investigation. It is very clear, regardless of special counsel Robert Mueller
’s report, that the Russians did intrude into our election, and it is clear that they had a demonstrable impact. Whether they threw the election to Trump or not, time will tell.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson at the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania has written a scholarly book “Cyberwar” in which she forensically examines the campaign and makes the case that cyberattacks by Russian hackers and trolls were decisive, but I do not think the evidence at this point is clear.
Though, what is clear, is that the Republicans have succeeded Vladimir Putin’s main goal: to further divide us, to polarize our country, and ultimately, to weaken us.
Of that, I am sure. They have won and achieved their goal, and we have lost. We have real enemies, and we have real challenges that require a united country with a united sense of purpose.
I was uplifted by Ambassador Haley’s speech, and hope it is the first of more to come from both the Trump administration, and the Democratic leadership in Congress.

is claiming that exploding budget deficits caused by Republican tax cuts need to be cured by cutting Social Security and Medicare. Can you say “chutzpah”?
With less than three weeks left until the midterms, McConnell may have just handed the Democrats the economic argument they had been longing for at the worst possible moment for the Republicans. According to the latest projections, the odds of Republicans retaining control of the House are fading. The number crunchers now peg the likelihood of a House controlled by Democrats at better than 83 percent.
While the boomlet after the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh
may have saved the Republican majority in the Senate, it may have run aground in the House battlegrounds. When Mia Love
is running in a dead heat and the seat held by Jim Jordan
is no longer “safe”, the president and his party have plenty to worry about. That was before the Senate majority leader stepped on a figurative grenade and signaled that he was ready to throw granny from a moving train to placate the donor gods.
Even as the 2020 presidential campaign for Donald Trump
vacuums up huge dollars, House Republicans are being treated like the neglected stepchildren of their party, being outraised and outspent by Nancy Pelosi
and the Democrats at every turn. The latest campaign spending reports reveal that more than 70 Democratic House hopefuls have bested their Republican opponents in the race for campaign dollars.
The Democratic fundraising advantage appears to be historic, according to stats guru Nate Silver. This week, he tweeted: “Democrats have raised almost 2/3 of the total money for the House … Despite the fact that the GOP holds the incumbency advantage. Never been anything like that before in our House fundraising data, which goes back to 1998.”
The numbers fittingly tell the story. Democrat Max Rose bested incumbent Republican Dan Donovan by five to one in fundraising for Staten Island’s congressional seat. In New York’s Hudson Valley, Antonio Delgado, the Democratic challenger, raised $3.8 million in the last quarter. By comparison, John Faso
, the incumbent Republican representative in his first term, only added $1 million to his campaign coffers.
From the looks of things, it appears that Republicans are far more enchanted with their president than with the House Republican. It is also safe to say that only the Koch Brothers will miss Paul Ryan
when he is gone. To add insult to injury, McConnell inadvertently tossed the Democrats a lifeline just a day after Senator Elizabeth Warren
decided to share with the world that her DNA proved that she was of fractional Native American descent. His remarks also followed hours after a federal judge dismissed the Stormy Daniels defamation suit against the president. Before our eyes, “Cocaine Mitch” was morphing into “Buzzkill McConnell.”
As to be expected, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee seized on McConnell’s comments, and the pile on began. Senator Ron Wyden
weighed in: “Here’s what this means: SOCIAL SECURITY is on the ballot. MEDICARE is on the ballot. MEDICAID is on the ballot.” Not to be outdone, Warren gave a campaign lesson of her own: “Step 1: GOP explodes the deficit with $1.5 trillion in tax giveaways to wealthy donors. Step 2: GOP uses the deficit they created as an excuse to slash Social Security and Medicare.” As a matter of fact, this time she was persuasive.
If the tax cuts had trouble gaining traction with the public before McConnell’s pronouncement, they will face an even tougher slog now. Early on, the cuts were the bane of wealthy blue America as the legislation effectively ended the state and local tax deduction upon which many Californians and New Yorkers turned to for relief. Now the rest of the country can detest them as well and look forward to Election Day.
Even before McConnell’s proclamation, the cuts were rejected by voters by a double digit margin. Contrary to Republican hopes and promises, the cuts have once again failed to pay for themselves. Now America is being asked to foot the bill for the Republican gift to the donor class. Nancy Pelosi’s hands must be tingling. The Speaker’s gavel is within her reach.

0,10/17/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/411835-susan-collins-and-the-mob-mentality,Susan Collins and the mob mentality,"When Republican senator Susan Collins
joined 49 of her colleagues to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh
to the United States Supreme Court, critics pledged to defeat her in the next election. Indeed, advocates who oppose Kavanaugh raised millions in contributions that would be released to her next opponent if she dared to vote for his confirmation.
Faculty and alumni of St. Lawrence University, however, are not satisfied in changing her future. They want to rewrite part of her past. In a raw act of retaliation, they are demanding that the college rescind an honorary degree awarded to Collins in 2017. Just one year ago, Collins was honored for her independent thinking and integrity, but now professors and graduates want her stripped of the degree for exercising such values in opposition to their own views. For exercising such independence, she is now denounced as lacking “integrity and commitment” to justice.
The demand could easily be dismissed as the expression of the far left element at a well known liberal institution. In the end, it is unlikely that St. Lawrence will take this extreme action. Collins is, arguably, its most famous living graduate. However, it is part of a rising wave of intolerance across the country against conservative views, including actual assaults committed by faculties and students.
Before her Senate vote on Kavanaugh, Collins gave a thoughtful speech explaining why she had demanded further investigation into the allegations of sexual assaults raised against Kavanaugh and why she concluded those allegations remained unproven or refuted. One could certainly disagree with her logic or her view that no further investigation was necessary. According to one poll, more than 40 percent of Americans agreed with her, while 51 percent opposed the Kavanaugh confirmation.
Yet, almost 2,000 alumni and dozens of faculty at St. Lawrence want to punish Collins for reaching a conclusion opposite from theirs. She now is deemed to have deviated “from the path” and thus lacks the “core values” of the school. Of course, there was a time when “core values” were defined as tolerance of opposing views and the exercise of free speech.
If the letter of the graduates is hard to fathom, the cause becomes clearer when you read the letter from the roughly 100 professors supporting the action against Collins. The letter shows precisely why students could leave St. Lawrence with so little notion of intellectual integrity and tolerance. The professors implausibly assert that their call for this punitive action is “not rooted in partisan loyalties or disagreements.” Instead, their disagreement with her vote is considered sufficient justification to rescind the degree as a “fitting consequence to her detrimental and unprincipled actions.” The professors not only denounce the “rape culture” at St. Lawrence but declare that this culture “no doubt influenced the actions Senator Collins took during the Kavanaugh hearings.” That is right, Collins voted out of her own facilitation of a “rape culture.”
Across the country, faculty members have led students in shocking demonstrations against free speech and even violence against those with opposing views. While the violence is thankfully rare, the response can be unnerving. At the University of California at Santa Barbara, feminist studies professor Mireille Miller Young led her students in attacking pro-life advocates, stealing their display, and then committing battery on a young woman. Despite pleading no contest to criminal assault, Miller Young not only was retained but widely supported by faculty and students, including those who viewed the pro-life advocates as “terrorists” who should be kept off campus. This week, the University of Oregon gender studies department is featuring her as a speaker.
Last week, a Ryerson University employee attacked pro-life students on campus. Earlier, California State University assistant professor of public health professor Greg Thatcher led students in wiping out pro-life statements of students after telling them that they had no free speech outside of restricted zones. He is wrong but was still retained as faculty. Earlier this year, University of New Hampshire professor Joelle Ruby Ryan screamed profanities and tried to shut down an online talk show host who was calling for free speech protections on campuses. Last year, Middlebury College professor Allison Stanger was injured by protesters after she merely accompanied a controversial speaker to campus.
For too many professors and students, free speech is now viewed as a privilege to be enjoyed only by those with whom they agree. Indeed, the intolerance shown in the St. Lawrence campaign is often disguised as principles in works like “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook” by Dartmouth professor Mark Bray. This movement denounces classic liberalism. It rejects the notion of protecting free speech for its own sake and rejects “coexistence” in favor of a goal “to end their politics.”
Academic institutions once prided themselves on a broad array of divergent views and values. There was not a single “path” but rather common “principles” allowing students to find their own place in this world of ideas. It was based on mutual respect and tolerance for those holding opposing positions. Today, campaigns on campuses like the one at St. Lawrence reflect how ignorance of, and even hostility toward, these basic values is fueling our age of rage. Faculty are replicating their own intolerance in students who have been taught that free speech means the right to shut down or punish those with opposing views.
There is no longer a willingness to accept that people like Collins could come to good faith but opposing conclusions. It is easier to declare the Maine senator to be a champion of a “rape culture.” It may be true that critics will “end the politics” of Collins in the next election. That is fair game in a representative democracy. That is a right such as free speech protected by democratic institutions. However, this is different.
These professors and graduates are seeking to retroactively punish Susan Collins for reaching a conclusion different from their own. The professors denounced her for undermining the “crucial role of evidence based decision making in democratic processes” simply because she came to a different view of the evidence by using her once heralded independent judgment. These professors and students vividly demonstrate how power without principle is little more than a mob dressed up as a movement.

0,10/16/18 11:30 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/education/411242-teachers-keep-your-politics-on-kavanaugh-hearings-out-of-classroom,"Teachers, keep your politics on Kavanaugh hearings out of classroom","On the heels of the Kavanaugh hearings, some teachers have wondered aloud — via Twitter — how they should handle the contentious topic in their classrooms. While some teachers have no interest in touching the issue with a 10-foot pole, others may find it nearly impossible not to make mention of an event that consumed the nation for weeks. But we can learn a lot about how one educator in particular asked the Twitterverse for suggestions.
“I’m a teacher, and I don’t know what I’m going to say to my students if Kavanaugh gets confirmed. Do I tell them that this country doesn’t take sexual assault seriously? Do I tell them that truth and integrity don’t matter? What do I say?” asked Nicholas Ponticello.
Speaking as a parent, I’d have a huge problem if these were the best ideas my kids’ teacher could muster on how to discuss a topic that is complex, highly partisan, and very painful for many, not to mention far afield of his professional wheelhouse. Mr. Ponticello is a high school math teacher. And while many will say — and have said — that his only job is to teach math, I disagree. His responsibilities as an adult who spends his days with kids do extend beyond fractions and coefficients. But these additional responsibilities do not include injecting his personal politics or biases into the classroom, especially not in a way that may alienate some students — and by extension, their parents — who undoubtedly hold a starkly different opinion than he.
If I saw this tweet online and Mr. Ponticello was a teacher of one of my children, I’d be wary of the Kavanaugh discussions unless I knew that a free and open exchange of ideas could and would happen. And a conversation like that is incredibly hard to initiate and moderate on any topic, let alone one as sensitive and fractious as this. On the one hand, Mr. Ponticello is a private citizen and has the right to say what he wants online. And nothing about the tweet would bother me if it didn’t indicate that a) he had plans to try to “explain” a country that would allow Brett Kavanaugh
’s confirmation to the Supreme Court and b) it’s not clear that there’d be much room for nuance or opposing views.
Unsurprisingly, the thousands of responses Mr. Ponticello received reflect wide range of opinions because teachers across America are far from an ideological — or pedagogical — monolith.
Here is a small taste of the more than 8,000 replies:
“Nick, as a retired History and Government Teacher, I would present a factual timeline of events, (and eliminate all spin) and allow them 2 decide for themselves. Remember, a thousand questions are better than one good answer. It may take an entire period, block, or day, but do it,” wrote Steve Georgeff.
Said Sylvia Chan-Malik: “Remind them of history. Had class morning after election, my students were crying, despondent. Said think about the 60s, murders of Medgar Evers(’63), Malcolm X(’65), MLK (’68), Fred Hampton (’69), entire gen of Black leaders jailed, silenced. Said, “We fight. We always fight.”
“I would suggest an unslanted view of government. No matter how you stand politically it is wrong to offer a bias perspective to students of any age. You are a critical figure in their lives, teach them how to see both sides and make up their own mind,” offered Chris Gubbrud.
And from an educator who identifies herself as Michele@mca4ham: “I know exactly what you’re feeling, cried at school day Trump won. Impress upon them importance of voting, no matter which side they are on. How to be active citizens. How to be critical thinkers and how to evaluate media sources. Make sure they know they can pre-register to vote.”
Suffice it to say that there are countless parents, some of whom I know personally, who would be high-fiving Mr. Ponticello for the sole reason that they happen to share his views about Justice Kavanaugh. But I know just as many parents who would have a major problem with his tweet and who, if feeling generous, would advise him to “stick to teaching math.” Others, in a less forgiving mood, would be calling for his job. Parents have strong and varied ideas about the role of teachers and personal politics in classrooms.
So let’s flip the script. Let’s imagine a more politically conservative teacher who sent out a similar tweet in search of advice but followed by these very differently framed questions: “I’m a teacher, and I don’t know what I’m going to say to my students if Kavanaugh gets confirmed. Do I tell them that due process no longer matters in this country and that people are now presumed guilty instead of innocent? Do I tell them that corroboration and consistency of testimony don’t matter?”
This tweet would have those who align more with Mr. Ponticello seething and likely accusing the district of hiring a rape apologist to teach children. But if we are to believe that teachers should bring their politics and activism into the classroom, it seems that we need to include all teachers and all opinions. I know more than a few teachers whose tweets would more closely resemble my hypothetical than the one Mr. Ponticello posted.
Mr. Ponticello told The 74, “I really feel that civics is the No. 1 most important thing we can teach our students. You can’t just bury your head in the sand just because you’re the adult in the room.” He acknowledges that educators are expected to keep their biases at bay in the classroom and that these conversations are “tricky.”
“Tricky” is an understatement. And if his tweet is any indication of what a classroom discussion would be like, then, as a parent, I’d prefer he stick to math.

Almost since President Trump
’s inauguration, the prevailing thought has been that the left’s “outrage edge” would swamp Republicans beneath November 2018’s blue wave. Instead, Trump’s strong opposition has subsided, his strong support risen and the former gap is gone.
On Monday, Rasmussen released its daily tracking poll showing Trump’s job approval held an advantage (51 to 47 percent) over disapproval. That scant 4-percent advantage was his highest in 19 months.
Inside these broader approval numbers, lay even more significant “strong” ones. In addition to its overall job approval rating, Rasmussen also breaks out strong approval and disapproval. 
This is a perfect barometer of voter intensity, and intensity is important because November’s blue-wave predictions have been predicated on overwhelming anti-Trump sentiment. In Rasmussen’s Monday poll, President Trump’s strong ratings — positive and negative — were tied at 38 percent. 
The intensity gap’s vanishing act is a big detail because it was once very large. President Trump hit his nadir on Aug. 3, 2017 when he recorded a 26-percent net negative rating. Critics did not need a crystal ball to see what was clear: Republicans were in store for a midterm debacle.
President Trump’s ""strong"" return has been remarkable. A year ago, his strong rating was a net -19 percent. At the beginning of 2018, it was -15 percent. Just a month ago, it was still -10 percent.  Just a week ago, it stood at -8 percent. 
From his lowest point, President Trump has erased a 26-percent ""strong"" deficit. He has done so by taking 11 percent off his strong disapproval and putting 15 percent on his strong approval, with 8 percent coming in the last week alone.
This is not only a dramatic improvement, but a stark contrast to Obama eight years ago. On Oct. 8, 2010, Obama’s ""strong"" rating ratio was 29/41 percent. Trump’s 12-percent net advantage over Obama comes from significantly higher strong approval and slightly lower strong disapproval.  
Considering the large recovery, his comparative advantage over Obama and, most importantly, the enormous emphasis commentators have put on the intensity gap’s ramifications, it begs the question: What happened?
It could simply be that Americans have returned to their ideological and political moorings. According to 2016 exit polling, Republicans made up 33 percent of the electorate and conservatives 35 percent; Democrats were 36 percent and liberals 26 percent. The sides are close, so balancing over a Republican president is not inherently surprising.  
However, these groups were no less evenly split when this Republican president’s strong ratings were abysmal. If they are just “coming home,” at least it can be said that Trump’s performance is not stopping them — as he had until recently.  
More positively, President Trump’s performance could have proactively brought conservatives and Republicans “home.” A strong economy and two conservative Supreme Court justice confirmations in two years are just starters for both groups. 
But it is also very likely that the left itself is to blame for the president’s strong recovery. The price liberals have paid for keeping themselves enraged has been getting conservatives and moderates engaged for President Trump. There is clear evidence this is true.  
For one thing, eliminating his deepest strong deficit could not have been done simply by switching opponents to supporters. Together, both ""strong"" categories accounted for only 72 percent of respondents. When Trump pulled even at 38/38 percent, 76 percent were now identifying themselves as strong respondents — a 4-percent increase.  
For another, look at Rasmussen’s overall Trump job performance rating of 51/47 percent. The difference between strong and overall respondents is 22 percent. This 22-percent can be categorized as unaligned or moderate voters. 
To get to his overall rating, Trump had to garner 13 percent, while losing 9 percent, which means taking almost six out of 10 from this swing group.

Unlike 2016 and every day since, this wasn’t about Trump and the visceral hatred on the left for that one man, except indirectly. If it was, it would be easier to ignore. This was about important things that transcend any one president: competing views for the shape of our society, and how the new Democratic Party intends to compete.
Because of its absolute certitude in its moral superiority on matters of race, gender, abortion, #MeToo, income inequality, climate, immigration, and guns, this new version of the party has made clear it believes the ends justify the means.  
It will not respect the normative social contracts, such as elections must be respected even when your side loses, the winner has the right to make judicial appointments, set policy and execute it through the administrative state, and everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence.  All that is out the window.
The new extreme Democratic Party regards the Constitution as an antiquated hindrance to achieving its political goals, to be totally altered, or cast aside entirely.  Western Civilization is perceived as the well-spring of the oppressors, and the white male dominated Republican Party as the instrument of oppression.  
This rage fueled the mob in the streets and in the halls of Congress, bullying those who disagree. Nothing short of Kavanaugh’s scalp, guilty or not, would suffice as rough justice. Whereas the Republican war on women was always a convenient fiction of identity politics, the nation saw and understood the new Democratic Party’s war on white men is very real: they are now deemed indefensibly evil.
Senator Cory Booker
(D-N.Y.) said: “You are either complicit in the evil, or fighting against it.”  Apparently, if you don’t agree with him or aren’t enabling him, i.e. not a part of his mob, you are complicit in evil.
Never to be outdone, yesterday Hillary Clinton
doubled down on her infamous and dehumanizing “deplorables” comment with this gem: “You cannot be civil with [Republicans]…if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that's when civility can start again.” Synthesized: Give us power, then we’ll talk.
Andrew Breitbart famously said, “Politics is downstream from culture.” The culture that bred and raised the new extreme Democratic Party was created on elite college campuses, and now infects almost all of academia K-12 and higher education.
Until a generation ago, the central organizing principle of higher education was “the pursuit of truth.” Truth may be unattainable, but it was widely understood its pursuit through reading, civil discussion, exchange of ideas, exploration of one’s own and opposing thought developed an understanding of one’s own thinking and that of others, which fostered compassion and mutual respect. These are the sensibilities and skills necessary for moderation and for political compromise.
However, the new central organizing principle on campuses across the country is what liberals call “social justice.” The social sciences and humanities have been reduced to identifying the victims and the oppressors. The greater the victimhood, the greater the status of the victim and the greater the moral imperative. This is the root stock of identity politics, but it is not a preparation for responsible citizenship. It is indoctrination camp for intolerant liberals and would be revolutionaries.
For the new activist Democratic Party, the bedrock foundations of our society embedded in our Constitution such as rule of law, free speech, due process and presumption of innocence have been reduced to opportunities, not imperatives. Tools to be used when expedient to accomplish objectives, and otherwise ignored.
In stark contrast Senator Susan Collins
(R-Maine) stepped to the microphone and offered a reasoned, compassionate, and utterly American analysis and conclusion. She embraced the objective of #MeToo, but reminded us how to think about these things and effect change in our form of government. It was a lesson in the Constitution, rule of law, traditional American values and reasoned judgment.
In the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearings, the few remaining moderate Democrats find themselves passengers in the backseat of a minority party that has swerved hard left, lost the ability to have civil discourse, vilifies half the country or more, and is incapable of compromise.
The Kavanaugh hearings revealed that radicals have captured the Democratic flag. If the Democratic Party remains extreme, one unintended consequence is they remind the casual observer why it is so important to vote. If the Democrats fail to win the House or Senate in 2018, they will likely fail to win the presidency in 2020.

This op-ed, and the newly minted Republican talking point warning of an “angry mob” if Democrats win in November, betrays both how afraid the GOP and Trump are about the midterm elections and the lengths to which they will go to turn around their fortunes. 
Trump’s piece is so misleading that it is impossible to highlight all of the factual inaccuracies here. But let’s start with a few of the more easily fact-checked whoppers Trump boldly claims:
Trump claims that as a candidate, he promised to protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health-care insurance options that would lower premiums and that he kept that promise.
Facts say that the Trump administration joined a lawsuit brought by Republican attorneys general aimed at striking down parts of the Affordable Care Act, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions:
“President Donald Trump
isn’t playing it straight when it comes to his campaign pledge not to undercut health coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. Five weeks before midterm elections, he is telling voters that those provisions ‘are safe,’ even as his Justice Department is arguing in court that those protections in the Affordable Care Act should fall.” 
Trump also claims that he is fighting ""hard against the Democrats’ plan that would eviscerate Medicare.”
Well, facts are pesky things. The New York Times pointed out, “First, not only has Mr. Trump failed to strengthen Medicare and Social Security, the financial outlook for both trusts has largely worsened … In June, the government projected that Medicare funds would be depleted by 2026, three years earlier than estimated in 2017. The report noted that less money will flow into the fund because of low wages and lower taxes.” 
Also from the New York Times: Democrats have staunchly defended Medicare, and none of the health care proposals from Democrats would reduce Medicare benefits. 
Boldly, Trump continues to try to paint Republicans as the protectors of Medicare, as he states: “Republicans believe that a Medicare program that was created for seniors and paid for by seniors their entire lives should always be protected and preserved.” 
But again, facts tell us that congressional Republicans’ 2019 budget proposed huge cuts to Medicare. According to The Hill: “House Republicans offered a budget proposal that would cut mandatory spending by $5.4 trillion over a decade, including $537 billion in cuts to Medicare and $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other health programs.”
So the reality is that after passage of the massive GOP tax cut for the rich that balloons our deficits, worried Republicans looked to slash Medicare as well as Social Security for deficit reduction.
Trump also claims Democrats want ""open-borders socialism."" Nothing could be further from the truth — though it makes for a great talking point. He is creating a political euphoria for his base even if it is only a mirage.
No Democrat in the House or Senate or running for either is for open borders. While some candidates are talking about abolishing or reforming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the context is the restructuring of our immigration system so that ICE (or whatever it becomes) does not act like the militarized enforcer of a terror-based nationalistic police state.
In fact, in the last real immigration legislative debate, Democrats were pushing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would have added billions for border security, an E-verify system to ensure employers would not hire workers without documents and thousands more Border Patrol agents.
This does not sound like an open-border policy, but Trump never let a good set of facts get in the way of his fear-mongering.
Now we are hearing Trump at his last few rallies using the new tactic of referring to Democrats as an ""angry mob."" This phrase was seemingly started by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearing debacle in which self-proclaimed sexual assault survivors were being ignored by their elected officials.
Trump warned that if Democrats win the midterms, they will turn the country into Venezuela. It is beyond the pale for Trump to compare democratically elected officials to a dictator despot. Moreover, this line of attack is laughable coming from Trump.
He is the one who bestows nothing but compliments to the world’s most ruthless strongmen and dictators, like the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte, Turkey's Recep Erdoğan, Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
It is ironic that Trump, in his fear of losing, is using fear to try and hang on to power. 
But the “mob” is indeed angry. This group is made up of women, supportive men, Democrats, progressives, independents, party-less Republicans and everyone else who is sick of what this country has become under Trump and sycophantic Republican members of Congress who are incapable of holding him accountable.
So lies, alternative “facts” and fear will not work this time around for Trump and the GOP. America is taking its anger from the halls of Congress, to the streets and straight to the ballot box. We will remember in November.

. The realist in me who opposed his Supreme Court nomination now accepts that he is sworn in and takes his place on the bench. So what now?
He will have to come up to speed and, if I understand traditions correctly, make coffee for the other justices at their weekly conference to consider future Supreme Court business. He will thus be a coffee maker for three formidable women who are his new colleagues: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Elena Kagan.
I know Justice Ginsburg from all I have read, and I remember her nomination from the early days when I served in the Clinton administration. Justice Sotomayor and I went to college together and I remember helping along her first judicial appointment when I then worked for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Justice Kagan was a colleague of mine in the White House working for President Clinton.
So I feel like I know these strong, independent and fierce women. I suspect one or two of them may like beer, too, like Justice Kavanaugh. Justice Kagan liked shooting in the wilderness with Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Ginsburg loves opera, and Justice Sotomayor loves the Yankees.
We know a little about the culture and internal dynamics of the Supreme Court, and we know enough to say that the justices form friendships, personal affinities, and ways to set aside political and legal differences to allow them the relationships which immunize the Supreme Court from some of the dysfunction that affects other branches of government.
So I imagine encounters, after “Hi, Justice Kavanaugh, welcome and thanks for the coffee,” that will go to the heart of who we are and how we work together. Chief Justice John Roberts will set the tone, and his colleagues will defer. But then I imagine our female justices taking up a role and, without ever being explicit, counseling the new justice on the ways the culture of the Supreme Court works. And can’t you imagine Justice Clarence Thomas sitting there, quietly nodding?
I am not suggesting that Justice Kavanaugh will be neutered by his female colleagues on the bench. But I can imagine him, now under these circumstances, listening carefully to their counsel that might go something like, “No, don’t make that case your first public dissent,” or “Stay out of this case in a strong opinion because it has elements of sexual harassment and intimidation.” Apparently, some court opinions that might rise to the supremes have exactly those dimensions.
What I am suggesting is that the three female members of the Supreme Court may be the remedy for all that will engulf our nation in the aftermath of his confirmation. They will be mentors and role models for him, even though all three will surely be on the opposite side of every contentious ruling on which Justice Kavanaugh decides.
Yet, they can teach him how to hold fast to convictions. They can show him ways to argue that do not look obsessively partisan. They can counsel him on the issue of judicial temperament, which his last appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee called into question. They can remind him how to argue passionately without forfeiting collegiality.
We need examples now of institutions in our civic life which perform and do not fall into pits of despair, polarization, and outright warfare. The Supreme Court has been one of those institutions precisely because the justices and their clerks seem to know how to work with each other and enjoy each other despite deep political and legal disagreements.
When the Supreme Court announces “oyez” and welcomes Justice Kavanaugh to the bench, the watchful eye should focus on the three women who might help their newest member overcome humiliation and skepticism to turn him into a justice of which America will be proud.

0,10/04/18 04:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/409921-american-statesmanship-is-not-dead,American statesmanship is not dead,"Extreme partisanship, we are often told, is the new normal. Americans are sorting into clusters of the same opinions, we choose our media diets so that discordant views never enter our partisan echo chambers, and the major political parties have gotten so adept at gerrymandering that, in essence, our representatives choose us rather than the other way around.
There is much truth to these charges, unfortunately, but they miss something very important about the American people: Most of us do not conform fully to the political agenda of either party. While the simple satisfaction of tribal purity seemingly rules the day, our success as a country requires leaders who are brave enough to forge the consensus our Founding Fathers made necessary in the blueprint of our government.
Unfortunately, our current system rewards politicians who appeal to narrow partisan constituencies that demand ideological rigidity. This wins elections. In the last two decades, the number of “swing” districts that are likely to shift from one Congress to the next has fallen by two-thirds. Is it any wonder bipartisanship have largely disappeared on Capitol Hill?
With these broken incentives, dysfunction is baked into the system. Politicians in both parties run for election with seemingly bold proposals to fix major issues, such as aging infrastructure and ballooning debt, that never seem to make it into law. The American people see this failure, along with the inability of Congress to execute even the basic functions of government such as passing timely budgets, and they grow even more discouraged. That disillusionment explains why a majority of Americans have little or no confidence in Congress or in either of the major parties.
At the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, we have launched a Commission on Civility and Effective Governance. Our commissioners, including former elected officials from both parties, executive branch officials, political advocates, and business leaders, have spent decades thinking about what constrains lawmakers and shapes their behavior for better and worse. We are developing recommendations for political reforms that make government more responsive to the needs of its citizens, and rewards politicians for pragmatism over partisanship.
Our recommendations will promote the kinds of changes our country needs to get government working for the American people rather than for partisans. The challenge we face is that the people we need to implement those changes are our current elected officials, who have been rewarded by our current system. That it is so important to recognize politicians who, even in this dysfunctional dynamic, are practicing the civic virtues which we hold dear. This month we are honoring Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Governor John Kasich of Ohio for their willingness to look beyond party in search of pragmatic yet effective solutions in their states and their advocacy for bipartisanship across the country.
These governors on opposite sides of the aisle understand how choices made Washington directly impact the lives of people in their diverse states. They have worked together to advocate for health care reforms that stabilize insurance markets, increase coverage, and control cost. They have demanded trade policy that looks forward to promote an innovative economy and relief for people hurt by escalating tariffs.
Most importantly, both have taken a proactive stance against gerrymandering. In Colorado, Governor Hickenlooper is supporting a ballot initiative to amend the state constitution to prohibit partisan gerrymandering. Governor Kasich has called for reform of redistricting in Ohio that passed in the state legislature and a ballot initiative earlier this year. Both initiatives seek to promote bipartisanship and compromise in one of the most highly charged political process issues we face.
These are exactly the kinds of hard choices that we should be encouraging. It is difficult to overstate the power that partisans wield when drawing district boundaries for seats in Congress. The American political system thrives instead when good citizens place country above party. Redistricting reform alone will not solve all the problems we face, nor will two state governors reaching across the aisle. But this is an essential first step. Governors Kasich and Hickenlooper are doing crucial work to ensure that our democracy truly reflects the will of the people.
The award the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress will be giving Governors Hickenlooper and Kasich is called the “Publius Award.” Publius was the pen name that Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay used when writing the Federalist Papers, the collection of essays supporting the adoption of the Constitution.
They had wildly different political views, but they came together to advocate for the reforms that created the country we live in today. They knew that a democratic system that required compromise was the best safeguard of liberty in a country as large and fractious as ours, and the best assurance that politicians served the broadest good for the citizens. More than 230 years later, we are proud to see leaders who still do.

’s speech at the U.N. General Assembly made little mention of democracy, human rights and rule of law — traditional American values — except to attack the U.N. Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court.
This was a lost opportunity to use a global platform to address creeping authoritarianism around the globe that threatens not only American security but also U.S. companies in their operations abroad. 
Authoritarianism is on the rise globally, in places previously thought safe for democracy. The nonprofit CIVICUS ranks the space for non-profit organizations to operate — “civic space” — and notes that it continues to close around the globe, with not only China and Hungary, but also Belgium and the Netherlands, recently downgraded in the rankings.
Simultaneously, attacks on individuals defending human rights and the environment are increasing, including in global supply chains.
Attacks on civil society are a harbinger of growing repression and eroding rule of law — the canary in the coal mine. When the dissenting voices are silenced, this enables corruption in all its forms to flourish, leading to kleptocracy and politically influenced courts.
This is not only extremely bad news for human rights defenders, it is bad for responsible business. Business is playing a role in fighting this creeping authoritarianism and has a vested long-term interest in doing so. U.S. foreign policy should reflect this. 
Western companies have spent decades developing robust management systems to function responsibly and in accordance with laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Companies also increasingly commit to respect human rights, as articulated in global standards such as the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Meeting such commitments is highly challenging, however, in repressive environments. Meanwhile, less savory businesses from authoritarian and corrupt states are well-prepared to adapt and flourish in such ecosystems, and Western business finds it hard to compete. 
Now, companies are engaging publicly to protect civic space and maintain an ecosystem in which they can operate responsibly, as outlined in a new report by the Business and Human Rights Resource Center.
A consortium of American footwear and apparel companies wrote to the Cambodian government, criticizing a crackdown on workers in their supply chains who were seeking a higher minimum wage.
After the Cambodian government moved to shutter the independent press, companies sent further letters declaring that an active and independent civil society and press was in the interest of business.
In Germany, CEOs of major brands such as BMW and Daimler have engaged with their employees to combat xenophobia and racism after far-right riots against immigrants erupted in eastern Germany.
Daimler’s CEO tweeted, “Everyone of us is now called upon to stand united against radicalization. Because radicalization has never solved any problem.”
An array of U.S. companies with activities in Myanmar (Burma) made public statements condemning Myanmar’s international crimes against the Rohingya minority in an effort to change the government’s actions, with some initiating boycotts of the country’s products.
As these examples show, business can provide a vital voice at a time of rising authoritarianism and should continue to speak out on behalf of embattled civil society and democracy. But business cannot take the place of a vibrant U.S. foreign policy that supports our fundamental values. 
The Trump administration has shown little appetite for integrating human rights and other traditional American values into its foreign policy, preferring a transactional, realpolitik approach. But is that approach really what’s best for the United States?
The administration should incorporate human rights into its foreign policy because it’s the right thing to do. But if that is not sufficient reason, it should do so because it helps maintain a democratic ecosystem.
Respect for human rights and rule of law across the globe not only helps to counter Russian and Chinese influence and strengthen U.S. security but also ensures that American companies flourish in the long run.
Where these values are under siege, this imposes real costs not only to democratic principles but also to responsible business. Human rights and democratic values are our country’s competitive advantage on the world stage.

0,09/30/18 10:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/409167-kavanaugh-polling-fbi-on-the-hot-seat,Kavanaugh polling: FBI on the hot seat,"Americans believe Christine Blasey Ford. And most also believe Brett Kavanaugh. Given this state of affairs, it’s the FBI investigation that has the most promise to settle the debate on whether Kavanaugh should be confirmed after what most voters see as a process that has degenerated into a national disgrace.
If the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges, 60 percent believe that Kavanaugh should then be confirmed, according to a weekend Harvard CAPS/Harris poll of 1,330 registered voters. Sen. Jeff Flake
(R-Ariz.), feeling rather directly the corrosive split within the nation, has the support of the country in insisting upon a brief and limited FBI investigation before the final vote. Sixty-six percent of Americans support that decision, and that includes 80 percent of Democrats, 69 percent of independents but only 45 percent of Republicans. GOP voters were ready for a vote now, and overwhelmingly back the confirmation without further delay.
The testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh had a powerful but not decisive effect on the public. Huge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it, and 40 percent thought she alone was credible, 23 percent thought just Kavanaugh was, and 27 percent said both were believable. Read together, the poll findings indicate that 67 percent found her credible and 50 percent found him to be so. Even President Donald Trump
said her testimony was “compelling.”
But the credibility of their testimony does not appear to be the decisive factor. Rather, the question comes down to corroboration as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should ascend to the high court. In terms of the overall needle, after the testimony was heard, 37 percent say confirm the nomination, 44 percent say reject it, and 18 percent remain undecided, with Democrats going one way and Republicans the other. But once the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation, this shifts to 57 percent who favor confirmation — and that goes up to 60 percent, if the FBI agrees there is no corroboration. Remember, because there is no specific “where” or “when” in Ford’s allegation, Kavanaugh cannot establish an alibi — and that’s why corroboration of other facts is so critical.
Given that only the two principals testified on national TV, the information that potential witnesses denied any knowledge was not front-and-center nor as credible without an independent determination that sustains those facts. Without question, if the FBI does find collaborating facts, Kavanaugh would be gone. Either way, FBI Director Chris Wray will now be on the hot seat. Hopefully this will work out better than the last time the country waited for the FBI.
Underlying this battle for the nomination is a political battle, and 69 percent agree with Kavanaugh’s pronouncement and Sen. Lindsey Graham
’s (R-S.C.) statement that the proceedings have been a “national disgrace.” Sen. Feinstein definitely is in the crosshairs, with 75 percent believing she should have turned over Ford’s letter months earlier so that this debacle might have been avoided. Graham has raised some serious questions about the actions of Ford’s lawyers and Feinstein’s legal referral, too.
No one, clearly, is winning the partisan battle today — if anything, both parties are losing. Men, by 62 percent, say Democrats are to blame while women, by 57 percent, say Republicans are to blame for the partisanship they are seeing. And, without doubt, this fight is likely to energize turnout in the midterms, with 45 percent saying they are more likely to vote as a result of the confirmation battle. So far, Democrats have a slight edge in building voter energy.
Also without question, attitudes towards confirmation are divided by party, with 72 percent of Republicans favoring immediate confirmation; that figure rises to 86 percent if there is a favorable FBI report. Democrats are dug in as well and, even after an FBI investigation that would fail to corroborate Ford, 60 percent still would oppose Kavanaugh. It’s the independents who can be swung over by the added element of a supplemental FBI background check.
Despite the close national numbers on which party is to blame for this morass, the strong partisanship that’s been brought to the fore means that Democratic senators in red states may have some tough sledding if they oppose this nomination; the numbers in states like West Virginia or Indiana are likely to highly favor the Republican position on Kavanaugh.
Of course, if Democrats are unhappy with the FBI’s results, they will simply call it inadequate and seek to muddy the waters. The attorneys for Ford already have taken that position, and it is likely to be echoed by Democrats. This will put Sens. Chris Coons
(D-Del.) and Flake in a difficult position, because their compromise was to order a weeklong investigation — and that’s what the majority of the public backed in the poll. The issue for Coons is whether he will back the results or his bipartisanship will be short-lived.
Ultimately the public expects that the FBI will come back with little that’s new and 63 percent expect that the nomination will be approved. Of course, very little so far has gone as expected in this confirmation battle and there are no doubt more twists and turns ahead.

(I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) have been able to sell the false notion that our economic system is rigged and that the pain caused by the Great Recession was the result of corporate greed and exploitation.
Lost in all of this is the fact that government policy to make home ownership available to all was the predicate for subsequent corporate irresponsibility.
None the less, the Great Recession led to a greater focus on income and wealth inequality, which have gotten worse in recent years.
Until recently, wages for middle- and low-income Americans have been growing more slowly, college graduates are being saddled with large educational debt, good jobs seem to be fewer, and there is pessimism about the current generation being better off economically than their parents. Growing pessimism about the future has replaced optimism. Criticism of capitalism has increased substantially.
In a 2014 opinion piece in the New York Times, Tyler Cower, a professor at George Mason University, made the following point:
“The message from groups like Occupy Wall Street has been that inequality is up and that capitalism is failing us. A more correct and nuanced message is this: Although significant economic problems remain, we have been living in equalizing times for the world — a change that has been largely for the good. That may not make for convincing sloganeering, but it’s the truth.”
The 2016 presidential race gave Bernie Sanders the platform to promote “democratic socialism” and awaken millions of millennials from political apathy. It’s not clear what democratic socialism is, but it has been conflated with socialism.
Young people see socialism as superior to free-market capitalism as reflected in polling data. Those who like socialism ignore how capitalism has eliminated many of mankind’s worst problems, such as pestilence and gross hunger and poverty while providing a strong record of economic growth and advances in technology. Socialism has accomplished just the opposite. 
The one explanation for the disconnect between polling data and facts is that capitalism is being evaluated against a nonexistent utopia that will provide free education, universal health care and equality of incomes, all without exploding the national debt or cratering the economy.
The reality is quite different. Estimates of the 10-year costs of these freebies is staggering — $42 trillion, or twice the current national debt. Before all of this could happen, Margaret Thatcher's observation that, “Pretty soon you run out of other people’s money” would cause the brakes to be applied. 
When it is pointed out to advocates of socialism that all past attempts have failed — Russia/Soviet Union, Venezuela and Cuba, for example — they revert to claiming that their model is similar to Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Denmark.
The advocates confuse socialism with what is actually known as social democracy, wherein the government promotes a welfare agenda through taxation and spending, using market-based economics to generate wealth.
In those nations, the means of production are privately owned — 90 percent in Sweden for example — not state-owned.
This was made clear by the prime minister of Denmark, who, in a speech at the Kennedy School of Government said, ""I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy."" 
While advocates might concede definitional misstatements, they also will no doubt contend that Scandinavian countries are better off. They can point to universal health care, free college tuition and a generous safety net as evidence that we should be more like Denmark or Norway.
Superficial comparisons are dangerous and misleading. Trying to compare Denmark and Sweden to the United States is analogous to using the turning radius of a speed boat to draw inference about turning a cruise liner. 
Trump Spanish-language ad equates progressives, socialists
GOP planning 'surprise factor' each night of convention, officials say
The so-called Nordic model works in these small countries — Denmark’s population is 5.7 million; Sweden’s is 8.9 million — because of a culture with strong emphasis on work and individual responsibility combined with homogenous populations and the wealth-creation of capitalism.
The solution to many of the problems that the critics of capitalism cite is not to make the government even more powerful but to reverse the growth in crony capitalism that spreads because of the symbiotic relationship between legislators, regulators and business leaders who use their wealth to bias the system. As Winston Churchill remarked, ""Capitalism is the worst form of government, save all others.""

Framework Convention on Climate Change) or the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals.
The ambition and scale of these programs cries out for involvement, investment and leadership from the private sector.
So why, at a moment when governments and international organizations should be actively seeking ways to encourage business to step up, is the private sector being accused of having a “conflict of interest” or of actively seeking to upend global consensus? 
Global policymakers are being urged by some governments, activist groups and U.N. staff to freeze out the private sector from meaningful engagement in key international deliberations.
These calls have come in the context of the U.N. climate talks, at the World Health Organization and in numerous other intergovernmental forums. They reflect a deep misunderstanding of the profit motive, the nature of innovation and the importance of markets in catalyzing action toward shared goals. 
Broadly speaking, the “myths” about business influence and the role of the private sector fall into six distinct categories. Let’s dispel them one by one.
Myth 1: Since business seeks profit, its interests are inherently at odds with the public interest. 
Businesses cannot succeed in societies that fail, and businesses have a direct stake in secure, healthy, prospering communities and customers. Successful businesses create jobs, pay taxes to national treasuries and provide for needs and wants of consumers.
Businesses that are not making profits are much less likely to invest in innovation and other necessary sustainability related policies and actions. 
Myth 2: Business involvement in inter-governmental deliberations must be “managed” as a “risk.” 
Over the years, more and more actors from across society have become involved in the U.N.’s climate and sustainability debates. This is a good thing. In response, international bodies have taken steps to address concerns about conflict of interest for all groups, including the private sector.
However, assuming ill-intent on the part of one of these parties — the private sector — discourages business involvement and engagement. 
Myth 3: Having business organizations in the room results in “undue influence” and “interference” with policy outcomes.
Well-designed, effective and efficient policies depend on well-informed policymakers. For this reason, involvement of business technical expertise and real-world experience is a critical element throughout international sustainability deliberations. It helps to identify challenges, define solutions, carry out policies and assess the effectiveness of actions.
Myth 4: Business is unaccountable and operates in a non-transparent manner, and it must therefore divulge confidential information.
Business is subject to abundant government oversight and legal requirements at the national level, and it faces intense scrutiny from investors and other entities. Moreover, many companies provide additional reporting about their environmental, social and economic policies, practices and performance.
In short, business organizations and their members are already among the most “transparent” interests involved in inter-governmental forums.
Myth 5: Business has a disproportionate influence in the U.N. already, crowding out other important interests.
In most U.N. forums, all stakeholder groups are subject to similar requirements for accreditation, registration and participation. There is no preferential access accorded to business.
In general, business organizations are just one grouping among numerous interests that also represent labor, women, youth, gender minorities, indigenous peoples, local authorities and others — and they are usually in the minority in terms of numbers of representatives.
In fact, at many U.N. forums, business representation is so restricted that it discourages smaller companies and entrepreneurs from developing countries from participating.
Myth 6: Business-funded research is inherently biased and thus unacceptable as a basis for policy making. 
Businesses have significant cutting-edge research, technical and innovation resources at their disposal and regularly work in partnership with academic, scientific and U.N. entities on cooperative research.
Innovators, engineers and researchers from the business community are a deep talent pool and important resource as governments design systems-oriented policy responses.
Policies and actions to prioritize and respond to sustainability challenges should be based on the fullest scientific and technical information and reviews, and no peer-reviewed credible source should be ignored.
Where multilateral forums arbitrarily disqualify or dismiss private-sector sources, they subtract important information and findings. 
Tackling these myths is important now, because private-sector support and participation is essential if we want concerted global action to achieve the desired results.
What’s more, disregarding input and insight from one sector of society in the context of U.N. deliberations runs contrary to principles of effective governance and stakeholder consultation that the most effective national governments pursue at home. 
In short, business needs to be at the table because business is part of the solution.

0,09/24/18 02:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/408079-40-years-later-trump-can-learn-from-camp-david-accords,"40 years later, Camp David Accords hold many lessons for Trump","September 17 marked the 40th anniversary of the historic Camp David Accords brokered by President Jimmy Carter between Israel and Egypt, who had fought five wars since the Jewish state’s creation in 1948.
In one of the greatest acts of presidential diplomacy in American history, Carter helped create a framework for Israeli security that has lasted for two generations and greatly enhanced U.S. national security interests.
If Donald Trump
is serious about forging a peace between Israel and the Palestinians, as his administration has stated, he’d do well to study Carter’s playbook.     
The path to Camp David was circuitous. Deeply schooled in the history of the Holy Land due to his Baptist roots, but a neophyte in international diplomacy, Carter was determined to make peace in the Middle East his top foreign policy priority.
To do this, he needed to balance the personalities and conflicting views of two leaders who deeply distrusted each other: Menachem Begin, Israel’s first Likud prime minister, and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
At first, Carter stumbled. In October 1977, the president announced in a joint-communique with the Soviet Union the reconvening of the long-stalled Geneva Conference that sought to create a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel, all its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians.
The Israelis and the Egyptians were not consulted in advance about the communique. The Jewish community in the U.S. and Israel were horrified by the thought of Israel facing over 20 hostile Arab states and the pro-Arab Soviets. 
Sadat’s surprise, courageous decision to fly to Jerusalem a month after the Geneva process collapsed was born out of his recognition that he would never regain the entire Egyptian Sinai if hardline Arab leaders held a veto over any comprehensive deal.
He pledged to the Knesset “no more wars,” after his country and Israel had already fought five. But months of direct negotiations between Begin’s camp and Sadat’s diplomats stalled.
Carter wisely pivoted, abandoning his dream of a single comprehensive settlement for one focused on a formal peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and self-government for the Palestinians.
Carter subsequently summoned the two leaders to the presidential retreat at Camp David in rural Maryland, against the wishes of his top, and risk-averse advisors. Carter prepared for the summit with the intensity of a lawyer, which he was not, and the zealousness of a Baptist Sunday school teacher, which he was.
He scrutinized reams of CIA intelligence reports to understand the red lines of each side, met with high-level Israeli and Arab ambassadors, and regularly commiserated with Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon’s secretary of state who had conducted his own shuttle diplomacy in pursuit of Mideast peace. 
Camp David proved to be an endurance test for Carter. For 13 agonizing days, he personally helped draft more than 20 proposed peace agreements, often with little or no sleep. He had to negotiate separately with Begin and Sadat because they refused to be in the same room.
The president needed to provide personal inducements and appeal to Begin’s and Sadat’s more humane sides to keep the process going. On the first Sunday at Camp David, Carter took Begin and Sadat in his presidential limousine to the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg to remind the two men of the costs of continued conflict.
On numerous occasions, the process neared collapse. On the last Sunday, Begin announced he could make no further comprises and was leaving Camp David. Carter, understanding the disastrous consequences of failure to Sadat, the Mideast and himself, appealed to the Begin to stay.
Knowing Begin’s love for his grandchildren, Carter personally inscribed photographs of himself with Begin and Sadat to each of the Israeli prime minister’s eight grandchildren and personally delivered them to his cabin.
Carter watched as Begin emotionally read each of his grandchildren’s names, and with tears in his eyes, told the president he would make one last try. An agreement was finally reached at the 11th hour, though Begin stressed the accords still needed to be approved.
The accords were only a framework, not a binding treaty, so the process dragged on for six long months. Carter, over the unanimous opposition of his advisers, pursued a shuttle diplomacy across the Mideast to try and seal the deal.
Up until the final hours, Begin would not agree, but on March 14, 1979, the deal was completed with a surprise visit by Begin to Carter's suite at the King David Hotel. For 40 years, it has never been violated, and now Egypt and Israel, despite a cold peace, share sensitive intelligence and a common commitment to fight terrorist groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. 
The relationship between Israel and the Palestinians remains the unfished chapter of Camp David. Carter was a visionary on this front, being the first American president to call for “Palestinian homeland.”
But this stance cost him his standing with the American Jewish community, and he regularly butted heads with Begin over the issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which Carter believed were illegal.
Begin committed at Camp David to provide full autonomy to the Palestinians within five years and to abide by a settlement freeze in disputed areas, although the length of the freeze was disputed. But talks stalled, and since 1979, Jewish settlers in the West Bank has grown to 350,000 from 15,000. 
The Trump administration is working hard on its own peace plan, vowing to present it after the midterm elections. But Carter’s diplomacy at Camp David underscores just how difficult a viable peace will be for Donald Trump to achieve.
Carter’s victory was only attained through exhaustive preparation, even-handedness and creativity and sustained and direct presidential involvement. Conversely, the Trump administration has recently decided to cut aid to the Palestinian authority and shutter its offices in Washington, which hardly augurs well for earning their trust. 
The Trump administration has been among the most pro-Israel in U.S. history. This affords it credibility with Israeli leaders to build on what Jimmy Carter created 40 years ago. But to do so, Trump will need to demand painful compromises from both sides. I hope he will do so.

0,09/24/18 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/408063-why-arent-liberals-fun-anymore,Why aren't liberals fun anymore?,"Several months ago, the very night the Stormy Daniels story broke, I appeared on Don Lemon’s show on CNN. The producer told the guests a few minutes before we went on air that Lemon wanted our reaction to the Daniels allegations. The first guest said something trite about how “she may be doing this to call attention to herself, but we have to treat these charges against Trump very seriously.” Next, Lemon turned to me for my reaction. I really had no opinion about this story, so I just blurted out the first thing that popped into my head: “Gee, Don, who would have ever thought a stripper would want to call attention to herself?”
Now, if you are a normal person, you probably at least laugh a little or smile about that line. But the video went viral on YouTube because the other three guests, all liberals, and Lemon sat stone faced when I said that. They didn’t crack even the slightest hint of a smile. There was just a long awkward silence until I finally said, “Hello, that’s a joke.”
The point of this story is that liberals just don’t have a sense of humor anymore. The rage that the left feels now about President Trump
, tax cuts, conservatives, Brett Kavanaugh and more has become so all consuming that it has made many liberals miserable to be around.
Consider the statement by Sen. Mazie Hirono
(D-Hawaii), who lashed out last week at her Republican colleagues regarding the sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh: “Guess who is perpetrating all of these kinds of actions? It’s the men in this country. I just want to say to the men in this country: Just shut up and step up.” It’s not just that she said it, but she now wears this nastiness as a badge of honor. She even received a standing ovation in the Capitol the other day from abortion activists.
Similarly, the ugly incident when White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was kicked out of a restaurant weeks ago wasn’t an aberration. Liberals are so filled with a sense of moral superiority and rage that they literally don’t want to sit in the same dining room with us.
Last week, I gave a talk at the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley to some 250 technology executives and the venture capitalists who fund them. I asked at the start of my speech how many of them have a positive opinion of Trump. Now, mind you, if any group has been transformed into gazillionaires because of Trump policies, it was this crowd. Out of the 250 attendees, about three people dared to raise their hands. I knew that liberalism is transcendent in the Bay Area, but I didn’t realize groupthink was this lopsided.
After the speech, about 20 to 30 of the attendees came up and said they enjoyed my talk. Several whispered that they really like what Trump is doing. Huh? Why didn’t they raise their hands? The answers: “I have clients here and I will lose them if they know I support Trump;"" ""I will be ostracized if my friends know my real feelings;"" ""I didn’t want to get into an argument with people;” and so on.
The sad irony is that it is liberals who are running the sanctimonious and moralistic crusades to end bullying in America. Yet, apparently, there are just some views that aren’t worth tolerating. A conservative friend of mine always uses a line about liberals hating Trump more than they love America. It would be one thing to hate Trump if his policies were failing, as liberals unanimously believed would happen. But, lo, we now are nearing the end of 2018 as one of the most prosperous periods in modern times, and that has only further infuriated Trump haters. 
Perhaps it is just human nature to hate the one who keeps proving you wrong. Some are like comedian and talk show host Bill Maher, who admits he wants millions of Americans to lose their jobs, so that we can get rid of Trump. Yes, that’s just what this country needs now, a little more misery.
The economic boom is now palpable to nearly all Americans. It transcends spin. Polls are showing that Trump is unpopular, but Americans are upbeat about the economy. Consumers are spending like there’s no tomorrow. That is what is so disconcerting about liberal rage. They are bitterly unhappy at the very moment that the American economy is as prosperous as at anytime in modern history, and when median family incomes just hit an all time high, when black and Hispanic unemployment have hit record lows. What’s so bad about feeling good?
What a difference a generation makes. It used to be conservatives who were the stuffy ones. Liberals were the fun ones to be around. Now the ones who are so uptight are the liberals like actor Jeff Bridges, who once was funny but now is so embarrassed by modern day America that he seems to want to be anywhere on this planet, except here. OK, then, just go! Liberals are making it clearer with each passing day that they don’t want to associate with conservatives any longer. As a conservative, I hate to say it, but more and more the feeling is mutual.

0,09/12/18 09:15 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/406096-us-joins-ranks-of-middle-east-with-fierce-identity-politics,National identity crisis makes the US more like the Middle East,"The United States invaded Iraq in 2003, arguing that it intended to replace Saddam Hussein with a friendly democratic regime.
Fifteen years later, this goal does not appear to be in sight. Iraq only recently beat back an Islamic State onslaught that included the prolonged occupation of the northern city of Mosul.
Parliamentary elections in May still have still not yielded a functioning government; the dominant foreign influence in that country is not the U.S. but Iran, whose meddling is nonetheless highly resented by many Iraqis.
The underlying problem in Iraq is the absence of any sense of overarching national identity. There is no entity called Iraq to which citizens feel loyalty, in preference to their ethnic group, sect, region or tribe.
This lack of an integrative identity has fueled not just violence but also pervasive corruption: The moment a politician gets into office, he or she feels entitled to steal on behalf of that smaller group in what devolves into a zero-sum contest over resources.
Iraq is only one example of state failure resulting from weak national identity. Within the greater Middle East, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Afghanistan have been embroiled in civil wars as a result of out-of-control identity politics.
An Iraqi politician of long experience told me that, after the invasion in 2003, Americans were constantly advising Iraqis to put aside their sectarian and ethnic differences and to seek greater national unity. Today, he somewhat mischievously throws that advice back in the faces of the Americans he knows.
Instead of ""Americanizing"" the Middle East, he notes, the U.S. has become increasingly ""Middle Easternized."" The polarization of American society is so extreme that the Republican and Democratic parties resemble warring tribes that see each other as existential threats.
A large number of Republicans seem to regard loyalty to the person of Donald Trump
as more important than their commitment to any higher goals like the rule of law or preservation of democracy internationally.
The Democratic Party, for its part, has shifted away from the broad class-based coalitions of the New Deal and Great Society to advocacy on behalf of its component identity groups: African-Americans, women, the LGBT community and the like.
It is of course too facile to say that the U.S. is becoming a Middle Eastern country: We are thankfully not anywhere near the levels of violent hatred that characterize Iraq or Syria.
But our politics become Middle Eastern-like the moment we begin thinking that the fixed characteristics with which we are born — race, ethnicity, gender, religion, etc. — ought to determine the way we think and act, not just about politics but across culture more generally.
If there is a single lesson to be learned from the contemporary Middle East, it is that national identity is critical to the success of any political system. That identity needs to be liberal and inclusive, encompassing a country’s de facto diversity. But it also needs to be substantive.
Such was the “creedal” identity that had evolved in the U.S. by the late 20th century: America was not to be defined by race or ethnicity but by political ideas such as loyalty to the Constitution, the rule of law and belief in the fundamental law of human equality.
This creedal identity had seemed to be an accomplished fact prior to the rise of Donald Trump. The president has legitimated a new generation of right-wing identitarians who would drag the country back into an ethnic definition of what it means to be an American.
But it is challenged as well by people on the left who don’t believe that immigrants need to be assimilated to such an overarching identity or who think that the latter is necessarily associated with bigotry and exclusion.
A creedal identity can be fostered by the way we teach civics to young people, something that has been seriously neglected in our education system in recent decades. It could also be bolstered by a program of national service, based on the idea that citizens are not simply rights-bearers, but also have duties to support the common good.
A properly-managed system of national service would also help to cut across barriers of race, ethnicity and class, just as military service does today.
But in the end, national identity is sustained by the stories that Americans tell about themselves, and whether these stories emphasize what they hold in common as well as what makes them different.
This integrative narrative has never been put forward in many Middle Eastern countries, and they are paying the price.

0,09/11/18 09:30 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/405948-opposition-to-the-president-is-not-treason,Opposition to the president is not treason,"POTUS ≠ US. It is a simple formula. If President Trump
and his core supporters would internalize it, they’d be well served.
The presidency of the United States is the most significant, most powerful single office in our constitutional government. But, all the same, the president is a public servant. He is not the sovereign; we are. He represents the nation; he does not embody it.
Consequently, a betrayal of the president’s trust is not a betrayal of the country. It is dangerous to confound these two things.
The president is extremely agitated about an anonymous New York Times op-ed, penned by what the Gray Lady describes as “a senior official in the Trump administration.” I don’t blame him. The piece, in which the author brags about being part of a faction resisting the president from within, is dishonorable.
For an executive officer with integrity, there is a simple choice. If you object to the policies of an administration, or if you find the character of the president so objectionable that you have difficulty carrying out his directives, you can either (a) remain in the administration, do your best to veer the president toward policies you believe are in the nation’s interest, and then faithfully execute his lawful directives regardless of whether you agree with them; or (b) resign your position and engage in the public debate — in your own name, not in craven anonymity.
The official who authored the op-ed took the coward’s way out. He or she did not just betray the president. To the extent this self-serving preen has prompted a predictable presidential tirade and internal investigation, the author also has betrayed the selfless, patriotic administration officials who, every day, work diligently to govern and to pursue America’s best interests.
Moreover, the author has confirmed the indictment long lodged by Trump supporters: There is an entrenched “deep state” working against the president. Euphemizing it as the “steady state,” as Anonymous does, fails to camouflage the nature of the “Resistance.” And posturing about how the “steady state” beats back the president’s worst impulses does not conceal its imperious claim to be a permanent, unaccountable regime.
If the administration identifies the writer, he or she should be fired forthwith (whereupon the writer’s inevitable media beatification can commence). And if, as Anonymous claims, there are administration operatives who see themselves as a parallel government working to thwart the elected one — as opposed to seasoned subject-matter experts who strive to ensure that the president makes informed decisions (the kind of people every administration needs) — they should get the boot, too.
All that said, though, betrayal of the president is not betrayal of the nation.
No sooner was the op-ed published than President Trump tweeted, “TREASON?” He proceeded to rant that, “for National Security purposes,” the Times was obliged to “turn [the author] over to the government at once!” Continuing to beat the “national security” drum, the president contends that the Justice Department should use its awesome investigative powers to ferret out the identity of the author.
Some of the president’s most rabid supporters have picked up this batty baton and run with it. They claim that the op-ed author has committed treason. Anonymous and his or her deep-state cronies, they say, are guilty of sedition and must be prosecuted — what is Attorney General Jeff Sessions
waiting for?
This is crazy talk. There was no classified information compromised by the op-ed. It is an expression of political dissent. There is nothing criminal about it and it is not the business of the Justice Department.
As noted on Twitter this weekend, I happen to be one of a few people in our country who has prosecuted a seditious conspiracy case (specifically, against the jihadist cabal that, in 1993, bombed the World Trade Center and unsuccessfully plotted simultaneous attacks on New York City landmarks — see my memoir, “Willful Blindness”). The crime, based on a Civil War-era statute now codified at Section 2384 of the federal penal code, rarely has been invoked in our history because it is so heinous. It involves conspiring to levy war against the United States, or to attempt the forcible overthrow of the government. The sine qua non of the offense is the intent to take up arms against our country.
Seditious conspiracy is derived from treason, the only federal crime to be defined by the Constitution. It is no surprise, then, that treason (codified at Section 2381) involves the concept of aligning with enemies at war with our nation. Note, that means enemies of the United States, not of Donald Trump, poised to wage a real war, not a metaphorical war, much less a mere political attack.
Understand: Traitors and seditionists have sought to demolish our democratic republic by mass-murder attacks and all-out war. Such malevolent actors are the enemies of all Americans. To the contrary, political adversaries of the elected government are our fellow citizens engaged in dissent, without which a functioning free society would be an illusion.
It is ludicrous to trivialize treason and sedition as if they were mere political dissent. I opined in my tweet that the past week’s lunatic chatter has “an icky cult vibe.” It does. If you can’t distinguish opposition to the president from opposition to the country, you’re a cultist.
To be clear, I am supportive of the president when he promotes conservative policies (as he often does). I am also convinced that the special-counsel investigation to which Mr. Trump has been subjected is ill-founded. But those who disagree with me, those who vigorously oppose President Trump and his agenda — whether they are administration officials, media pundits, or partisan Democrats on the floor of Congress — are engaged in a proud American tradition safeguarded by the First Amendment.
Many people on both sides of the political divide complain that our discourse is broken. It won’t be repaired until we stop portraying our political opponents as treasonous enemies; and until each side unambiguously condemns activists of any stripe who cross the line from legitimate dissent into violence and the techniques of disruption that make civil discourse impossible.
Time to get a grip.

0,09/10/18 03:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/405879-nationalists-announce-their-arrival-in-swedish-election,Election verifies the rise of Swedish nationalists,"Sweden held general parliamentary elections on Sunday, and preliminary results confirmed a big change in the political landscape from liberal ideals toward a more nationalist, populist agenda.
The Social Democratic party, Sweden’s largest party whose ideals have dominated Swedish politics for most of the last 100 years, got their weakest result since 1908.
This is significant; one could describe the founding fathers of the modern Swedish society as Social Democrats, and Sweden stands as the model case of the Nordic welfare state.
The biggest winner of this election were the Sweden Democrats, a populist party whose program has a strong focus on nationalism and social conservatism. They have been able to rally people who fear immigrant crime and oppose a change in the national fabric of Swedish society.
The party also wants to hold a referendum on Sweden's European Union membership along the lines of the Brexit vote in the U.K. Despite a clear victory, Sweden Democrats seem to have gained less than one-fifth of votes and remain the third-largest party.
Swedish government has traditionally been run by a Social Democrat-led centre-left coalition or a centre-right coalition including a number of parties. Victory for the Sweden Democrats means that neither of these blocks got anything close to a parliamentary majority.
All traditional parties have shunned cooperation with Sweden Democrats, which makes the government formation unusually difficult. Meanwhile, next-door in Finland, the populist True Finns party was included in the center-right government in 2016.
Since then, the party has split into two groups and lost popularity. Taking responsibility comes with a price for most populists, but this does not seem to be the way for Sweden.
The head of the Sweden Democrats, Jimmie Åkesson, has tried to cleanse the party of its far-right thuggish roots, but they still differ from their Finnish cousins with a more openly xenophobic past, which makes them less acceptable partners for mainstream parties.
Whatever parties the new Swedish government will include, the government has to seek parliamentary support outside its own base and take the populist agenda more seriously.
The rise of Sweden Democrats has not been obvious to the establishment; otherwise, the phenomenon would have been taken more seriously. After all, the rise of populist parties is old news in Europe. There is one crucial difference with Sweden: Populism is rising despite of strong economic performance and good employment.
Granted, the fall of national icons like Saab cars has left some disappointed and forced to look for new jobs, but consumer confidence is high, and trust in national institutions is solid compared to most other countries.
There are other reasons for disappointment among Swedes, like hours spent languishing in national health-care queues. Most importantly, a huge number of refugees were admitted in 2016, and demographic change has been visible for decades already.
Nearly one in four inhabitants of Sweden has either been born abroad or has been born in Sweden to two parents who themselves have both been born abroad. Most of them are well-integrated, but crime committed by immigrants was one of the major themes of the general election.
According to the most recent official survey from 2005, foreign-born Swedes are more than twice as likely to be suspects in criminal investigations. Immigrants are usually younger and less educated, however, and controlling for these factors, statistics show that there is no clear evidence of major cultural criminal tendencies.
Crime rates in Sweden are very low, but the country has fallen in some international safety rankings like the Global Peace Index. Statistics do not convince everyone, and many think that the government and ruling political elite in general have not been adequately tough on crime.
Sweden is an old democracy, and people's trust to the system is deep-rooted. Voters on Sunday did not doubt the Nordic welfare model, but many hesitate to let more immigrants without similar cultural traits share the system.
Parents have been happy to let their children to play outside without need for constant oversight, but a shadow of caution has grown. The coming weeks will reveal who runs the government, but Sweden Democrats are very unlikely to enter the government or make a big difference to economic policies.
Crucially, their rise is a reminder that people long for security in a time of change. Mainstream parties need to have a clear message how they supply security and how they suppress gang violence, even if they also want to steer clear from an openly xenophobic agenda.
The recent fall in the value of the kroner, Sweden's currency, partly reflects the investor fear that Swedish politics would come to a stalemate.

0,09/10/18 09:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/405830-democracy-is-alive-in-trump-era,Democracy is alive in Trump era,"I think by now it is not news that I am uncomfortable with Donald Trump as president. He is uninformed and impulsive. He confuses his personal brand with American interests and pursues the former at the expense of the latter. Skeptical? Roll the Singapore tape. He lies constantly, saying he had the biggest inaugural crowd ever, that Barack Obama
wiretapped Trump Tower, that there is no more North Korean nuclear threat, and that the Christopher Steele dossier launched the Russia “witch hunt.”
He is also the most norm busting president in history, inciting racial animus (“Mexican judge”), condemning a free press (“enemy of the people”), shielding raw bigotry (“fine people on both sides”), and contaminating multiple judicial processes (not enough space for all the quotes here). This is happening from a position whose awesome powers are limited more by voluntary norms than by law or even the Constitution.
He has damaged the worldview of the United States. A year into his presidency, confidence in American global leadership had collapsed to a mere 30 percent, down 18 points from last months of President Obama in office. Two weeks ago while visiting  Europe, I was approached at a public event by a Scandinavian who recognized me and volunteered sadly, without anger or judgment, that he had grown up in a world in which a good and powerful nation had wished his country well. “My grandchildren do not live in such a world,” he lamented.
To summarize, I fear that the Creator did not endow President Trump
with the emotional, intellectual or ethical tools to carry out the responsibilities of his office. But he is nonetheless our president. Although nine million more Americans voted for someone other than him, he polled 304 electoral votes, which was enough to carry him to victory.
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper
questions that outcome, believing that targeted Russian interference swayed the vote in key and closely contested states. His theory is plausible but unprovable, so I do not go there. The most I will concede, pending any contrary results from special counsel Robert Mueller
, is an asterisk next to the 2016 results, so I do not argue with the angry emails and tweets I receive reminding me of the “sovereign will” of the American people.
The normal brake on an unwise, unprepared or autocratic president would be the constitutional one that Alexander Hamilton and James Madison designed in the form of our Congress. A vibrant Congress, for example, would have reasserted its exclusive Article I authority to levy tariffs and checkmated the arbitrary and spiteful imposition of duties by the administration on Canadian steel under a fiction of “national security.”
But that is not Congress today. In fact, rather than check the president’s expansive use of authorities, Congress has been used to rein in, harass or obstruct elements of the executive branch that the president cannot bend to his will. Witness House Republicans when it comes to the investigation into Russian electoral interference and potential “collusion.” All of this presents those in the executive branch with a nearly insoluble dilemma. In the junior ranks of intelligence, law enforcement and the military, I have seen the current angst within our government, perhaps best summarized by one simple question from an officer: “Sir, what do I tell my people?”
The issue is magnified at more senior levels, which is the stuff of “Fear,” the new book by Bob Woodward. He has both talked to me and talked about me in some of his previous works. Woodward is thorough and comes armed with a lot of knowledge. The parallels with intelligence analysis were strong enough that I invited him to talk to my National Security Agency leadership about his craft when I was director there. Woodward sometimes stitches together data from diverse sources to create a narrative complete with recreated dialogue and, in my experience, sometimes lets dramatic license get ahead of him. Over the years, however, his overall messages have proven remarkably accurate. This is certainly my impression of his view of this White House.
Surely there are some senior officials who are happy with what the president says and does. Others just seem happy to be at the center of politics. But all evidence suggests many have to consult their conscience daily, weighing those things they can control and shape against their continued presence legitimizing and enabling those things they cannot. Many ease the tension by talking about it in their routine of unburdening and flooding of leaks that have characterized this administration.
Then, spectacularly last week, one anonymous “senior official” went full monty in a New York Times opinion about inside efforts to control an erratic and amoral president. Many judged the author as insufficiently brave and bringing down democracy. Perhaps, but in such troubled and uncharted waters, I am reluctant to judge the virtue of another. This indeed may be one of those “in emergency break glass” moments. I am more troubled by the insufficiency of this course of action. Secretive administrative warfare against an unhinged executive is not sustainable.
Public warfare might be more effective. That is why you see so many institutions and individuals now pushing against their own traditional norms, from former intelligence officials commenting on cable news to the hero commander of the Osama Bin Laden raid describing the humiliation of our country, to a former president stepping back into the political debate and media outlets obsessed with every action within the White House. All seem to be shouting the same theme, which is that what this president is doing is not normal, and we will not act like it is.
I expect even more voices in the future, not just through leaks, but with richer narratives from the likes of Gary Cohn
, H.R. McMaster, Rob Porter and others now gone from the administration. The rules of classification still apply, of course, but other norms guarding privacy and preserving candid deliberation have to be weighed against big imperatives. If the king is mad, we have a right to know. Then, of course, there will be the special counsel report. Absent truly shocking revelations, I still hold that the only way we move beyond this for our democracy is through the vote in 2020. There will be no healing if a third of Americans view it a coup to force Trump from office before the end of his term.
It is an article of faith in our democracy that the next vote for president of the United States depends on an informed electorate. This is why we allow former officials to speak their minds. This is why we welcome people like Woodward to write books. This is why we allow the New York Times to publish opinions, even anonymous ones, without fear of coercion. This is no doubt going to get uglier, but I see no other way for our nation.

During the hearings into the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, Cory Booker
(D-N.J.) announced that he would defy the Senate Judiciary Committee by releasing a nonpublic “committee confidential” document, regardless of the consequences. “This is about the closest I’ll probably ever have in my life to an ‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” he declared, recalling the memorable line spoken by Douglas in the 1960 film.
First, and foremost, the key to having a “Spartacus moment” is not to declare your own Spartacus moment. Second, you actually have to expose yourself to a lethal threat. It turned out that the document in question already had been released and Booker was informed that it was public before the hearing. However, Booker was right on one point.
The hearing procedures were questionable and this really was a Spartacus moment. It was just not the one Booker thought it was. He and other Senate Democrats have had a legitimate gripe about the unusually high percentage of material withheld from review and the unilateral use of “committee confidential” markings to control documents. It is troubling to have a largely unknown private lawyer removing hundreds of thousands of documents based on a privilege assertion that has not actually been formally made by the White House.
Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley
(R-Iowa) also had a good point about the Democrats failing to ask for the release of documents and possibly engineering the confrontation in open committee. Yet, in the end, Democrats had the better case about the hearings being substantially different from past hearings in the method and the scope of withheld material. If Democrats had the better argument, it was lost in the atmospherics of the hearing. Indeed, for those lost in the theatrics, the story of Spartacus is instructive as suggested by Booker.
In history, gladiator turned rebel Spartacus was pursued by not one but two Roman senators turned generals, Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, who wanted to be the next consul of Rome. The point of the war was not just defeating Spartacus and his gladiator army but to be the one credited with defeating him. Crassus succeeded and proclaimed his victory at Capua. Magnus, however, claimed the honor by reaching Rome first, illustrating the danger of Crassus stopping to crucify 6,000 prisoners on the road to Rome as a statement.
The Kavanaugh hearings were like watching a contest to be consul of Rome. Booker and Kamala Harris
(D-Calif.), who sat next to each other, are viewed as leading contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Like their Roman predecessors, they knew that whoever slayed or injured Kavanaugh would be a celebrated Democratic hero. Harris effectively accused Kavanaugh of perjury, collaboration against special counsel Robert Mueller
, and other unsupported misdeeds. Not to be outdone, Booker jumped up to declare himself Spartacus.
The problem is that someone actually did kill Spartacus. In this case, Kavanaugh walked from the hearing on his own power with a presumed Senate majority of support. It is certainly true that Republicans prevented access to information that might have undermined him, but neither Booker nor Harris made a convincing claim as future consul of the Democratic Party. One moment, however, did leave Booker looking a bit like a consul wannabe. In an uncharacteristic move for the usually mild mannered senator, Booker had a confrontation with reporter Byron Tau, who asked if his Spartacus moment was a political stunt. Tau said Booker told him he was “violating the Constitution by being in his way.”
That comment was unlikely meant as a real threat, as it is neither within the character nor authority of the senator. Presumably, Booker was referring to the fact that he was on his way to a vote and the speech and debate clause under Article I states that members of both Houses of Congress “shall not be questioned in any other place” when going to and from Congress. However, this is meant to deter the government, not reporters, which is why there is an exception case of “treason, felony and breach of the peace.” Given the grilling over the uncertain constitutional interpretations of Kavanaugh and support of imperial presidential authority, it was a sharply discordant moment. If you are Spartacus, you should not be denouncing reporters like a Roman consul.
Booker later went on television, trying to reinforce his Spartacus bona fides. He struggled to establish that he was actually breaking Senate rules by releasing other documents. He has now released more than 20 documents uncleared by the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was like claiming to be a retroactive Spartacus after the battle. That could subject Booker to admonishment after a Senate Ethics Committee investigation, still far short of staging crucifixions between on the way to Rome.
Putting all of the theatrics aside, the Kavanaugh hearings left a troubling and damaging precedent for a process that already lacked substantive content. I have been a critic for years of the modern confirmation hearing, which is largely about senators rather than nominees. The hearings drained what little substance remained in the process. The unilateral denial of documents and theatrics of the opposition left the hearings as little more than a stunt by both parties. There was not a Spartacus to be found but, instead, an overabundance of would be Roman consuls.

0,09/07/18 10:15 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/405426-making-partisan-gerrymandering-fair,Making partisan gerrymandering fair,"Gerrymandering has a bad name because the party in control of a state typically divides the state into House districts that give it more than its fair share of seats in Congress. 
Surprisingly, there is a simple solution to this problem: Give the majority party the right to divide the state into two parts according to the proportion of votes it and the minority party received in the last congressional election. 
For example, if a state has 10 congressional districts and the majority party wins 60 percent of the statewide vote, the majority party would be able to divide the state 60-40 in population. Its part would be the larger part with six districts, and the minority’s part would have four districts.   
Each party would then be able to gerrymander its part.  This is “fair gerrymandering” because each party can gerrymander only the districts in its part.    
To compare this with how gerrymandering works today, consider the 2014 congressional elections in Pennsylvania in which Republicans won 55.5 percent of the statewide congressional vote.
Because they controlled the state legislature, they were able to gerrymander Pennsylvania’s 18 congressional districts so that they won 13 districts (72.2 percent) and the Democrats won only five in 2016.
With fair gerrymandering, the Republicans, as the majority party, would have been able to divide the state in two, with one part comprising 10 districts and the other 8, which approximates the 2014 vote split.  
The Republican gerrymander of its part probably would have garnered it about seven of its 10 districts, and the Democrats about six of its eight districts.  Overall, each party probably would have won about its proportion of the statewide vote — a very different result from the 13-5 split favoring Republicans in 2016.
Ideally, of course, it would be preferable to eliminate gerrymandering entirely by having an independent commission draw the district lines.
Laws have been enacted in six states to do this, but it is highly unlikely that the other 44 states will move quickly to reform the districting process. (In Pennsylvania, however, a court challenge by the Democrats led to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court apportioning the state into mostly competitive districts for the upcoming 2018 elections.)
This past June, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider partisan gerrymandering cases from two states, Maryland and Wisconsin. It may revisit these or other cases to try to settle the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering, but in the meantime, gerrymandering remains a fact of political life in most states.
If fair gerrymandering is not a perfect solution, it is a pragmatic one that puts a constraint on the degree to which gerrymandering can be exploited by one party. Details remain to be worked out, such as what flexibility should be given to the majority party in dividing a state in two.
It seems desirable that the majority party should be restricted to drawing a more-or-less straight line that cuts the state in two, proportional to the number of seats to which each party is entitled.
It should, however, be allowed to respect traditional boundaries that do not arbitrarily split jurisdictions or communities. What is arbitrary will need to be spelled out. 
Another question concerns the entitlements of minor parties that qualify for one of more congressional seats in larger states. I suggest that after the two major parties receive their parts of a state reflecting their vote shares, other parties would then be permitted to divide the remainder of the state according to their shares. 
This is not entirely fair because the Green Party, for example, is unlikely to win in any congressional districts. But “possessing” a district may better enable it to push the major parties toward its positions.
Fair gerrymandering will work better the larger a state is. If a state has only two or three districts, the majority party may be able to divide it so as to win them all. But with four or more districts, the minority party will have more and more ability to gerrymander its part so that it wins a proportional share of districts in the state. 
A more sophisticated version of fair gerrymandering, which would require two cuts, applies the principle of “I cut, you choose.” The larger party would make a cut that gives it the extra districts to which it is entitled (beyond 50 percent).
In Pennsylvania, this would be a part that contains two districts (10 – 8), which it would presumably be able to gerrymander so that it wins both. 
The smaller party would then be able to divide the remaining districts into two equal parts, which in Pennsylvania would each contain eight districts.  
The minority party (Democrats in Pennsylvania) would then choose the part it prefers, and the majority party (Republicans) would get the other part. This would give each party a good chance of winning most of the districts in its eight-district part.   
The fact that one party will predominate in its part of the state is not entirely fair to voters of the other party who live in that part. But their votes won’t be entirely wasted because they will count toward how the state is split into districts two years later.

0,09/07/18 09:15 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/405521-white-house-in-chaos-whats-new,White House in chaos — what's new?,"The president decided the entire White House staff was working against him, running their own agenda, not his or that of the nation. Poll ratings had plummeted, with job approval in the 30s. Leaks were a common occurrence as staffers hyped their own policy positions, even brazenly floating them in trial balloons. The president was on edge, feeling helpless amid the chaos. His reelection looked like a fantasy. There was an independent counsel investigation examining all his business dealings. The attorney general was cursed all day long inside the White House for a crazy investigation. Even the first lady faced a grand jury.
In response, the president convened covert meetings in the White House residence at night with outsiders during which the real policy and communications decisions were made, bypassing most of the official government operations. Big decisions like announcing a balanced budget and going after the tobacco industry were made in secret, with staff mystified where it was all coming from. Almost the entire White House staff would eventually be turned over. Bob Woodward would later write a book describing what the Washington Post reviewer called a “chaotic” decision making process by a volatile president with frequent “temper tantrums” who was an “indecisive” chief executive.
2018? No. This was 1995. On a good day, the White House is a totally crazy place with swirling intrigue, backstabbing, leaks, and books by departing staffers. The stakes are the highest in the world and so, typically, are the tensions. Many of the staff have ideological agendas and have been raised entirely in politics, often coming from Capitol Hill with little experience outside of government. George Stephanopoulos published a memoir on his political education with the Clintons, calling it “All Too Human,” that depicted his work as too many lies and too much chaos.
History has an uncanny way of repeating itself. Aides have felt they know better than their leaders since Joseph and the Pharaoh. “Anonymous” in the New York Times believes he knows better how to run the country than our elected leadership. New presidents, particularly outsiders, face a hostile and controlling group of Washington elites who believe they own the place over mere elected officials who come and go. Arriving from Arkansas, the Clintons were as alien to Washington as the Trumps. They faced many of the same problems of runaway staff, investigations, and chaos in the White House. Instead of CNN and MSNBC, they soon would battle a Fox News channel that aimed to set their hair on fire daily.
Clinton’s reaction, after disastrous midterms, was to take back his White House from his left-leaning staff, bringing on a new team to help move him back to the center. He made deals with the new Republican majority on welfare reform, a balanced budget and immigration reform. While triangulating in the Beltway, he reached out to the broad swath of America that wanted an end to partisan rancor and to get things done. He chose pragmatism over ideology, and so did the public. The result was the last sustained period of unity, peace, and prosperity in our nation.
Trump today finds himself in much the same place as Clinton in 1995. His poll numbers may be a bit higher, and prosperity came sooner in his term, but Trump is likely also facing a change of Congress and perhaps a repeat of the 1998 impeachment battle. He has a solid base with Republican and working class voters but has alienated a lot of Americans in the center, making it impossible in the current environment for him to put together a majority coalition. As problems have mounted, his instincts have led him to reinforce the 46 percent base that voted for him. Clinton, who was elected with 41 percent in 1992, reached higher to expand his base.
Today, the public has a 60 percent negative view of the Republican Party, a 58 percent negative view of the Democratic Party, and a 54 percent negative view of the president, according to the last Harvard Harris poll. Despite the vast 70 percent of Americans who believe the economy is growing stronger, no political figure in either party owns the vital and decisive center of the electorate the way Clinton did in the late 1990s.
Clinton made the right, if unorthodox, choices when confronted with a narrowing political funnel. Trump has retreated to familiar territory and rallies in safe states. Policies like infrastructure have languished while immigration and trade continue at the forefront. There is no evidence that he, nor top Democrats, realize that this remains a centrist country looking not just for economic success but for leadership that brings a majority of the country together for a higher common purpose.

0,09/07/18 09:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/405520-why-did-clinton-share-the-stage-with-farrakhan,Why did Clinton share the stage with Farrakhan?,"Imagine President Trump
being invited to speak at the funeral of a white singer who he admired (say, Ted Nugent, if he were to pass) and seeing that David Duke was on stage in a place of honor. Well, President Clinton gave a speech in the presence of Louis Farrakhan at the funeral for Aretha Franklin. Hillary Clinton
was sitting off to the side but did not speak.
Why would President Clinton, a good man and a friend of the Jewish people, do this? There are several possible answers. First, he was taken by surprise at Farrakhan’s presence and didn’t want to do anything to disrupt the service. But the “shoe on the other foot” question remains: Would he have acted similarly if it had been Duke rather than Farrakhan?
Second, Clinton doesn’t believe that refusing to sit alongside a bigot is the proper response to bigotry. Again the “shoe on the other foot” question remains: Would he sit alongside Duke? Third, Clinton doesn’t regard Farrakhan as comparable to Duke. But that is simply wrong. Farrakhan is a blatant anti-semite with an enormous following. Finally, Farrakhan’s anti-semitism is not considered as serious a problem as Duke’s white supremacy. But without getting into comparisons of bigotry, anti-semitism is a serious and growing problem.
Farrakhan is at least as bigoted as Duke. This is a man who only last year called Jews members of the “Synagogue of Satan” and claimed that Jesus called Jews the “children of the devil.” Farrakhan is also a homophobe claiming that Jews are “responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men.” In the past, Farrakhan delivered similar remarks claiming that “when you want something in this world, the Jew holds the door” and calling Adolf Hitler “a very great man.” He’s also a racist claiming a few years ago that “white people deserve to die.”
Many younger people on the left may not know the extent of Farrakhan’s bigotry, or they may condone it by claiming he did a service for African American communities. For example, Tamika Mallory, cofounder of the Women’s March, called Farrakhan a “GOAT,” or greatest of all time, and Congressman Keith Ellison
, deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, once called him a “role model for black youth.”
Earlier this year, a photo of Barack Obama
smiling with Farrakhan taken in 2005 emerged. (Although I supported President Obama, both in 2008 and 2012, I would not have campaigned as enthusiastically for him had I known then about this suppressed photograph.) Ellison, who may become Minnesota’s next attorney general, later distanced himself from Farrakhan but, like Mallory, claimed that Farrakhan’s contribution to African American empowerment is “complex.” Would we accept this kind of complexity and nuance if a white singer’s family had invited Duke?
Liberals need to make unequivocally clear that the Democratic Party tent will never be big enough for anti-semites and anti-Americans like Farrakhan, just as Republicans need to do the same with sympathizers of the alt-right. There are not “good people” on the side of anti-semitism, any more than there are “good people” on the side of white supremacy.
There is no place for a double standard when it comes to anti-semitism. Black anti-semitism should not get a pass on account of the oppression suffered by so many African Americans. Neither should “progressive” tolerance of anti-semitism of the kind shown by Bernie Sanders
backing Jeremy Corbyn, the anti-semite leader of the British Labour Party who may well become the next prime minister of America’s closest ally.
Just contrast the Aretha Franklin memorial service with the controversy surrounding the decision of the New Yorker to invite Steve Bannon
for what promised to be a critical conversation with the magazine’s editor, David Remnick. After many prominent liberals, such as Judd Apatow, Jim Carrey and Patton Oswalt, announced that they would not attend lest they “normalize hatred,” Bannon was disinvited. Chelsea Clinton tweeted, “For anyone who wonders what normalization of bigotry looks like, please look no further than Steve Bannon being invited by both @TheEconomist & @NewYorker to their respective events in #NYC a few weeks apart.”
To that I would add, look no further than the Clintons sharing the stage with Farrakhan. I hope they will take this occasion to distance themselves from, and strongly condemn, Farrakhan’s anti-semitism.

0,09/06/18 12:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/404900-impending-battle-of-the-bases-will-make-governing-afterward-difficult-no,Impending ‘Battle of the Bases’ will make governing afterward difficult — no matter who wins,"The 2018 campaign will be the Battle of the Bases – a showdown between President Donald Trump's Republican base and the Democrats' progressive base. Base elections are more about rallying your core supporters than about persuading uncommitted voters. Independents and moderates are treated like a ""third sex.""  Who needs 'em?
A Member of Congress once said, ""In politics, you have to have a base. Your base is the people who are with you when you're wrong."" Sooner or later, everyone in public life is bound to be wrong. Ronald Reagan’s base stayed with him during the Iran-contra scandal.  Bill Clinton
’s base remained strong during his impeachment ordeal. To the amazement of old political hands (like me), Donald Trump kept his base – even his evangelical base – during the controversy over the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in 2016. 
The base wants a fighter, and Trump is certainly that. ""Traditionally in the two-party system, politicians and their team try to make their base bigger,"" former Mississippi Governor and Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour told The New York Times. ""Trump keeps trying to make his base harder.""
Trump did not create the bitter division in American politics. It goes back to the 1960s. Bill Clinton once said, ""If you look back on the sixties and, on balance, you think there was more good than harm in it, you're probably a Democrat. And if you think there's more harm than good, you're probably a Republican.""
Trump succeeded four presidents in a row who tried to heal that division. They all failed. The first President Bush promised a ""kinder, gentler America."" He got fired after one term. Bill Clinton called himself a ""New Democrat"" and an apostle of the ""Third Way."" He got impeached. The second President Bush said he was ""a uniter, not a divider."" He left the country more divided than ever. Barack Obama
said, ""There is not a liberal America and a conservative America."" He was proved wrong.
Trump never pretended to be a healer. He ran as a divider. He got elected as a divider. And he governs as a divider. The president and vice president are the only officeholders in the U.S. elected by the whole country. But President Trump
doesn’t act as if he is president of the whole country. He acts as if he is president of his base.
The art of governing doesn’t interest this president too much. He comes into his own at campaign rallies, where his rhetoric is becoming increasingly unhinged. He has pledged to do six or seven rallies a week during the fall campaign.
Trump polarizes the electorate, deliberately intensifying divisions over issues like immigration, race and trade. He said he would have ""no problem"" forcing a shutdown of the federal government in October if he doesn’t get the immigration restrictions he wants, including funding for a border wall with Mexico. The prospect of a government shutdown horrifies congressional Republicans. To Trump’s base, however, it signals his willingness to fight. They see the president as a rule breaker who gets things done.
A strategy of mobilizing your base countermobilizes the opposition. That’s exactly what’s happening. Democratic congressional candidates are raising more money than Republicans, more even than Republican incumbents. Democratic primary turnout this year is setting records in state after state. Trump has brought the progressive movement back to life after the demoralizing losses of Bernie Sanders
and Hillary Clinton
in 2016. While Trump's candidate was winning the recent Republican primary for governor of Florida, Bernie Sanders' candidate defeated the establishment Democrat and won the Democratic primary.
A student once asked me, ""Is this the most divided we've ever been as a country?"" I responded, ""We did once have a Civil War. Three quarters of a million Americans died during the Civil War. But this is probably the most divided we've been since that terrible time.""
If Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, they will be under enormous pressure to impeach Trump. He's a rule breaker, and rule breakers often get into trouble. Impeachment will take over the political agenda, just as it did in 1998. Republicans will rally to support President Trump just as Democrats rallied to support President Clinton. 1998 was the first midterm election in 64 years in which the president's party gained seats in the House of Representatives.
Five primary races to watch on Tuesday

A base campaign is bound to be relentlessly negative. And divisive. It will make governing difficult because after the election, the parties won't be able to work together. It endangers democracy because each party treats its opponents as illegitimate. The winning party sees victory, however narrow, as a mandate to destroy everything the other party has done. For Trump, that means eradicating all traces of Barack Obama’s presidency including health care reform, environmental protection, trade agreements and treaties. If Trump ever succeeds in building his promised wall on the Mexican border, Democratic candidates will race to the wall to hold rallies and shout, ""Mr. President – tear down this wall!""
We will end up with cycles of lunging political revenge, first one party and then the other aiming to undo everything its opponents did in office. Hope and inspiration – the political style of both Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama – will no longer be in evidence.

0,09/06/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/405346-how-to-make-election-predictions-in-sea-of-american-political-discontent,How to make election predictions in sea of American political discontent,"Listen to the news these days and one will quickly realize the 2018 election is about many things. It is a referendum on the president, it is the year of the woman, it is Donald Trump
taking over the Republican establishment, it is the Supreme Court nomination, it is the resistance. In truth, 2018 is all these things and more. When close to 100 million people go out to vote, there is plenty of space for different storylines.
It is tempting to emphasize one single factor to predict an election, particularly if it is what someone happens to be an expert on. However, the best professional forecasters understand that no single approach leads to knowing the future. Good prediction uses independent indicators and looks for common conclusions or divergent directions.
Accurately being able to handicap elections calls for willingness to consider information that challenges preconceptions. A partnership we are forming between the deep knowledge of Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics and the opinion research of Ipsos Public Affairs is one such effort. Our new Political Atlas combines different indicators to look at all the races for the House, Senate and governors.
So what do the data tell us? First of all, a historical note. It is normal in American politics for the party outside the White House to pick up House seats in midterm elections, and this year looks to fit that broader pattern. The party of the president in office has lost ground in the House in 36 of 39 midterms since the Civil War, with a loss of 33 seats on average. Democrats need to net 23 seats to win the House this year, which is hardly guaranteed but also would not be an ahistorical outcome.
Public opinion research tells us that the 2018 election will be marked by the same discontent and desire for change that helped propel Trump to the White House. Despite a strong economy and no major foreign wars, which two factors that when present can hurt the incumbent party, the president is unpopular and, while his popularity is not really dropping, his approval rating is stuck roughly in the low to middle 40s.
A Democratic lead on House generic ballot polling suggests that many seats held by Republicans should be in play this fall, an assessment that is confirmed by a seat by seat analysis based on both polling models as well as other indicators, such as recent special election results, fundraising, district level polling, and a high number of open seats controlled by Republicans. Social media indicators also point to an enthusiasm advantage for the Democrats, as do surveys that ask members of each party about their level of excitement about the election.
Put it all together, and the Democrats appear to be favored in the race for the House. However, there is still enough uncertainty that Republicans could hold on to the majority, albeit with a reduced size. The Senate is a different story because the roster of seats in play is so unfavorable to Democrats, who are defending 26 of the 35 seats this year. Trump carried five of these states by 18 points or more. To put that in context, only two House Democrats represent districts that Trump won by such a margin. Democrats benefit from the usual midterm trend and the specifics of this election cycle in the Senate, too, but likely not in a way in which they could pick up the two seats they need to win the majority.
We would be remiss if we did not mention some contradicting indicators. Fundamentals models that rely more heavily on economic conditions and incumbency point to Republicans having stronger chances. These same models proved to be more accurate at predicting the ultimate success of Trump in 2016 and should be considered. However, given the pronounced level of public dissatisfaction, as the president is unpopular and fewer than one in three Americans believes the country is on the right track, these structural models should be somewhat discounted.
This multidisciplinary approach to election forecasting will be central to our efforts through the rest of midterms. However, it is important to remember that circumstances change and forecasts need to change along with it. The Political Atlas will give everyone the ability to triangulate different data sources and reach their own conclusions.

0,09/02/18 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/404733-mueller-probe-blows-election-headwinds-into-republicans,Mueller probe blows election headwinds into Republicans,"With a guilty plea on Friday to a federal lobbying charge by Republican political consultant Sam Patten, the inevitable question arises: What impact will the special counsel probe have on the midterm elections?
Patten pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent while lobbying on behalf of Ukrainian interests. He admitted steering $50,000 from a Ukrainian oligarch to the Trump presidential inauguration committee. His plea follows by one week the federal jury trial conviction of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort
and the guilty plea to other federal charges by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.
Despite all of this, and despite President Trump
falling to 36 percent approval in a recently released Washington Post/ABC News poll, the available evidence does not show that the generic vote for Congress, with Democrats leading by eight points in the most recent Real Clear Politics estimate, has been impacted by Robert Mueller
’s investigation. Indeed, over the past few months in most polls, Trump’s numbers have stabilized in the 40s and, if anything, the generic vote has tightened slightly. What, then, is the impact of the Mueller probe? It is likely to hurt the Republicans for two unrelated yet important reasons.
First, with the attention the mainstream media gives the probe daily, along with near continuous coverage on cable news, the ability of the president and the Republicans to put out a positive and consistent message about the economy has been limited. To be sure, polls show people are increasingly positive about the economy and the impact of the administration’s policies on their personal economic well being.
Yet, the Republicans have been unable to systematically articulate this message or to tie it to individual candidates for the House and Senate. Unless this is able to occur, Republican candidates across the board are likely to be adversely impacted. I think back to the 1982 election, following the 1980 “red wave” and the election of Ronald Reagan as president. In that campaign, the Republicans, facing 10.1 percent unemployment, ran on a message of “stay the course” to give Reagan’s economic policies and tax cuts a chance to work. In the wake of economic news that is far less good than we are seeing now, the Republicans minimized their losses, losing only 25 House seats and two Senate seats.
Given the 4.1 percent economic growth in this year’s second quarter and record low unemployment across the board, the Republicans need to demonstrate the same kind of focus that earlier Republicans demonstrated 36 years ago. Yet, the amount of attention given now to every aspect of the special counsel probe makes this much more difficult than it was back then to articulate a consistent message.
Second, in the absence of any showing (as of yet) of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, the Democratic leadership is wisely doing all it can to focus messaging more generally on corruption rather than impeachment or specific allegations against the president that have yet to be demonstrated conclusively.
To be sure, the Democrats must avoid playing into Republican hands by advocating the kind of extreme leftist policies that the socialist wing supports, and that the Republicans have said now represents the new mainstream of the Democratic Party. Most importantly, the Democrats should avoid making midterms a referendum on impeachment, an issue which, at best, is a 50/50 proposition with the electorate.
By avoiding advocacy of health care for all, a job for all, a $15 minimum wage, or redistribution of income, Democrats also can take advantage of the challenges that the Republicans currently face from the top down, and potentially win a clear majority in the House and potentially limit any substantial losses in the Senate. Time will tell.

0,09/01/18 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/404670-brett-kavanaugh-will-bring-middle-principles-to-our-polarized-nation,Brett Kavanaugh will bring middle principles to our polarized nation,"There is plenty of controversy over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, but almost none of it is about him. Even detractors appear to have abandoned any claim that he lacks the intellect, experience, or temperament to be an outstanding justice. Critics have combed through 12 years of his opinions on the District of Columbia Circuit, second only to the Supreme Court in the high profile cases it decides, without coming across a single opinion that is half baked or unreasonable. Not that there are no complaints about results, as no judge decides every case the way everyone wants. That would be impossible.
But the opinions provide little or no fodder for a serious attack on Kavanaugh’s professional performance. Nor has his personal life turned up any attackable nuggets. He appears to be happily married to a woman with a successful career as city manager of a liberal community. He is praised by his female law clerks for his support and mentorship. He does volunteer work for the poor. He likes baseball. There will be no repeat of the scurrilous Clarence Thomas hearings.
In ordinary times, Kavanaugh would be widely praised on all sides, and confirmed by the overwhelming supermajorities that Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer received as recently as the 1990s, or at least the comfortable margins of John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, or Elena Kagan. This is unlikely. Neil Gorsuch, with a similarly unblemished record of excellence, won with the support of only three Democrats. Kavanaugh will be lucky to do as well.
But this has absolutely nothing to do with Kavanaugh. He might as well stay home from the hearings, which are not about him. In nominating Kavanaugh, President Trump
did a distinctly un-Trumpian thing. Unlike the populist, anti-establishment, norm shattering, often extreme Trump, Kavanaugh is a mainstream, conventional, cautious, credentialed product of the center-right establishment. True blue Trump supporters were disappointed, much like true blue left progressives were disappointed when President Obama nominated Kagan and Merrick Garland
.
Temperamentally and philosophically, Kavanaugh more closely resembles the moderate John Roberts than the fire-breathing monster some of his detractors are attempting to portray. It would not surprise me, although I could be overly optimistic here, that with Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and Justices Breyer and Kagan showing signs of willingness to break with their more leftward brethren or sistren, the new Supreme Court could have a serious principled middle for the first time in decades. That would be therapeutic for our obsessively polarized country.
Why, then, will there be a polarized vote on Kavanaugh? There are three reasons: ideology, partisanship, and Trump. The usual left issue advocacy groups have predictably lined up against Kavanaugh, with all the predictable exaggerations about his record and the same tired chicken little prognostications that they have made about every Republican Supreme Court nominee since Robert Bork. They seem not to have noticed that conservative jurists tend to be, well, conservative. They do not like abrupt change, which means they tend to prop up decisions that they would not have voted for in the first instance.
A word of cynicism may be in order. Advocacy groups, both of the right and of the left, make their money by exciting (a polite word for scaring) their constituents. Neither side has a great track record for fairness or accuracy. A rule of thumb is never trust the judgment of a right-leaning advocacy group or pundit who has never supported a Democratic nominee, or of a left-leaning advocacy group or pundit who has never supported a Republican nominee. Unfortunately, the advocacy groups have gained in influence every cycle for the past 30 years. It almost makes me nostalgic for the innocent time of the Bork nomination, when his opponents at least professed to think it wrong to oppose a nominee on purely ideological grounds unless his views were “outside the mainstream.” On that standard, Kavanaugh would get 100 votes.
Partisanship among lawmakers also is increasingly blatant. Not long ago, judicial nominees were confirmed unless there were something specially objectionable about them. No more. The new normal is that the opposing party will line up, lock step, against any nominee of a president of the opposite party. The time is coming when no judge can be confirmed if the Senate is in opposite party hands than the presidency, which is itself an increasingly common occurrence. Senators today live in fear of the extreme wings of their party and cannot do the responsible thing even when they know it is for the good of the country.
Some of the hostility of Democrats to any nomination of a Republican president, no matter how qualified, is due to backlash against the Republican Senate’s refusal to consider the nomination of Judge Garland, an exemplary nominee, to the Supreme Court in 2016. Of course, Republicans thought their actions toward Garland were a justifiable backlash to Democratic refusals to consider Republican judicial nominees in election years in the past. Whatever the merits of those arguments, they should not be allowed to poison the well of Supreme Court nominations forever, or the nation will pay a stiff price.
Then there is Donald Trump. Many Democrats tell themselves that their disregard for old norms about judicial nominations is a reaction to his unique presidency. Some just cannot believe a man of his character was elected president and will do just about anything to deny him the prerogatives of the office and if possible to remove him. Some sincerely believe that impeachment or criminal prosecution is in the offing, and worry that Kavanaugh will protect Trump from the just arm of the law.
Senators cannot properly ask Kavanaugh how he would vote on hypothetical matters involving Trump, and if they do ask, he should follow precedent and refuse to answer. But they can ask him whether the White House team who selected him asked any questions regarding potential legal issues involving the president, and they can insist that he commit himself to judge any potential legal issues with an open and nonpartisan mind. My guess is that Kavanaugh will have no difficulty answering those questions and providing those assurances. Richard Nixon’s nominees to the Supreme Court did not support him in U.S. v. Nixon, and Bill Clinton
’s appointees did not support him in Clinton v. Jones. There is nothing in Kavanaugh’s record of public service that suggests in the least that he will carry water for Trump, should it come to that.
In the meantime, there is an issue of principle at stake. Whatever any of us might think of Trump, he was elected president by a vote of the people in accordance with constitutional processes. Unless and until actual charges are brought and proven against him, the people of the United States are entitled to the presidency they voted for. In my opinion, it would be highly improper for any senator to vote against an exemplary nominee to the Supreme Court in the anticipation that the president may at some time in the future be impeached, charged, or convicted of a crime. Unless and until that happens, Trump is entitled to nominate a new justice to the Supreme Court, and we should all be pleased and relieved that the nominee is a person of the character and ability of Brett Kavanaugh.

0,08/30/18 03:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/404418-will-stock-market-launch-republicans-to-victory,Will stock market launch Republicans to victory?,"In 1992, James Carville famously coined the phrase “it’s the economy, stupid” to focus attention on the prevailing recession at the time in order to help Bill Clinton
successfully unseat George H.W. Bush. If it really is all about the economy, the current environment of accelerating growth and unemployment at historically low rates should have the Republicans feeling pretty good about their chances in the midterm elections.
Fairly or unfairly, the party in power generally gets the lion’s share of the benefit when things are going well and the blame when things are going poorly. Supporters of Barack Obama
rightly contend that Donald Trump inherited an improving economy, and supporters of Trump point to positive economic trends since his election. The truth of who is actually responsible for economic performance likely lies somewhere in between.
The stock market is a reflection of the economy, albeit an imperfect one. Most importantly, it is most often a forward looking reflection of the economy, and it certainly appears as to be a tailwind for Trump and the Republicans.
As a value investor, I focus on earnings and the price to earnings ratio of both individual stocks in the market and the price to earnings ratio of the market as a whole. Many investors and pundits jump to the conclusion that by traditional measures, the stock market is wildly overvalued on a price to earnings basis and that a stock market correction or even a crash is imminent. They cite the fact that the S&P 500 index is selling at a price earnings ratio of 25 times, compared to an historical mean of 15 times, trailing over the past year.
I take issue with that simplistic assessment and believe that current valuation levels are still quite favorable to stocks, particularly over bonds. The 10-year Treasury bond is yielding less than 3 percent, which means that it is essentially selling at a price earnings ratio of nearly 35 times earnings. Moreover, those “earnings” that a purchaser of the 10-year bond is entitled to do not grow.
The stock market is forward looking, and the S&P 500 index sells at a price to earnings ratio of around 17 times on a forward looking basis over the next year. That ratio is actually slightly down from last quarter, and substantially down from around 19 times a year ago. In essence, on a forward price to earnings basis, the stock market has recently gotten less, not more, expensive. Many analysts focus too much on the “price” part of the equation and ignore that earnings growth has accelerated.
Now, the attractiveness of stocks overall, and stocks relative to bonds, declines as interest rates rise, and rapidly rising interest rates could derail stock market growth. This is why President Trump
has been publicly critical of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s policy of slowly raising interest rates. The overwhelming consensus of the market is that interest rates are going to continue to rise over the foreseeable future, but only at a very measured pace. It is likely that Fed will raise the target federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points at its meeting next month. There is also a good chance that the Fed will again raise the target fed funds rates by another 0.25 percentage points in December.
So with the economy humming along and, if it really is “the economy, stupid,” will Republicans prevail in the midterm elections? There may be an even stronger wind blowing than the economy. Parties in power most often lose ground in the midterms. A reflection perhaps of buyer’s remorse from the previous election, the deck is generally stacked against the incumbent party. Since 1934, in 21 midterm elections, the incumbent party has lost an average of 27 House seats and nearly four Senate seats.
Furthermore, incumbents have only gained House seats in three elections and Senate seats in five elections. This November, the underlying economy, as reflected by the stock market, will certainly be a tailwind. But for Republicans, the headwind of history may prove to be even stronger.

Kennedy once said, “at least we can make the world safe for diversity."" JFK already knew that a wholly liberal-democratic world would be unlikely, but he hoped to ensure that liberal democracies could live peacefully alongside other forms of government.
Today an expanding cohort of states are moving in an authoritarian direction and worrying the financial markets. After the Cold War, a kind of euphoria took hold: Capitalist democracy would be unstoppable. Now, China, Russia and others believe that conviction.
Earlier, it was often thought the populations of authoritarian countries would demand more freedom once a certain level of prosperity was reached. Mostly, this did not happen at all, or countries were caught by the middle-income trap before citizens started to worry about their liberties. Only 13 out of 101 middle-income countries in 1960 had become high-income economies by 2008. This phenomenon is increasingly important; five of the seven billion people on earth live in middle-income countries.
In many of these countries an implicit agreement between governments and people has applied (and often continues to apply) which dictates that the price for strong economic growth is political passivity, to put it mildly. Naturally, most regimes will not allow their citizens to abandon this “deal.”
There have been more and more signs in China recently that authorities are tightening the reins and restricting freedom (even further) for fear of the painful side effects — including sluggish growth — of stabilizing the credit system and transitioning from an export-oriented economy to a technologically advanced economy, powered by consumption.
Leaders in other countries are shifting toward “authoritarian regime” on the political spectrum. Leaders like Maduro in Venezuela and Erdogan in Turkey have put their countries in precarious positions with high foreign-exchange debts, sky-high inflation, very unusual monetary policies, irresponsible government spending on prestige projects, large twin deficits and the loss of international goodwill.
This takes us to the key trends around the world right now. Marian L. Tupy, connected with the libertarian think tank CATO, wrote the following while discussing a book by Jonah Goldberg:
“Our rule-based society … a staggeringly complex global economy that turns strangers from different continents into instant business partners, and a meritocratic system of social and economic advancement that ignores people’s innate features … is both very new and extremely fragile. … The forces of tribalism always linger just below the surface. … From Russia and China to Turkey and, to some extent, the U.S., the all-mighty chieftain is back in charge.”
It remains to be seen if the world that JFK envisioned — in which democratic and authoritarian countries coexist in relative peace — is viable. The Trumps and Erdogans of this world increasingly question the world order mainly devised by the West. Winner-takes-all capitalism, growing inequality, stagnating real wages and large cultural-social change play into their hands.
The period roughly until the 1970s is often referred to as “The Glorious Thirty,” an era characterized — especially in the West — by a bountiful combination of high economic growth, increasing productivity, rising real pay, robust technological progress and steady expansion of the welfare state. Clearly, this period is behind us, leading to public dissatisfaction, the emergence of populists and a more inward-looking mentality.
Various negative trends are coming to the fore: from democratisation to a focus on identity and culture; from a world of relative order to a world in chaos; from interdependence to decoupling.
From a political viewpoint, there is plenty of scope for bears. Already, financial and trade wars are damaging free trade and jeopardizing alliances. Growth, international production chains and other forms of globalization are under threat from identity politics, protectionism and the erosion of institutes that have underpinned safety and economic growth for seven decades.
Populists rule Italy, Austria, Hungary and Poland; right-wing populists lead the polls in Sweden and are runners-up in Germany. Intolerant nationalism, xenophobia and illiberalism are the hallmarks of most of these parties and politicians.
Let us not forget that Europe is more exposed than many realize. As an example, Hungary did well in the Freedom House index in 2005-2010 but went downhill from there; many Southern and Eastern European countries are fairly young democracies, still trying to navigate the liberal western world. Meanwhile, we see mounting tension between West and East Europe, in addition to previous North-South tension. Of course, Europe's borders are restive and there is huge pressure on the trans-Atlantic relationship.
We see upcoming nations taking a harder stance as they exploit any opportunity to play Western countries against each other. And the West should beware alliances between parties that were seen as incompatible before; significantly, China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin have met 26 times since 2013.
The biggest fears for further weakening economic growth have focused on the implications of a trade war but a combination of trade conflicts, geopolitical brinkmanship and the weaponizing of global finance is the larger threat.
President Trump
is not afraid to deploy trade and financial weapons, but his opponents are little inclined to bite the dust, either. Considering the size of the U.S. economy and bond market, as well as the power of the dollar, the most likely outcome is that America's adversaries eventually will throw in the towel. Yet, by then, a lot of damage may already have been inflicted.
The global bear market that economists fear has certainly come closer. Western countries increasingly will be hampered by aging populations and high debt; emerging economies also will find it increasingly hard to overcome high debts in foreign currency through greater economic growth while their populations become ever more demanding. On top of this is a growing chance of further political instability as more democracies move towards the twilight zone between democracy and autocracy.

First, the trade deal removes uncertainty for businesses with supply chains that are dependent upon laissez-faire trade in North America. 
Second, it incentivizes Canada to make trade concessions in future negotiations to avoid being omitted from their largest trade market segments. Third, the United States and Mexico reached the agreement before President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office.
Protectionist trade policies were abandoned decades ago in favor of laissez-faire trade because they often do not work and can leave a nation’s production base worse off.
Allowing trade tariffs to aggrandize would eventually cause global growth to decline, and the United States’ GDP would not be immune from being dragged down along with it.
The centerpiece of the deal revolves around the automobile industry encouraging vehicle production in the United States with added incentives to use domestically produced steel and aluminum in the production process. It's a sweetener that will produce a tailwind for both of those industries.
This deal gives businesses greater certainty regarding their supply chains and input costs. Most importantly, it allows them to plan for their immediate and long-term future. This should encourage long-term investment, which is the foundation for the equity market to go sustainably higher in the future.
Canada is now under pressure to reach a deal now that two-thirds of North America has a trade agreement in place. The administration is proving that it is serious about cooperating with, and not just fighting with trading partners.
Canada, of course, cannot afford to risk being shut out of the North American market. We can expect them to be more flexible in negotiations, such as regarding U.S. dairy products entering Canada. Hopefully this deal results in a domino effect, with subsequent trade agreements to follow.
Mexico, over time, has gradually accepted capitalism and globalization. President-Elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) communicated a very nationalist message during his campaign, including increased social spending and a delay of NAFTA renegotiations.
I believe that Mexico is witnessing the financial problems that a handful of emerging markets are experiencing and wanted to get a deal done. The trade agreement removes uncertainty from the marketplace.
With the Federal Reserve communicating to the market that it will continue to gradually raise interest rates and with the dollar remaining strong, emerging markets will be vulnerable to foreign investor capital flight and the possibility of a currency crisis, which Mexico experienced in 1995.
Getting a trade deal signed was in the interest of both nations and their economies. In Mexico’s case, it acted first in engaging with its largest trading partner, cementing its relationship.
The deal benefits the U.S. by increasing the competitiveness of U.S. labor and removes uncertainty for midwestern farmers, a key political base for the administration.

We can expect the market to move marginally higher as the market prices in each incremental trade deal. This is a nice first step in removing a tit-for-tat trade tariff overhang from the market outlook. That will allow investors and businesses to model and plan for the long term.
For the market to move meaningfully higher, hopefully the world can embrace truly free trade policies that are fair and equal for all participants. If we can ever get to that point, capital markets could certainly reach incredible heights.

How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards.”
Wow, America is in Wonderland. Half the country sees the other half as upside down. Heading into the midterms, there’s little middle ground, largely because of the polarizing President Trump
, with his legal drama adding fuel to the fire.
Take income inequality. The rich appear to be getting a lot richer. And so the new socialism of the Democrats says it’s “obvious” that we should tax the rich and companies more, and give the money to everyone else. Except that moderate Democrats going back to Jack Kennedy have pointed out that investment would dry up, capital would leave the country, companies would become less competitive, and everyone would be poorer. So, tax the rich and hurt the poor. The irony is that when you lower tax rates, especially on companies and the rich, tax revenues go up and that leaves much more “fairness” to spread around. Tax revenues are up nearly 10 percent this year. Trump an instrument of fairness? Down is up.
 Take the poor and disadvantaged minorities. Since the 1960s, America has spent literally trillions of dollars in welfare payments and special programs for housing, food and education for the poor. And, as Shelby Steele points out in his seminal book on modern American politics, “White Guilt,” the late Sen. Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) was right all along: the welfare programs have utterly failed. They have embedded a culture of dependency among the poor and created an industry of Democratic “leaders” calling for even more welfare funding.
And, as Steele points out, those advocating even more welfare spending are wrong, patronizing and somewhat racist. Again, that Trump guy is creating jobs and lowering African-American unemployment, reducing food stamp rolls, and that might create real hope and change in American cities. Huh? I thought they called him racist. Down is up!
How about global warming? The many disastrous predictions of global warming have not come true. Rising earth surface temperature, warmer Southeast and Midwest, Greenland icecap disappearance and sea water rise, more hurricanes; data suggest the forecasts were wrong. Forest fires? The experts tell us the principal causes are more homes closer to forests and less thinning of forests because of — wait for it — “wilderness preservation.” The inconvenient irony is that extreme global warming “solutions” may distract from the implementation of real policies that most voters want: clean air, clean water, less serious industrial poison.
By claiming extreme problems and demanding extreme changes that distort economics, raise the price of energy by five to 10 times, raise the price of transportation, and ultimately food, the net result of climate change-extremism may well be to make food sufficiently expensive to spur global starvation. So “deniers” may really be saving the Asian and Central African poor from starving. What? Down really is up!
Medicare for all, pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders
(I-Vt.). Why not? Health care is a “right,” right? Everyone should have free access to health care. Except, the National Health Insurance Experiment in the mid-1970s, examining the impact of the public single-payer model and cost-sharing across the country, correctly predicted that the lack of effective market mechanisms to control costs would bankrupt Medicare (we’re very close) by now, and that a full, national, single-payer system would bankrupt the country. Medicare already is rationed — many doctors won't accept Medicare patients — and it will get worse as the feds reduce payments to doctors to control costs and there are fewer doctors. In short, Medicare for all will mean Medicare for none. Up is down.
The journalist and satirist H.L. Mencken once said, “For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple  and wrong.” Most politicians, TV pundits and voters may never have heard of Shelby Steele or H.L. Mencken, and so, really believe that up is down. We get daily newspaper commentary, cable TV news, political debate and social media commentary that screams “up is up” ... when it actually may be down. We’re left with a world in which what is so obviously right — for example, new socialism and environmentalism — often is wrong. And what is so obviously wrong — such as Trump — often may be right.
In Lewis Carroll’s classic “Through the Looking-Glass,” Humpty Dumpty tells Alice: “When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.” Hmm, I think that I just saw that person on TV, or running for office, or across the dinner table.

0,08/28/18 07:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/404073-lanny-davis-is-more-proof-2018-is-year-of-lawyers-living-dangerously,Lanny Davis is more proof 2018 is year of lawyers living dangerously,"For lawyers, it has been a wild year of living dangerously. The scandals swirling around Washington have left a pile of attorneys accused of leaks, false statements, or other improper conduct. The latest casualty appears to be Lanny Davis, who admitted this week to not only spreading a false story but then lying about being its source of information.
Davis, a Democratic stalwart who has been a close adviser to the Clintons, only recently announced that he would represent former Donald Trump
lawyer, Michael Cohen
, free of charge. Davis has steered Cohen into a complete turn from Trump loyalist to chief accuser. He suggested that Cohen could implicate Trump in crimes tied to collusion, obstruction, and campaign finance violations. He caused a firestorm nationally when he suggested Trump knew in advance about Russian hacking of Clinton campaign and Democratic Party emails and also approved the infamous meeting with Russian representatives in Trump Tower.
At the same time, Davis attacked Trump and his counsel as liars, saying his defense of Cohen is powerfully simple. “It is about truth, and the power of the truth is what Michael Cohen now has no matter what,” Davis said, adding that Rudy Giuliani “invents for a president who has been known to lie.” Davis has now admitted that he lied, fueling allegedly false stories that have occupied national media coverage for several weeks.
In a CNN story last month, it was reported that Cohen would implicate Trump as having advance knowledge of the Trump Tower meeting and that multiple people witnessed his briefing on it. After weeks of such reporting, Davis belatedly came forward to say that, in fact, Cohen did not have such evidence. But when asked if he was the source of the false story, Davis expressly denied it, telling Anderson Cooper, “I think the reporting of the story got mixed up in the course of a criminal investigation. We were not the source of the story.”
The denial came as a surprise, since various reports pegged Davis as the source. Finally, last night, Davis admitted to being the source of the false story on the Trump Tower briefing and lying about it when subsequently challenged. He told BuzzFeed, “I made a mistake. I did not mean to be cute.” Well, it is a tad beyond cute. As counsel for Cohen, Davis could be accused of spreading not just a false story but a false account of the conduct of both him and his client, and that could put him and his law license in jeopardy. The District of Columbia and New York ethical rules state, “In the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a third person.” Rules in both jurisdictions state that a lawyer shall not “engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.”
Making things worse is that his claim about the Trump Tower meeting suggested possible criminal conduct by Trump, his son, and others. Worse yet, the story planted by Davis, if true, would have implicated his client in false statements made to Congress, since Cohen previously denied such knowledge. The story was not just false but potentially put his client in jeopardy. For GoFundMe donors to Cohen, the admissions constitute a bait and switch. After fueling excitement about the impact of Cohen as a witness against Trump and driving thousands of dollars in donations, Davis has destroyed the credibility of the man he claimed would “reset his life” and try to “tell the truth.” CNN is sticking to the story, suggesting it has other sources stating that “Cohen claims Trump knew in advance of 2016 Trump Tower meeting,” even though Cohen now states, as he did before Congress, that he has no such knowledge.
Davis is a cautionary tale for lawyers serving multiple roles in scandals. He is a long standing Democratic figure in Washington legal drama, advising a range of clients, including the Clintons, on how to navigate through controversy. He is smart, affable, and well connected. But he straddles the murky line between lawyer and media flak, a dual role that is highly valued but dangerously blurs what should be the bright line of representation. Indeed, the key to spinning stories is to not become the story.
Davis is not alone. The Trump team has shown just how difficult that role can be. Cohen was infamous for his disastrous statements. Then there are Marc Kasowitz, John Dowd, Jay Sekulow, and Rudy Giuliani, all accused of varying false or misleading statements in public defenses. It is not clear if Davis is saying he made up the story or whether Cohen gave him the allegedly false account of being in a room with others when Trump was briefed on the Trump Tower meeting. It was a potentially credible claim since it would be so easy to disprove if no one corroborated it. Either Cohen lied to Davis, or Davis again made Cohen into a liar. Either way, this could well end up as a rare case where both a client and his attorney are called before bar proceedings.
The District of Columbia and New York bars may want to know who came up with the allegedly false stories and why neither man came forward immediately to correct the record. If Cohen is responsible, his newly claimed moral clarity will be viewed as just another hustle. If Davis came up with these stories, he put his client in a worse position and the bar might want to know why and whose interests were being advanced by such accounts. Just as his client seeks a deal with the special counsel to limit his prison time after pleading guilty, these admissions destroyed any residue of the credibility of Cohen as a witness for the prosecution. He also created an ethical equivalency between Trump and his accusers.
Davis recently declared, “This is about truth versus lying and ultimately Donald Trump is going to be done in by the truth.” Of course, truth is rarely the undoing of Washington insiders, particularly those whose careers have been to transform or a least transcend truth.

Quite simply, he should go abroad.
Right about now, President Trump
should make foreign affairs his administration’s top priority, knowing that when it comes to domestic matters his agenda has stalled, at least for the moment. A foreign affairs win would change the narrative, likely with Trump’s supporters and detractors alike.
History reminds us that it’s what a few past presidents did, including at least one who launched a military strike in the midst of political turmoil.
 Trump’s latest headline-making tweet, announcing that he canceled a fourth visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
, might be evidence that the president intends to spice up things with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to make the news media and American public forget about his legal troubles.
As Gregory Korte of USA Today notes, President Nixon, with the Watergate scandal swirling around him, visited 10 nations before he quit the presidency in 1974. President Reagan held an important meeting with Pope John Paul II while the Iran-Contra affair dominated the news.
And think back nearly 20 years to President Clinton’s four-day bombing campaign against Afghanistan and Sudan — right in the thick of his impeachment proceedings. Then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott declared, “The timing and the policy are subject to question.”
Clinton was accused of “wagging the dog,” or emulating a popular movie at the time in which a U.S. president used a military conflict to distract the American people. Former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, a moderate Republican who served in the Clinton administration, in 2004 testimony defended the action, explaining that “under no circumstances did President Clinton ever call upon the military and use that military in order to serve a political purpose.”
Unfortunately for us today, North Korea might be a willing accomplice in such a scenario, if events continue trending in a negative direction.
In a recent piece in Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, the North accused the Trump administration of staging military drills in preparation for a possible invasion if talks between the two countries were to fail. The article — citing a South Korean radio report stating that American “special units” had been moved to the Philippines — claimed that this was some sort of training to simulate “infiltration into Pyongyang.” There is even an accusation that a U.S. Navy submarine moved special forces from Okinawa, Japan, to South Korea recently, supposedly more evidence of America’s hostile intent.
“We cannot but take a serious note of the double-dealing attitudes of the U.S. as it is busy staging secret drills involving man-killing special units while having a dialogue with a smile on its face,” North Korea’s state-controlled newspaper said after President Trump called off  Pompeo’s visit.
Such accusations, strange as they are, seem to be a backslide toward pre-summit North Korean propaganda of half-baked, slightly crazy accusations. In years past, Washington would provide little to no response to such statements. However, keeping in mind Trump’s 2017 responses to Kim’s threat to test-fire missiles near Guam — when Trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” and nicknamed the North Korean dictator “Little Rocket Man” — one could easily see the current situation escalate.
And considering how the media gobbled up every insult then, if Trump launched a verbal war of words against North Korea again, the calls for his impeachment would suddenly move to the B or C block of TV news shows. The possibility of nuclear war tends to push all else aside.
The danger, of course, is that a war of words, in the media and online, easily could spiral out of control. Imagine a scenario in which Kim makes a specific threat, perhaps to test missiles near Hawaii. Trump responds, threatening “a test of my own near your country — and SOON!” Then, America and South Korea restart their military exercises, to remind Kim of U.S. military might, especially its long-range bombers.
But if one of those bombers were to veer too close to the Korean border and be fired upon by a North Korean soldier protecting his anti-aircraft missile site, Trump would face the toughest decision of his presidency.
Sure, with such a scenario that begins innocently enough, President Trump might succeed in distracting the public — but the cost might be astronomical. And then, of course, impeachment would be the least of his worries.

0,08/28/18 01:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/403913-trumps-south-africa-tweet-is-false-counterproductive-and-dangerous,"Trump's South Africa tweet is false, counterproductive and dangerous","Last week, President Trump
elbowed his way into a contentious, divisive debate about land reform in South Africa.
Reacting to a spectacularly uninformed segment of Tucker Carlson Tonight, he tweeted that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
“to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. ‘South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.’”
Not only were the president’s comments riddled with falsehoods, they were counterproductive and dangerous. 
First, the president (and Carlson) got it wrong. The South African government currently is not expropriating land without compensation, and there have not been large-scale killing of farmers. Those are patently untrue statements. In fact, some studies indicate that the number of killings of farmers and farm workers is at a 20-year low.
What is happening is that the ruling African National Congress (ANC) is debating whether to pass an amendment that clarifies an existing constitutional clause that allows exportation without compensation for the public good. 
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said land distribution will be handled responsibly, stressing, “It will not be a smash and grab.” Expect a long, drawn-out bureaucratic process.
I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2018
The context here is important. Since the ANC came to power, it has struggled to address a legacy of racial discrimination and economic inequality. No issue is more potent than land ownership for black South Africans.
It is both symbolic and integral to economic uplift for South Africa’s historically disadvantaged black population, and it has been moving too slow for the ANC. While some 3 million hectares have been transferred into black hands since 1994, land ownership is still disproportionately white owned. 
Ramaphosa faces considerable pressure, especially from his left flank to make headway on this issue. His party is up for re-election next year, and one of the two opposition parties, the Economic Freedom Fighters, is touting more radical reforms, including state nationalization of land.
Ramaphosa does not want to cede this issue and risk his rural constituency. At the same time, Ramaphosa is sensitive to the business community’s reactions.
As a former corporate executive, he understands land expropriation without compensation is anathema to investors, and he wants to show that the process will follow the rule of law and respect property rights.
It is no surprise, therefore, that Ramaphosa has followed up every public statement on land reform by engaging directly with South Africa’s farmers and corporations.
Second, the president’s tweet and his directive to Secretary Pompeo is the absolute wrong way to shape a policy debate in South Africa. No country appreciates Washington wadding into its internal affairs, but South Africa is notoriously intolerant of finger-wagging.
Whatever U.S. leaders say publicly — under any administration — tends to be a lightning rod in South Africa. If President Trump wanted to spur a constructive debate on land reform, he failed miserably.
The South African government swiftly rejected Trump’s tweet, accusing him of seeking to “divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past.”
Indeed, the president’s tweet has overheated social media platforms in South Africa, increasing the volume of hateful, racially charged comments. Justice Malala, a columnist, on Monday wrote that “this sensitive, important, complex and divisive debate will now be drenched with Trump’s ignorant, bigoted, and shortsighted views. We do not need yet another populist hack on this — we have enough already.”
His tweet also gives further credence to a narrative that the United States does not care about South Africa. The president has still not appointed an ambassador to South Africa, and U.S. aluminum and steel tariffs have hurt the country’s economy, which exported $1.3 billion in aluminum and steel in 2017 to the United States.
South Africa — the continent’s second-largest economy and an incoming U.N. nonpermanent Security Council member — is now even less likely to countenance U.S. requests on national security issues. The president’s tweet has made bilateral relations more difficult with a country where diplomacy is never easy — even in the best of times.
There is still time to walk back this disaster. President Trump should clear the air and correct some of the factual inaccuracies in his tweet. Then, the United States should exit the public debate. U.S. interests would be better served by following the advice of Princeton Lyman, a former U.S. ambassador to South Africa, who passed away last week.
Lyman counseled that South Africa has to ""own"" its challenges, but the United States can fashion its assistance to “facilitate it, help it though several crises and encourage it in a multitude of ways.”
If South Africa fairly and justly resolves its land issue, it will do so because it brokered its own settlement, and not one imposed or devised by outsiders.

0,08/22/18 10:30 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/402891-former-cia-directors-just-politicized-the-intelligence-community,Former CIA directors just politicized the intelligence community,"As a twenty-seven year retired veteran of the Intelligence Community—FBI and CIA—it was with great disappointment that I read the recent letter signed by 12 former Directors and Deputy Directors of the CIA, admonishing President Trump
for removing former Director John Brennan
’s security clearance.
Their letter is tacit acquiescence to the politicization of the Intelligence Community - something former Directors going back to the beginning, in 1947, have taken great pains to protect against and something every American should fear.
I, and many other Intelligence Community veterans, hold in great contempt John Brennan’s actions. Calling a President of the United States a traitor, without impeccable proof, is far beyond the pale. It demonstrates a lack of judgment and self-control, and is far beneath the demeanor required of a former CIA Director.
While some of the former Directors reportedly think Mr. Brennan is acting inconsistent with the stature of his office, they offer him support. They state the President is not upholding the requirements of his office, but decline to criticize Mr. Brennan’s outrageous conduct or to hold him to any standard. The implication is the elected President has to meet a standard, but the unelected government official does not. Their silence encourages Mr. Brennan to continue his antics and bring further disrepute on the Intelligence Community. 
 Sadly, it’s not surprising. Several of these Directors previously have made negative statements about President Trump. Former Acting Director Mike Morell, who organized the letter, in the heat of the 2016 campaign declared his allegiance to Hillary Clinton and stated in a New York Times editorial that then-candidate Trump was an unwitting agent of Vladimir Putin, essentially forerunning Mr. Brennan’s accusation of treason. His impeccable proof: that the two exchanged niceties and therefore Mr. Putin was using his KGB training to ingratiate himself with Mr. Trump. Downright silly.
Did the former Directors come together to condemn Mr. Morrell’s statement? No. Then, as now, their silence was deafening.
For a former CIA employee, not to mention a former Director, to be leading the opposition to a democratically elected leader in this country is unprecedented and a game changer. This isn’t about free speech, it’s about keeping the Intelligence Community out of the political life of this nation. It’s difficult to understand the former Directors’ failure to comprehend this fact.
This isn’t partisan: It doesn’t matter whether you despise or love President Trump. If President Trump is followed by a Democrat, will it be ok for former Director Pompeo to hurl the most gross accusations? To call out the Democratic President as unfit for office and a traitor? Democrats would be outraged, and I would agree with them. Yet, these former Directors have now sanctioned and made inevitable such political tit for tat by future IC leaders.
Mr. Brennan and the former Directors are trying to play the free speech card. But they and every Intelligence Community veteran knows that active and former officials, by law, have limitations placed on their free speech rights to prohibit the disclosure of sensitive and classified information, and to prevent politicization.
Directors have an unwritten, but even higher standard. It’s ensconced in precedent, not law, that former Directors remain apolitical. That doesn’t mean they cannot support candidates, but it does mean they don’t become the face of the opposition. It does mean they maintain a certain decorum.
Remember the negative reaction Gen. Michael Flynn drew when, as the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he led a “Lock her up!” chant at Trump rallies? They said he had gone too far and had violated the decorum of his office. Yet they seem to have no issue with a former CIA Director showing an unprecedented level of vitriol, accusation, and nastiness towards an elected President.
A former CIA Director leading the opposition could not be more damaging for the Intelligence Community. Articles are already appearing anticipating the upheaval amongst the 50 million Trump supporters that removal of the President could bring. Do you think - were the President to be removed – those 50 million Americans would forget Mr. Brennan’s actions and that former CIA Directors rallied around him? Would they not suspect the Intelligence Community had a hand in negating their votes?
Removing Mr. Brennan’s clearance was warranted to ensure the government did not acquiesce to his politicization of the Agency and the Intelligence Community. As Mr. Brennan’s outrageous conduct is not restricted by law—he has and retains his free speech rights—the only thing the President could do to signal the government’s disapproval was remove his clearance. As every Intelligence professional knows, a security clearance is a privilege, not a right.
Regrettably, the former Directors have put their stamp of approval on the politicization of the CIA and the Intelligence Community. It will be very difficult to return the community to its apolitical past. Something they, and all of us, will live to regret.

’s Black Tuesday, a momentous event in American politics and law, a great inflection point that gravely endangers his presidency.
With Paul Manafort
convicted of eight felony counts and Michael Cohen pleading guilty to eight felony counts, the credibility and clout of special counsel Robert Mueller
and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have soared to great heights.
The issue of a potential presidential pardon of Manafort — or even of Cohen, although that seems highly unlikely, given his actions and remarks — has taken center stage in American politics and law. Some argue that pardons may be imminent. I respectfully disagree, and I warn that, if Trump issues pardons, he could destroy his party and would doom his presidency.
 Legally, the most under-discussed aspect of the case is the magnitude of legal danger that Trump faces. If Trump is not reelected in 2020, there is no question that he could be indicted, if evidence warrants, the day after he leaves the presidency. 
If Trump leaves office in January 2021, he could be indicted for a long list of potential crimes governed by statutes of limitations that are five years or longer. This could include conspiracy, obstruction of justice and other potential crimes that occurred after January 2016.
For this reason, Trump’s worst-case legal jeopardy is far more dangerous to him than much of the public discussion suggests. While pardons would dramatically increase the legal dangers to Trump and political dangers to his party, they would give him far less protection than is generally realized. 
Trump’s more competent lawyers are probably warning him that if he pardons Manafort or anyone else targeted in the Russia investigation, he saves the pardoned party from convictions of past crimes that occurred prior to the pardon but not future crimes committed after the pardon.
If Manafort or others receive a pardon, they would quickly be subpoenaed by Mueller to testify before a grand jury under oath and without counsel present about their knowledge of the conduct of Trump and other suspects under criminal investigation. 
After being pardoned, they would be precluded from taking the Fifth Amendment protecting them from self-incrimination.
Mueller and his team, questioning a pardoned party under oath before the grand jury, would have far more information about the questions they would ask the pardoned witness before the grand jury. If they perjure themselves, the odds would be high that they are caught, prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned.
Both Manafort and Cohen, for example, are represented by highly skilled criminal lawyers who would warn them before they enter the grand jury room that they must tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
If they lie to the grand jury to protect Trump, they would risk extreme legal liability and potentially long prison sentences by committing perjury that would not be covered by the previous pardon.
Trump therefore has less incentive to pardon Manafort and others than some commentators suggest. They would probably “spill the beans” to Mueller and the grand jury after the pardon.
In addition, while the president has wide pardon power, he cannot legally dangle pardons to influence witness testimony or use pardons to obstruct a prosecution that continues.
If I am wrong and Trump issues pardons to convicted felons facing long prison terms, there would be a firestorm of national outrage so powerful that it would doom him legally and politically and doom Republicans at the polls.
If Trump issues pardons before the midterm elections, he would create a nightmare scenario for himself and Republicans by guaranteeing a massive Democratic landslide, dramatically increasing public demand for impeachment and helping elect a Democratic Congress to consider it.
If Trump issues pardons before the 2020 elections, he would doom any chance of his being reelected, which would make likely his worst-case nightmare of facing major indictments and potentially severe prison time after he leaves office.
If Trump issues pardons at any time, he would incite virtually the entire Department of Justice so severely that Mueller might well request, and his superiors might well approve, that Trump be indicted under the extraordinary-circumstances exception to Justice Department guidelines that are not legally binding. 
In this event, Mueller would convey his full case to Congress to consider impeachment while simultaneously indicting Trump, which would be decided by the Supreme Court.
My guess is that Trump is being advised by his attorneys and Republican leaders in Congress to not issue pardons, for reasons stated above. If he does, it would be the most catastrophic and self-destructive mistake in presidential history.

0,08/22/18 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/402987-joe-biden-is-best-hope-for-democratic-party-in-2020,Joe Biden is best hope for Democratic Party in 2020,"Ten weeks away from a midterm election that will determine whether Donald Trump faces a Congress of sharp oversight or blind obedience, let’s leapfrog ahead to 2020. Because it’s never too early to contemplate the fate of the nation.
Should the Democratic Party nominate someone like Bernie Sanders
or Elizabeth Warren
? Or groom a younger candidate? Or a candidate reflecting a certain diversity, geography, ideology?
Here’s a novel concept: Stop ruminating over too old or too young, too left or too right, and focus on picking a nominee with the best chance of beating Trump. Helmuth von Moltke, the 19th-century head of the Prussian army, observed that “No battle plan ever survives first contact with the enemy.” The Prussian was prescient: 2015 and 2016 showed us how true that is of any political campaign that’s faced off against Trump.
Which is exactly why Joe Biden
may be the best of the bunch.
When I chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, I’d brief President Obama and Vice President Biden on House races. Obama would process the information in a studious manner, nodding as he leafed through my presentation deck. Biden would spread his knees and pitch forward, as if diving into the data.
Then we’d go into his office and delve even deeper. He wanted to travel to House districts where he’d have the greatest impact.
So we’d chart the path: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida, Wisconsin and others. Those states had pools of once-blue, middle-class districts. Now those pools were frothing and rust-colored, the tide having shifted towards the Republicans. Biden innately connected with these communities. He could stem that tide.
Their neighborhoods, factories, downtowns have been buffeted by automation, globalization and an increasingly marginalized middle class. In these places, Donald Trump tapped into voter anxieties destructively, summoning people to fear with a dog whistle. But Biden’s “genesis story” — that narrative explaining who he is, where he came from and what he’s about — is palpable in these places. Trump scares-out his vote by lying, conniving, mocking, blaming, dividing; Biden turns-out his vote with authenticity and dignity.
Here, Biden reverses the Trump tide. Consider Pennsylvania: Trump snatched its 20 electoral votes by a measly margin of 44,000. The day before the election, he held a rally in Scranton, proclaiming: “They say we’re tied in Pennsylvania. I don’t think so. I think we’re going to blow them out tomorrow.” It ended up being a virtual tie statewide, but a Trump blowout in northeast and central parts of the state. If Biden, who was born in Scranton, flips Luzerne County (which he and Obama won in 2008) and fortifies Lackawanna (which voted heavily for him and Obama in 2008 and 2012),  he conceivably wins Pennsylvania. Then he can continue his path through Michigan (which Trump won by 0.22 percent), Wisconsin (Trump by 0.76 percent), Florida (Trump by 1.2 percent) and keep Ohio competitive.
Even if Biden doesn’t beat Trump in these areas, he forces battle there, distracting the president from trying to reclaim now remorseful voters who gave him the benefit of the doubt in 2016. When I’m asked the inevitable question about who Democrats should nominate, I ask back, “What do you think about Joe Biden?” A surprising number of Republicans offer their support; young voters have an attachment to him. But there are skeptics.
Some say, “Isn’t age a factor?” What’s better in 2020 — 78-year-old Biden who just defeated Trump or a younger candidate who didn’t? Also, what’s better — a functioning adult of any age or 74-year-old President Trump
taking his second oath of office and completing his sweep of the Supreme Court?
Then there’s the concern that Biden “talks too long.” Have we not learned the danger of 280 characters in a tweet? Is a guy who occasionally grows verbose worse than a president who succinctly boasted that one of his assets is “being, like, really smart”?

Tensions flare as GOP's Biden probe ramps up 
Finally, there’s the understandable concern for a ticket reflecting the nation’s diversity. That is important. And I’m for a person of any color that beats orange. The Democratic Party has a vibrant youth and diversity movement. There’s a critical place for them, both now and in the future. But they must demonstrate a proven ability to blaze a path to an Electoral College majority.
The path is in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. It’s in Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Florida. It’s uphill, uneven — and well travelled by Joe Biden.

Most of these meetings remained private, but occasionally content would leak out, either by accident or design. On one of these occasions, Diaz Canel met with Cuban journalists and was recorded explaining to them that the leadership transition from the Castros would pose new challenges to the Communist Party.
“We will not have Fidel anymore to go out onto the Malecon and calm the mob,” Diaz Canel said. He was referring to a spontaneous protest that occurred during the “special period” after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of its economic assistance to Cuba. At one tense moment Fidel Castro walked into the crowd of protesters, who reacted to his presence with astonishment and fear. They peacefully dispersed.
The Cuban government has proposed a new constitution for public discussion. To leave no doubt about the authority behind this document, the commission charged with drafting it is presided over by none other than Communist Party First Secretary Raul Castro, Second Secretary Ramon Machado Ventura, and President Miguel Diaz Canel. It undoubtedly will be acclaimed and promulgated. Diaz Canel and his mentor Raul Castro are well aware that the next generation of Cuban leaders will not inspire the fear that the revolutionary generation holds over the Cuban population. The solution advanced to preserve the role of the Communist Party as the undisputed guide for the island nation is to separate the functions of the Communist Party and the government.
Government ministers and even a prime minister can be let go when policies fail or popular discontent rises, while senior members of the Communist Party politburo pull strings in the background. This strategy is reflected in the notably younger and more racially diverse members of the current Cuban National Assembly and Council of Ministers. The new constitution will put term limits and age limits on officials. It will give the aspiring Communist Party members the sense they can advance as the revolutionary generation dies off. It will also allow the Communist Party politburo to rotate positions creating upward mobility while assuring that new officials do not get too comfortable in their positions.
While the Communist Party has been highly successful in maintaining the political status quo in Cuba for nearly 60 years, it has failed to create economic opportunity. The economic reforms introduced by Raul Castro beginning in 2010 saw ordinary Cubans pushing the limits of what was permitted and in some cases achieving economic success that was previously unimaginable. But this also unnerved Communist Party loyalists who saw their power eroding as their relative standard of living declined. The response has been to issue new regulations to severely constrain private economic activity and to prevent the creation of wealth.
Despite all the constraints on their activity, Cuban entrepreneurs have been the most dynamic part of the economy and a source of new government revenue. The Cuban government should be facilitating their activity rather than restraining it. Economic stagnation combined with the United States decision to end its policy of giving all Cuban entrants legal immigration status will increase pressure for change on the island. As the economic pressure increases, the Communist Party is in a better position to rearrange the players, but it also raises the odds that Cuba winds up facing a crisis rather than transitioning to a more modern country.

The answer is in their name,"Democrats are liking their chances going into this November’s congressional elections. History is behind them, including a strong precedent of opposition midterm gains and recent special elections revealing unusual GOP weakness. And so are most polls. Taking back the House looks likely, while a Democratic Senate is in play as well.
Nonetheless, internal debates and divisions continue to undermine Democrats’ confidence in — and arguably their chances of — a “blue wave” election in November. Denizens of democratic socialism and social justice urge greater radicalism to rally the Democrats’ multi-cultural base and boost turnout.
Abolish ICE, student debt, institutional racism and the patriarchy, pushing full-steam for impeachment are all rallying cries of the left. Pragmatists warn of the dangers of identity politics and emphasize a more traditional mix of working- and middle-class appeals, hoping to avoid scaring off older, white Americans, who tend to vote at a more steady clip.  
 As such, the party’s core message remains muddled. What does the Democratic Party stand for? Ironically, a simple and effective answer to this question is right in front of the Democrats’ face, quite literally embedded in their party’s very name. As this author humbly suggested in the dark days of December 2016:  
""To bounce back from Trump’s election, the Democrats must simply de-capitalize. Embrace the lower case. Turn the (D)emocrats into the (d)emocrats, focused on and united by the defense and promotion of political rights, civil liberties and rule of law that made and will continue to make America great. Both at home and abroad, make democracy the Democrat’s primary cause, core principle, and most visible brand.""
As argued then, the opportunity for the Democrats to become the party of democrats is a big one: After all, Republicans, who under Reagan, and to a lesser extent Bush 41 and 43, captured much of the rhetorical small ""d"" democrat terrain, appear to have traded their praise of democracy’s virtues for the siren songs of populism and nationalism.
Under Donald Trump, the GOP will be led by the most anti-democratic presidential candidate in contemporary American history, whose cabinet is staffed by a frightening number of plutocrats and generals and whose chief strategist’s political philosophy is frighteningly similar to national socialism.
With some notable exceptions, Republican leaders (not to mention the president-elect himself) have been remarkably sanguine about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and, just as alarmingly, their supporters’ growing tolerance for authoritarianism and rejection of democratic norms.
Meanwhile, the Tea Party’s pseudo-libertarian claim to grassroots democratic purity has gone up in the smoke of Trump’s economic populism and ethnic chauvinism.  
As such — and amazingly, in the world’s oldest democracy — there is now both ideological and strategic space for the Democrats to embrace basic democratic principles as the foundation of a popular campaign, which could help propel them back to power.
Needless to say, after the last 18 months of forced family separations, Helsinki, Charlottesville, travel bans, ""Enemy of the People,"" myriad lies about voter fraud and incessant attacks on judicial authorities, this analysis is even more pertinent today.
Some Democratic partisans may (still) dismiss this appeal with “been there, done that,” citing the party’s platform defending minority voting rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights, union rights and the like.
Some may also respond with post-Bush, Obama-era cynicism about the perils of promoting democracy abroad and declining support for democracy among Western millennials. 
Yet, these positions will not unite the party around a common — and critically important — message and set of values. By contrast, the chance for Democrats to claim (and proclaim) the defense of democratic rights as core principle may well provide the center pole for the Democratic Party’s big tent of social, economic and cultural identities.
It will also help Democrats court independents and even conservatives who cherish individual freedom and democratic institutions and who view the party’s previous emphasis on identity politics as inherently divisive. Indeed, the likes of George Will and Charles Koch are already there.
Indeed, effectively every American has been inculcated with at least a superficial admiration for and loyalty to democracy and democratic values, helping a Democratic campaign that puts defending democracy front and center to resonate deeply and widely.
While democracy can be a broad, malleable concept that Republicans could still try claim as their own and cloud the Democrats’ message, the GOP’s (d)evolution into the ""Party of Trump"" should put this worry to rest.
Indeed, Trump’s now clear disdain for political rights, civil liberties and the rule of law will give Democrats ample opportunity for political and moral clarity on these fronts.
Likewise, promoting and defending democracy at home will now more easily unite Democrats on what American should do (and represent) abroad. Opposing Trump’s efforts at disrupting U.S. alliances with democracies abroad while cozying up with dictators is a no-brainer for both liberal internationalists and their more left-wing compatriots.
While the former will welcome the opportunity to once again project the liberal ideal of American freedom overseas by loudly fighting for it within their own borders, the latter can more credibly fly the party’s flag while pushing for global citizenship and open borders, fostered by an outward-looking America.

made about former White House assistant Omarosa Manigault Newman
, is simple. What do we do?
It is my argument that if this battle turns into a reality television sideshow with the president and Omarosa going back and forth in the news, and Democrats merely attack Trump on this scandal in the same way they have for the past two years, the party will have wasted an enormous opportunity. Make no mistake, it is unacceptable for anyone, especially the president of the United States, to refer to someone as a “dog.”

In terms of political campaigning, however, the fundamental key is how do we influence voters, not how do we express moral outrage. To me, there is a very clear answer, which I discussed on a panel this month at Martha’s Vineyard, hosted by Henry Louis Gates and the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research of Harvard University. My argument is that Democrats need a moderate agenda that focuses on the needs of working people generally and African Americans specifically.
To be sure, Democrats need an answer to the issue of the job growth that has occurred in the African American and Hispanic communities, as well as in all the lower segments of society, during the Trump administration. The president, despite the abhorrent language he has used recently about CNN broadcaster Don Lemon, NBA basketball star LeBron James and his former aide Omarosa, has a point here. Since Trump became president, the economic position of communities of color has improved.
That being said, there remain clear gaps. While job creation may well have increased, the quality of opportunities that are available lag considerably. We do not have adequate programs to train and retrain workers for the jobs that exist in the technology or modern manufacturing sectors. We simply do not have a series of targeted initiatives to help increase wages for working people who are most vulnerable to another recession.
Put simply, Democrats need to focus on issues that will demonstrably improve the quality of life of people of color and all working class Americans, which means we need to encourage experimentation, whether it be in public schools, charter schools or parochial schools, in vocational training so that those not on a college track have opportunities to create a middle class lifestyle in our society today and in the future.
As the Democratic Party continues to play identity politics against a Republican Party which, despite the economic good news, is clearly out of touch, it is important to refocus on another huge opportunity that has come up. I realize it is no longer just enough to say that I do not want Nancy Pelosi
to be the Speaker of the House again. I believe it would be logical, appropriate, and well deserved to advance the candidacy for party leadership of Democratic Congressman James Clyburn. He has been a voice for both progress and consensus within the party.
Regardless of whether or not the next Speaker is Clyburn, we need new leadership. Moreover, African Americans need to play a significant, if not the most significant, role in framing the Democratic agenda and offering leadership to a party that desperately needs a new direction.

0,08/19/18 10:30 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/402458-election-officials-have-plenty-to-learn-from-hackers,Election officials have plenty to learn from hackers," Every year, DEFCON convenes thousands of hackers who attempt to breach the security of important technologies in an effort to expose vulnerabilities. For the past two years, this has included voting machines in a room dubbed the “Voting Village.” 
Rather than watch from the sidelines, or read about the findings in the news, I wanted to see for myself. So, I went to DEFCON. I listened, I observed and I had the opportunity to address attendees. 
While it’s important to constantly search for and understand the vulnerabilities of any voting system, a unifying message at the conference — from hackers to elections officials alike — is that we must be on alert and Congress must invest more to better secure our elections.
 Threats to the integrity of our elections are constantly evolving. Not too long ago, a primary focus for election officials was securing voting machines. Today, cyberattack vectors have expanded — and so must our defenses. 
This includes protecting our state voter registration databases, county election management systems, election night reporting websites, state and local government social media accounts and ensuring the information voters consume is accurate. 
Intelligence officials tell us that the “warning lights are blinking red” — and our adversaries are getting more sophisticated. It’s clear to me, as California’s chief elections official, that we cannot become complacent.
That’s why attending DEFCON was important. Though, as my secretary of State colleagues are right to point out, the environment under which voting machines were “hacked” at DEFCON do not precisely reflect real-world conditions.
On Election Day, voting machines aren’t left on tables to be opened or exposed for hours on end, and there isn’t unlimited public access to equipment at polling places or county offices.
Still, we could learn a lot from friendly hackers. Their insight can help us stay one step ahead of those who seek to undermine our democracy. It forces us to take second, third and fourth looks at systems. Elections officials must constantly scrutinize, test, adapt and upgrade security measures.
But no matter how much we learn or how much we innovate, we cannot succeed without adequate resources. Election administrations in America has been historically underfunded and understaffed. The burden of funding for election administration typically falls on the limited budgets of local governments.
States have a responsibility when it comes to properly funding election administration, including security. I’m proud that in California we secured $134 million in this year’s budget to upgrade or replace voting systems plus additional funding for the creation of the offices of Election Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management.
We’re also updating hardware and software, monitoring our networks around the clock, and we’ve strengthened communications and information-sharing channels with federal authorities.
Still, we can and must do better.
You may have heard that Congress recently appropriated $380 million for election security nationwide. Not quite. Remember butterfly ballots and hanging chads? The recent federal appropriation was simply the final disbursement of money originally approved in 2003 to address the debacle of the 2000 presidential election in Florida. 
There has been no new additional funding authorized to address our modern security challenges. To make matters worse, this month, the Republican majorities in both the House and the Senate defeated measures that would have appropriated $250 million for election security grants to states.
Meanwhile, they approved a $700-plus billion national defense appropriation — with not one cent for shoring up our nation’s election systems.
Protecting our elections from foreign interference is a matter of national security. That’s why our election infrastructure has been designated as critical infrastructure by the Department of Homeland Security.
For elections officials to implement needed election security measures, state and local governments need ongoing funding from federal and state budgets. We can’t let up, and we can’t rely on dated equipment. The stakes for our democracy are too high.
Until Congress takes our requests seriously and makes the necessary investments to further fortify our voting equipment and systems, election officials must think and act outside the box.
While I’m told I was the first secretary of State to attend DEFCON, I’m confident I won’t be the last. We have a responsibility to learn from hackers, particularly those wanting to help. We owe it to the nation to do all we can to protect our elections.   
Nothing short of our democracy is at stake.

0,08/17/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/402323-why-do-democrats-love-socialism,Why do Democrats love socialism?,"“Democrats more positive about socialism than capitalism,” blares the headline on a new poll by Gallup this week. According to the survey, 57 percent of Democrats and left leaners surveyed have a positive view of socialism, compared to just 47 percent of Democrats and left leaners who have a positive view of capitalism.
What the heck? There is only one way to read this: Way too many Democrats are simply uninformed. I am not saying they are stupid. I am not saying they are ignorant. I am saying they are uninformed. Sadly, that is not surprising, given the tripe that passes for “education” in our public schools. And it is even worse for those who go on to college. Most four-year universities and colleges in this country are populated by left-wing professors whose hatred for America is only surpassed by their sense of entitlement to the fruits of other people’s labor.
The typical graduate of the typical four-year college in this country thinks better of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and Ho Chi Minh than he or she does of Ronald Reagan. They simply do not know, or understand, that socialism is but one step removed from communism, and communism kills. Ask the survivors of Pol Pot’s Cambodian killing fields (where upwards of two million out of a population of just eight million were killed), or the survivors of Stalin’s purges (where upwards of 20 million were killed) what they think of communism and its “softer” cousin, socialism.
The Democrats (and Democrat leaners) who said they have a positive view of socialism clearly do not understand the link between economic freedom and political freedom. History shows you simply cannot have one without the other. That’s why the United States was able to leapfrog over the older, more established, more socialistic nations of Europe to become the world’s dominant power in the middle of the last century. Risk-taking, entrepreneurship, and property rights are the very heart of capitalist societies. They are the engines that drive economic growth and innovation, the “sine qua non” of economic dynamism.
Economic growth and dynamism lead to a higher standard of living. More money in your pocket means more control over the decisions that affect one’s own life. And that leads to more political power. Individualism is the heart of the American experiment. Risk-taking is what allows the son of a Syrian immigrant to build the world’s most valuable company. Entrepreneurialism is what allows a college kid building a software solution for rating girls to turn his idea into a multibillion-dollar company in less than a dozen years. Capitalism is what allows an entrepreneur to build an online bookseller into a company whose sales will surpass $200 billion this year.
Do any of the Democrats and left leaners polled in the Gallup survey think Apple, or Facebook, or Amazon — or any of literally thousands of other companies that provide value to their customers and employees — could have been birthed in Sweden? Capitalism is, at its core, inextricably linked to the American experiment. Ours is a nation of risk-takers, not risk-avoiders. For those who insist that capitalism is inherently selfish, and ignorant of the challenges faced by poor people around the world, keep this in mind – our capitalist system has done more to pull people out of poverty both here and abroad than any other economic system in the history of the planet.
But Democrats — at least an awful lot of them, according to Gallup — seem not to understand this link between economic freedom and political freedom, without which they cannot enjoy personal freedom. They don’t understand that if we yield our economic freedom to government, to let government take more of our resources and make spending decisions for more of our money, we will also be yielding our political freedom, and, in doing so, reducing our personal freedom.
It is not surprising to learn that so many Democrats don’t get the connection. This is a political party, after all, with a major leader — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who just said “We’re not going to make America great again. It was never that great.” Surprising? No. Disappointing? Yes. Fighting words? Most definitely.

A recent report from the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization casts  doubt on Pyongyang’s denuclearization steps.  
On June 12, Donald Trump
and Kim Jong Un met to hash out an agreement to treat North Korea as a normal nation in return for that state’s abandoning of its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland.
Hopes were nearly stratospheric after the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders. In return for denuclearization, Kim wanted:
an end to the United Nations sanctions;
a genuine peace treaty instead of an armistice stopping the Korean War;
formal diplomatic recognition of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK); and
the removal of 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea since the intra-peninsula war.
The test-ban commission’s report seeks independent verification of the DPRK’s proclaimed demolition of its underground nuclear test site at Punggye-ri. It wants international inspectors to access the site and verify the claims. North Korea feels it has done enough and demands sanction relief before doing anything else.
 Since Kim briefly stepped out of the cold at the historic meeting seemingly to embrace nuclear disarmament and reconciliation with the U.S. and South Korea, the world has looked for evidence of Pyongyang’s sincerity and American reciprocity for Kim’s apparent conciliation.
Perhaps we have been looking too much at the DPRK and not enough at its two key enablers of its nuclear-threatening behavior. The impoverished communist dictatorship could not have endangered the peace and security of East Asia during and after the Cold War without the diplomatic and material support from its two major patrons — China and the Russia.
It is significant that the Kim regime did halt tests of its nuclear weapons since the September 2017 nuclear detonation. The world is safer without these tests.
The early accomplishments now are being overshadowed by a recent U.S. report to the United Nations regarding North Korea’s breaching of the U.N. Security Council’s cap of 500,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per year.
Being diplomatically circumspect, the United States did not identify nations implicated in transferring oil from their ships to North Korean vessels at sea. In the past, both China and Russian ships made illegal transshipments.
In Addition, South Korean companies have transferred North Korean coal to their ships and then deposited the cargo in its own ports. Moreover, China has allowed some of its corporate entities to resume production in the North.  
The once-tight sanction regime that pressured Chairman Kim into bouts of reasonableness no longer hold his feet to the fire. The whole embargo regime, in fact, looks as porous as Swiss cheese. Little wonder, the DPRK can afford to drag its feet in fulfilling Kim’s denuclearization assurances.
Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury targeted three companies in China, Russia and Singapore for breaching trade restrictions on the rogue state. On its own, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
’s sanction statement is a step in the right direction.
But realistically, it is unlikely to change minds in Moscow or China about violating the UN embargo. They can play the North Korean card whenever they wish to even the score with their American nemesis. 
Pyongyang could not survive without its Russian and Chinese enablers. Washington relations with its two main adversaries have worsened since the Singapore agreement. The escalating trade war with China has intensified and bilateral relations with Russia have deteriorated even with the Helsinki sitdown with Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.
Beijing has stepped up assertiveness in the South China Sea. Days ago, it warned off U.S. reconnaissance planes with notices to “leave immediately and keep out to avoid misunderstandings.”
To punish Putin, the Trump administration just imposed new sanctions on Russia for poisoning a former Russian spy and his daughter earlier in the year. Washington’s relations with its two rivals are on a downward spiral.
Neither adversarial power, therefore, is inclined to pull American chestnuts out of the North Korean fire. Both nations have facilitated illicit trade with their militant dependency. During 2018, the United States reported that the DPRK significantly increased ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products that wound up in its harbors.
The upshot of the patron-client phenomenon is that the economic and diplomatic pressure needed to bring Pyongyang around to verifiable denuclearization is evaporating. The North Koreans understand this emerging reality and the freedom of action it lends them.
The United States is left with bad options. It can attempt to keep a semblance of the sanctions on the North, despite the violations by Beijing and Moscow.
The South Korean government of Moon Jae-in is also a weak link in the sanction chain, preferring a peace treaty with its northern adversary followed by trade and bilateral cooperation.
Washington can accelerate regional deterrence by building up missile defenses on U.S. warships and on land within Japan and South Korea. But it can’t count on Russia or China to push the DPRK on America’s behalf.

0,08/15/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/401945-will-white-house-press-briefings-return-to-what-they-used-to-be,Will White House press briefings return to what they used to be?,"According to legend, modern relations between the press and the presidency took shape one day in the early 1900s when Theodore Roosevelt looked out his window and saw a group of newspapermen (and, yes, they were all men back then) huddled in the rain. He invited their “dean” William Price, a correspondent for the Washington Evening Star, to come inside and have a place to work in the executive mansion.
As White House historian Martha Joynt Kumar notes, that account is largely apocryphal, and daily “briefings” for the press probably began when War Secretary Daniel Lamont shared observations with reporters when Grover Cleveland was president before the turn of the century.
So the daily press briefing is at least 120 years old. Let us celebrate! Or should we? Every president back to George Washington has considered the press annoying and has grumbled about coverage of the White House. Why do they ignore the good things we are working on? Why do they focus on the negative speck and miss the log of great news we are harvesting? Who are the anonymous aides who provide juicy tidbits at the expense of “on the record” statements from spokespersons?
The White House press secretary usually bears the brunt of this presidential unhappiness, as did I when I worked for Bill Clinton
. Yet, President Clinton would stop meetings on occasion and ask for me to “get to the Oval” so that I could hear an important discussion within the administration. He would not call me to his office because he wanted me to opine, but rather because he knew, as he once put it, that “the press will be all over you on this and I want you to know what we are thinking.”
President Clinton understood, as every president until now understood, that the media, the free press, and the Fourth Estate are surrogates for the American people. Journalists are present at the White House every day to hold accountable those who are in power. They keep a watchful eye on the awesome strength of the executive branch in our system, adding to the checks and balances codified in the Constitution.
They are not, to put it directly, “the enemy of the people.” They are “the people,” with all the faults, diversity, contradictions, and disagreement that “we, the people” represent. A daily encounter between those who cover the White House and those who work in it is, to me, then, an indispensable ritual of our democracy. If the president is not available to answer questions, someone should be there to be accountable, to offer the White House perspective on news of the day, and to pass along information about what the president will be up to on his schedule.
I would wake up early every morning, scour the four newspapers left on my driveway, and rehearse the questions and answers I knew I would face later in the day as I walked the dogs, took a shower and hustled to the White House for the daily senior staff meeting at 7:30 a.m. By then, 90 percent of the briefing was in my head, and my colleagues and the president would work in the morning to refine and perfect the answers. I would devour every memo, briefing paper, classified information, and input from Cabinet secretaries and administration officials I could find.
The 1 p.m. briefing (and, yes, I usually was late) would run 30 minutes to 45 minutes and would be over when the senior correspondent, then Helen Thomas of UPI, looked around the room to see if anyone had additional questions. She would then give me a curt “thank you.” And we were done. Then I would go take a nap. Early in my tenure, I decided to give radio and television correspondents access to the briefing for their broadcasts. Until then, broadcasting the daily briefing was heavily restricted.
In retrospect, this was a mistake because the daily briefing was not supposed to be an alternative to daytime soap operas. It was merely an exchange, and reporters were supposed to use the information provided, test it against other sources, and then produce their reports. My briefings, especially when a young White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, came into the news, wound up on live television. To this day, I wish we could return some understanding that the daily briefing is not a “news event” put on by the White House. It is simply a raw ingredient for further reporting.
These observations are obviously intended to make the point that something is seriously out of whack now. A press secretary does not show up at the podium with obvious disdain for the reporters she confronts. The presidency is not imperial, and some measure of humility is required of the person at the podium. “The humble shall be exalted,” as scripture puts it, knowing that Sarah Sanders knows the Bible well.
In some ways, her position as White House press secretary is impossible. She has an audience of one that she needs to please, but she cannot serve him well without serving the interests of those in the press who protect our collective right to know. I am not sure this White House will ever understand that very fundamental truth, so the question will be whether we can return to a more amicable relationship between the press and the presidency when the next chief executive takes office.
However, we should understand that we pay some price for the current acrimony which poisons civil discourse in our country. Maybe it was a stretch for Jim Acosta of CNN to demand that Sanders disavow “the enemy of the people” label. But she can show that she understands how noxious that statement is by showing up each day at her briefing, willing to take the tough questions asked, giving the best answers she can, and staying there until the press dismisses her with a genuine “thank you.”

0,08/13/18 07:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/401659-why-political-scientists-arent-writing-about-russian-hackers,Why political scientists aren’t writing about Russian hackers,"Like many academics who study American elections, I found 2016 to be a humbling experience.  There are many things that those of us who study election mechanics — campaign finance, what polling data have to do with voting, how different population groups vote, how effective political advertisements are — got wrong.
Any conscientious political science professor will be able to tell you how the election results have affected our teaching and our dealings with the public. We’ve become a bit hesitant about making bold predictions. We’ve rewritten our syllabi so that we can help students think about the political and economic circumstances of the Middle American states that provided Donald Trump
with his margin of victory.
One striking thing about the state of research on American politics over the past two years, however, has been the uncertainty among political scientists about how to deal with the biggest question mark that hangs over the 2016 election — the role that agents of the Russian government may have played in the campaign.
 The American media has provided nonstop coverage of the unfolding Mueller investigation, of the congressional hearings on Russian interference, and of revelations from Facebook and other platforms about data breaches, fake news stories and the like. Yet what I’ve found most striking about the academic meetings I have attended in 2018 has been the inability of political scientists to find a way to talk about such things.
Let me give you a couple of examples. This year’s annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, the largest national association of political scientists, will take place over Labor Day weekend in Boston. Over 6,500 people will be participating in some way or another. However, only four presentations address the involvement of Russia in the 2016 election — and not a single one of these four is by a tenured American academic.
There will be many papers on the quality of election polling in 2016, on the activities of Super PACs and other financiers of the election, and of the television and social media strategies of the candidates. If the conferences I’ve attended so far this year are any indication, efforts will be made to figure out exactly what was different in 2016 from past elections. More than one presenter will make an offhand joke at the end about Russian interference, but that’s all it will be — a joke — lest the presentation sound a little bit too conspiratorial.
Second, there have been at least five national or international conferences on populism so far this year — and I’m sure there have been many others that I haven’t noticed. These conferences have drawn a large number of less quantitatively inclined academics from all sorts of disciplines, eager to try to apply what over the past decade has been a largely European literature on populist demagoguery to the Trump campaign — to explore ways in which Trump does, or does not, fit the same model as populist leaders in Hungary, Poland, or Italy. This has proven (at least from what I’ve seen) to be a largely speculative endeavor, one that frequently devolves into haggling over what the precise definition of populism is.
There are flaws, I think, in both of these approaches. There’s a lot about 2016 that didn’t quite make sense. A lot of campaign spending has not been documented — in part because, as Bob Bauer suggests, it has become easy for foreign governments or organizations to spend money to influence American elections.
We don’t have the ability to track exactly what went on over Twitter or Facebook in the election, which accounts were real and which were fake. And, as Bauer goes on to argue, we may not regain the sort of transparency that enabled us to study elections with the precision we once did.
We don’t really have any precedent for studying what a foreign government might do to influence an American campaign in this way because it hasn’t been done before in the United States. Maybe we’ll get there in a few years, but for now, all we know is that our research is more likely than usual to be incomplete.
At the same time, giving in to the temptation to wax poetic about the state of the world post-Trump too easily descends into political ranting, or to speculation about what might happen.  There certainly is a market right now for dire prognostications about the future of democracy. The problem, however, is that this has probably always been the case — there was a glut of books on this topic in the 1990s, for instance, and it’s hard to prove that we’ve really learned anything since then, or that books from that era have been proven to be true or false. In other words, all of this speculation winds up not being particularly scientific, and it’s not going to age well.
I don’t mean to suggest here that there should be a lot of research papers on Russian interference in the campaign — we don’t know enough, yet, about what actually happened, and perhaps we never will. However, it does seem that taking elements of these two approaches might provide a way forward.
Our inability to measure much of what went on in 2016 may provide cause for more theorizing. What really counts as a campaign contribution? What is the difference between trying to influence a campaign and trying to influence the broader political environment? How should we change our understanding of what foreign interference is, given changes in technology and the market?
These are questions that sometimes have narrow legal definitions, but, whatever the result of the Russia investigation is, what we have learned so far suggests that we need to take a step back from measurement and ask some theoretical questions — not necessarily the big theoretical questions we have been asking so far, but questions about what, exactly, we try to define and measure in political campaigns.

0,08/13/18 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/401521-dangers-to-the-first-amendment-if-foreign-campaign-dirt-is-criminal,Dangers to the First Amendment if foreign campaign dirt is criminal,"The “get Trump at any cost” legal posse has come up with a theory that puts not only the First Amendment at risk, but also the rights of voters to receive information about presidential and other political candidates. According to this theory, the federal election campaign statutes would make it a crime for any candidate to receive information from a foreign source about his or her opponent. The principle statute at issue reads as follows: “It shall be unlawful for (1) a foreign national, directly or indirectly, to make: (A) a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value, or to make an express or implied promise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a federal, state, or local election.”
The language and legislative history of the statute suggest that it was intended to prohibit the solicitation and receipt of cash or other material items of value. Although its words are open to a broad interpretation that would include information of value, to interpret the statute in that way would put it in direct conflict with the First Amendment, which at its core, protects information that political candidates can use to inform the American public about their opponents. If the statute were interpreted to apply to obtaining negative information about an opponent, the following hypotheticals would become reality. Remember these are purely hypotheticals, not based on any facts, intended to make an argument.
A Canadian reporter based in Washington provides information to the Hillary Clinton
campaign proving that Donald Trump
bribed Canadian officials to secure permits to build a hotel in Montreal. An Israeli green card holder attending an American university discovers that Clinton, while a student at Wellesley College, had joined the Communist Party. Bernie Sanders
is given information by a French socialist proving that Clinton and Trump colluded to defeat his primary bid. A Russian lawyer gives evidence that Clinton deliberately destroyed her emails to cover up crimes. A British spy provides information that Trump engaged in improper sexual behavior while in Moscow. An Australian journalist provides a recording of James Comey
telling a friend that he purposely reopened the Clinton email probe to defeat her bid for president.
All of these hypotheticals, most of which bear no reality but some of which may come close, would be covered by an interpretation of the statute that brought information within the words “a contribution of money or other thing of value.” In each of these hypotheticals, the information is provided by a foreign national. In each of these hypotheticals, the information is at the core of the First Amendment.
Yet, serious academics and other commentators who have joined the “get Trump at any cost” legal posse have argued on national television that the statute prohibits the kind of information that Russians may have wanted to offer the Trump campaign at the Trump Tower meeting. They argue that even if the information was obtained by the Russians lawfully and was not part of a larger “collusion” scheme, the mere gathering of any information from a foreigner, friend or foe, is a criminal violation of campaign laws.
Defenders of the unconstitutionally broad interpretation of this statute might argue that all of the information contained in the above hypotheticals could be given directly to the media, which would then publish it. That may well be true, but if the information was first given to a political candidate or campaign, it could not be transmitted by that candidate or campaign to the media. To do so would be to circumvent the statute by laundering the information through the media. Moreover, under the First Amendment, a candidate would have the right to use or withhold all or part of this information as it best served his or her campaign, rather than giving it to the media. Even if the media published the information, the First Amendment rights of candidates would be violated.
If the shoe were on the other foot, if President Hillary Clinton were being investigated for violation of campaign finance laws for seeking to obtain negative information about Donald Trump, the American Civil Liberties Union would be up in arms about this obvious violation of the most fundamental principles protecting the freedom of expression of candidates. But since the election of Trump, the ACLU and many other lifelong civil libertarians have failed the “shoe on the other foot” test. They have applied one standard to Clinton and a quite different one to Trump.
This double standard hypocrisy reflects a broader problem. Throughout the world, civil liberties have been weaponized by both the right and the left in support of their ideological agendas. The standard is “free speech for me but not for thee” instead of free speech and civil liberties for all including opponents. Under any neutral approach to constitutional principles, our campaign laws must not be broadened to deny candidates the right to receive negative information about their opponents.

While laws are officially passed and recorded, our democratic norms are more impalpable and harder to codify. However, they are just as crucial to our democracy and to public discourse. Yet, in often unconventional ways, we see administrations strive to shift America’s norms, testing the boundaries of what the public will accept under the guise of achieving progress. Our current president has provided quite appropriate examples, recently threatening to shut down the government due to lack of a border security package and proposing the retaliatory action of revoking the security clearances of select high ranking intelligence officials.
The precedent these actions would set, should they be carried out, have many repercussions; over past decades, the American presidency has become ever more emboldened to publicly foster a culture expectant of unquestioned loyalty. Yet, in the long line of other divisive actions by this administration — i.e. the Mueller investigation, trade war, unexpected foreign affair developments, to name a few — how much attention do these threats of action deserve? With the old adage of ""there being bigger fish to fry,"" should we consider shifting these proposed actions to the back burner?
Let us hope we are not at that point. The proposed retaliatory actions and threats of denying funding for the government are only the latest test of a president playing the line of what is legal versus what is right — a difference that is fundamental to the character of American politics. Legally, the president is within his rights to revoke security clearances, as this article aptly describes. Additionally, the Office of the President houses the pen for the final signature on a budget package, should it be deemed appropriate to use. But legality is not the final test of cultural acceptance. For that distinction it is not solely to the law that we must look for justification of a president’s actions, but also to our nation’s norms.
 When considered in concert with other actions of this administration and the many prior, a theme arises: the non-codified norms or standards of conduct upon which America’s democracy has relied are being stretched, torn, and depressed.
Our nation’s press, cloaked daily with the untrusting aftertaste of the fake news phenomenon and working to combat the fact-less based options spread on social media, has been in the throes of fighting for its dignity as one of our nation’s greatest tools of government oversight. America has relied on the press as a viable, institutional check on political power, not simply a propaganda tool or an echo chamber of opinions. The norm of a free press must be re-established.
Our nation’s judicial system — now much more commonly discussed than in previous years — has become a nest of controversy, doubt, and polarization. The Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and additional parties that participate in federal investigations must remain independent. The process must be apolitical and must reject outcome-based views of justice. This norm, which is under threat, must be retained.
Congress, America’s first branch of government, has traded in its legislative productivity for irrational levels of partisanship, election focused party-politics, and inappropriate deference to the executive branch. The House and Senate’s powers of oversight, legislative capacity, and resources need to be revived. A strong executive is not the sign of a weak legislature. However, a weak legislative cannot ensure that a powerful executive operates within its legal, ethical and statutory bounds. Today the checks on power are not properly functioning and there is not a proper balance. Congress, as an institution, must be revived.
As similar discussion points multiply over the coming days, months, and election cycles, the long-term consequences of these actions must not be overlooked. Nor should they be taken out of the context of past administrations. These proposed administrative actions, and others that have provoked questions of legality, cronyism, controversy, and constitutionality, should be considered with strict scrutiny to identify the precedents set for presidents to come. America’s next chapter will be defined by which norms are established, which are remade, and which are retained. Like its code of law, America’s political cannon of these standards is ever evolving and upon considering the government we have, it is important to remember Benjamin Franklin’s answer, given 231 years ago, upon the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention: “A Republic, if you can keep it.”

0,08/11/18 03:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/401370-the-key-for-exims-future-lies-in-accountability,The key for EXIM's future lies in accountability,"In recent years, a political debate has continued on whether the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), the U.S. export credit agency, should exist.
Opponents hold that EXIM favors large corporations and fails to drive sufficient job creation to justify its operations, while proponents argue that EXIM supports U.S. exports and jobs and matches mounting competition from overseas counterparts.
While the debate has continued in Congress and among pundits, the agency has not had quorum on its board since 2015, preventing it from approving deals worth over $10 million.
Discussions of reviving EXIM have resurfaced with the nomination of Kimberly Reed as president and chair of the board, who was met with sweeping support at her recent Senate Banking Committee hearing. Committee members were encouraged by Reed’s testimony, in which she committed to increasing transparency at the agency. 
 Reed’s nomination may soon be in the hands of the full Senate with the nominations of board nominees Spencer Bachus
, Judith Pryor and Claudia Slacik.
With these nominations, proponents hope that EXIM will soon have authority to approve larger transactions. However, any conversation on EXIM’s future, particularly with a potential expansion of its portfolio, must include strengthening its accountability framework to effectively address complaints from communities affected by EXIM’s activities.
Independent accountability offices, found across international financial institutions, serve a crucial role in this framework by addressing harm caused by the institution’s activities, such as labor violations and lack of proper consultation with communities. 
A robust accountability office would be a value-add to EXIM, proactively mitigating risk, resolving problems as they arise and feeding useful lessons back into the agency to improve its practices and the sustainability of its investments.
Furthermore, it would provide communities with a constructive forum to raise concerns. At her hearing, Reed testified that she is committed to protecting U.S. taxpayers, workers and businesses.
This office would ultimately benefit the American people, ensuring that investments made in the taxpayer’s name are not only avoiding harm and preventing costly reputational, legal and financial consequences, but that they also support sustainable jobs for American workers.
And this office couldn’t come at a better time. Globally, there is growing recognition of the importance of accountability offices for export credit agencies. The U.N. Human Rights Council recently called on agencies to develop effective and accessible offices as part of a government’s duty to prevent and address human rights abuses.
EXIM’s Dutch counterpart, Atradius, recently established a complaint mechanism to address grievances, including from communities affected by its activities.   
EXIM has the opportunity to be a leader in this regard. Although it has taken steps toward providing communities and workers with an avenue to raise concerns, it still has farther to go.
In its September 2015 report on the EXIM-financed Sasan coal project in India, which led to at least 19 worker deaths, EXIM’s Office of the Inspector General recommended that the agency establish a separate, formal process for complaints.
The following year, EXIM created an Environmental and Social Project Information and Concerns online form to receive feedback on these issues. While this was a positive start, EXIM must move beyond the form so that the experience in Sasan is never repeated.
Like other accountability offices, such as the Office of Accountability at the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, EXIM’s office should be independent, transparent and accessible.
Furthermore, it should have tools found at other offices, namely, compliance review and dispute resolution to convene EXIM clients and local people affected by their operations and find mutually acceptable solutions to harmful impacts.
A recent case that Accountability Counsel supported in Mongolia involving the International Finance Corporation’s accountability office demonstrates the benefits to all parties of a neutral dispute resolution process.
The case allowed nomadic herders to negotiate directly with the local government and a major mining company about impacts the Oyu Tolgoi mine, which EXIM supported, has had on local pastureland, water resources and herding livelihoods.
As a result, the parties reached two sweeping agreements that provide commitments addressing many of the herders’ concerns. If EXIM had been supporting the mine alone, the herders would have been left with little recourse.
While the nominee confirmations are not guaranteed, they set the stage to contemplate improvements to EXIM’s accountability framework. At a critical time in the agency’s existence, accountability must be at the center of its reform. The creation of an accountability office will only make the agency stronger, smarter and more effective.

0,08/11/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/401389-how-do-presidents-impact-party-success-during-primary-season,How do presidents impact party success during primary season?,"On Thursday evening, President Trump
touted the success of his endorsements of candidates in primary and special elections, tweeting that he was “5 for 5!” in recent contests. Flexing his social media muscles and using his support from the grassroots conservative base, Trump has weighed in on the elections to shape the political orientation of the Republican Party and build what he describes as a “red wave.”
His success in backing candidates, particularly in primary elections, demonstrates one of the most important elements of the “bully pulpit” role of the president, even as Republicans face the headwinds of midterm elections, both the historical challenges that come with every cycle and the current White House controversies. Trump has been advocating for candidates who support his policies on trade, immigration, and other hot issues, rather than traditional conservative stances. Across the country, this has reshaped some districts in favor of Trump aligned candidates, but underscores questions about Republican prospects in 2018 and beyond.
Past presidents have waded into primary elections to change the makeup of their parties with mixed results. In 1938, Franklin Roosevelt faced opposition to his New Deal policies and to expansion of executive powers from conservative Democrats. Confident that he could use his political capital and the appeal of his fireside chats, which were essentially the tweet storms of that era, President Roosevelt sought to reshape the Democratic caucus in Congress into a more progressive body that would support his efforts to relieve the Great Depression.
His efforts ultimately backfired, as national political trends favored Republicans after almost six years of the New Deal agenda and southern conservative Democrats resentment of his intrusion into local politics. Chastened, Roosevelt reshaped his policies, although a focus on the growing threat of fascism would bridge these differences between conservative and liberal Democrats. This divide resurfaced after the war and drove the realignment of parties in the 1960s and 1970s, when many conservative Democrats, particularly in the south, became Republicans.
Ronald Reagan weighed in on primary elections in a different way, offering the famous “Eleventh Commandment” that “thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.” Following the tumult of the party realignments and the emergence of conservative movement politics, this was put forth to foster a truce between conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party after years of bruising intraparty strife. As in 1938, these differences were papered over, but they have returned to the forefront as the Tea Party, conservative media, and a rebellion against establishment politics are threatening to fold the “big tent” of the Republican Party.
Trump and his efforts to translate his leadership of 30 percent to 40 percent of the electorate into a base that reshapes the Republican Party more closely follows the Roosevelt model rather than the Reagan model. Combined with an election strategy focused on highlighting conservative anxieties ahead of economic successes, the administration hopes that its base can translate the excitement from primary victories into midterm success and beyond as the party looks ahead to 2020.
The primaries have shown that a Trump endorsement does matter, especially when magnified by his allies in conservative media echo chambers. In highly gerrymandered districts where only the Republican primary matters and the opinion of the president carries great weight, both incumbents and challengers will feel strong incentives to reflect the Trump agenda for the party. However, special elections have shown that once safely Republican districts might now be competitive.
This could be more than the normal effect of the presidential party losing seats in Congress during a midterm election. In suburban districts, once the bastions of swing voting soccer moms, support for Republicans has sharply fallen. Younger and left of center Americans who have not turned out at the ballot box in the past appear to be mobilizing to demonstrate their displeasure with Trump and his allies in Congress. In some of those districts, moderate incumbent Republicans have already seen the writing on the wall and chose resignation over fighting for reelection.
In the long run, and especially if large numbers of moderate Republicans are swept away in November, Trump will likely change the party and create an opening that centrist Democrats can exploit. While it was a powerful force in the electoral college battleground states of 2016, demographic trends do not favor his politics. Trump is reshaping the Republican Party, but he is not setting it up for enduring success.

0,08/10/18 02:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/401278-when-will-congress-put-politics-aside-and-secure-our-elections,When will Congress put politics aside and secure our elections?,"All everyone seems to be talking about is the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russia meddling. Yet, one aspect of this story that seems to have profound implications has gotten relatively little attention. This is the interference with the actual administration of U.S. elections.
It is now well established that the Russian government targeted state election systems in 2016. Even the White House has, albeit begrudgingly, acknowledged this fact. Recent reports have revealed that Russian interference operations are ongoing, including new attempts to hack the 2018 election. Yet, election security issues have received relatively little public attention. Indeed, Senate Republicans just shot down additional funding for election security in advance of midterms.
Complicating this problem is the fact that election administration in America is primarily a matter of state control. As a result, the vast burden of protecting U.S. elections has mostly fallen to the states. Following the revelations of the 2016 election hacking, some state leaders have called for more investment to defend their elections, and a few state legislatures have taken proactive steps to secure their elections.
So everything is under control right? Not so fast. I gathered data on state election budgets from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2019 with the goal of determining whether states have invested in election defense based on the 2016 experience. In short, states varied widely. Some states increased spending on elections, often explicitly referring to concerns about election hacking. Other states seemed to just keep up with inflation. Distressingly, more than a third of states for which I had data decreased spending after the revelations of 2016 election hacking.
I also looked at budget requests made by state governors to their legislatures. Again, states varied widely, with requests ranging from large increases to meaningful decreases. Notably, among the requests for the largest increases in spending were Ohio, California and New York, which are home to Republican and Democratic governors who have been strong critics of the Trump administration and who are potential candidates for their respective party nominations for president in 2020.
The data show that state election defense has not boomed as some of us might have hoped. The data also showed that the political importance of the state or the closeness of its elections did not predict which states spent more. This means the next election may be in jeopardy. The results support two bigger picture ideas that should be obvious.
First, by relying on states to handle elections, the United States is practically guaranteeing that there will be wide variation in the strength of election defenses. But unlike for some purely local issues, the vulnerability of any state can have consequences for all of us. The choice of butterfly ballots in Florida in 2000, for example, may have determined who was elected president of the United States. State underinvestment in election security for 2018 or 2020 might turn those elections too.
Second, the state by state variation in election spending may not be random. Devolving election security to the states during a time of polarization is practically guaranteeing that election defense will become a partisan issue. This is especially true during a time when the claim of foreign interference itself has been polarized by lawmakers today.
This politicization is worrisome because, again, vulnerabilities in any state can have consequences for the entire nation. While election interference might benefit one party or the other in the short term, in the long term it will harm all of us by degrading our democratic institutions and our confidence in them. We have a shared national interest in defending all of our elections, not just those in blue or red states.
After months of unheeded calls for support, Congress has appropriated more federal funding for state election security grants. Even if these resources are made available in time for midterms, states have wide discretion on how to use these funds or whether to use them at all. This does not inspire confidence that U.S. elections will be secure soon.
Election security demands federal leadership. When the Senate Select Intelligence Committee issued its list of recommendations to respond to Russian election meddling, it began with reinforcing the primacy of states in running elections. I disagree. The first priority should be securing elections so that everyone has the opportunity to vote.
If that entails the federal government taking a larger role in election administration, so be it. Even the most ardent federalist acknowledges that Washington has an important role in national defense. It turns out that national defense today includes defending our ballot boxes.

The future felon who destroyed the landmark last week shone a bright light on Hollywood hypocrisy and double standards. The West Hollywood City Council wants the star gone. It sounds ominous until you realize the star is not even in the city’s jurisdiction. Last summer, West Hollywood also called for the impeachment of President Trump
. It is virtue signaling writ large, and further moves the needle in middle America the other way.
Trump’s biggest supposed crime is unlike any of the litany of charges against Hollywood executives and prominent figures. It is being a successful Republican. When Trump hosted fundraisers for Democrats, and the public was already aware of his behavior, he was deserving of a Hollywood star. Now, he is persona non grata. If the argument is that Trump is not a nice person, how much has changed since 2007 that made him acceptable then but unacceptable now? Has any revelation about Trump emerged since then, except for his political affiliation?
Who is not on the chopping block of stars? Bill Cosby, who was found guilty of sexual assault and accused of harassment by dozens of other women. Kevin Spacey, who faces allegations by 15 accusers, five of whom were teens at the time. Harvey Weinstein, a Democratic fundraiser extraordinaire, who was arrested on charges of rape and more. Oliver Stone, who defended Adolf Hitler in an interview. These are just a handful of the accused people who still have their stars on the Walk of Fame.
Perhaps the glitterati is just upset that he said that only frumpy celebrities backed Hillary Clinton
. Perhaps he is just a target that they are not able to demolish no matter how hard they push. Hollywood at large has been silent about its cavalcade of abusers and unpatriotic figures with their names on the famous way. In fact, only Jimmy Kimmel (yes, that Jimmy Kimmel) has pointed out that Trump’s star sits next to Spacey’s star.
Hollywood is infamous for its involvement in politics. Films that no one cares to see, but carry the correct “narrative” of the day, cycle through select theaters. The extremism of Michael Moore, who has praised Karl Marx, is no problem. Hollywood celebrates blacklisted communist writer Dalton Trumbo while taking a few notes from the other side of that part of history. Take your pick of lame Green Day songs, Bruce Springsteen screeds, and anti-war films that peppered the 2000s. Radicalism in support of the cause is no radicalism, to paraphrase Barry Goldwater.
Do not think for a second that Trump is the only conservative public figure who is being gagged for his beliefs. Tim Allen may have lost “Last Man Standing” due to his political views before it was revived by Fox. Roseanne Barr made egregious comments but lost her shield of invulnerability because of her outspoken support of Trump. Curt Schilling may be missing out on the Hall of Fame due to his conservative politics.
Trump is not the first in this wave of creed cleansing, and he will certainly not be the last. Celebrity sycophants and their enablers must consider the ramifications of their efforts to build a second Hollywood blacklist. It is important to remember that purging the memories of prominent figures usually never works. Even worse, it creates a cultural revolution whirlwind that often sweeps up the originators of the initial impulse.
Our solution to partisan disagreements should certainly not be a Stalinesque removal of all memories of political opponents. Such efforts show that the whitewashers are exactly what they accuse the president of being. The radical efforts of “damnatio memoriae” only increase the profile of the censored and showcase the inner tyrants of the left.

If this happens, Americans can wave goodbye to the dream of “draining the swamp.” If the conservative base loses faith in a Congress led by Republicans, what few legislative victories Republicans managed to achieve will end. The bold agenda undertaken by President Trump
will get bogged down by obstructionism from House Democrats. Divided government will once again rear its ugly head.
To avert defeat on Election Day, the Republican Party must focus on national issues. Former Speaker of the House, Tip O’Neill, coined the phrase “all politics is local.” While this may be true for Democrats, history tells us the opposite is true for Republicans, whose candidates win when they run on national issues rooted in principles of liberty.
Newt Gingrich and the “Republican Revolution” of 1994 are a case study in what happens when Republicans stick to big ideas. The “Contract with America” addressed major national issues like the budget and deficit, and stood in stark contrast to the lack of an appealing and coherent policy agenda by the Democrats. It also gave Republican candidates a national issue platform to focus on during the 1994 midterms. With this strong policy agenda as a rallying cry, the Republicans were able to retake the House and wield significant influence over the Clinton administration.
The Republicans running for office in 2018 should take a page from the 1994 Republican Party playbook. To paraphrase Congressman Thomas Massie
, there is a major difference between partisans and ideologues. Partisans have a narrow vision of what is good for the party. They deal in small scale legislative wins for political gain in the short term. Ideologues play the long game by taking a principled and measured approach to governing that pays dividends for the party down the road.
Republican leadership in Congress should take note. The “Republican Revolution” was successful in the long term because Republican ideologues governed on the promises made in the “Contract with America.” They stood on principle and took action. They kept their pledge to the American people, and voters rewarded them at the ballot box.
Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy
and his small scale and localized politics lack vision for the long term prosperity of America. His leadership strategy abandons all efforts to achieve substantive change in Congress and fixates instead on messaging bills that serve only partisan purposes.
This hollow approach to leadership is not going to cut it anymore. The Republican base does not want any more “balanced budget” show votes, “ObamaCare lite” health care proposals, or bloated omnibus spending bills written in secret. They want to see action on the small government campaign promises made repeatedly by Republicans.
The broken budget process is a glaring example of short game partisanship that frustrates voters. Every year, the leadership in Congress decides on a budget busting omnibus spending bill behind closed doors, and every year the national debt increases. All this happens with Republicans at the helm. Is this the party of fiscal responsibility?
During his tenure as Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan
became the poster boy for Republican Party reluctance to govern how it campaigns. If McCarthy takes over in the leadership, this will signal to voters that the majority is signing up for more of the same. The idea of more broken promises is not exactly motivation for voters to get to the polls.
To save the majority, Republicans need to rally around a principled ideologue with a strong national vision for change, like Congressman Jim Jordan
. He would govern how he campaigns on the trail, and that is on national issues that excite the conservative base. He is committed to restoring faith of Americans in the legislative branch. To put it simply, Jordan is ready stand for what voters what to see and #DoWhatWeSaid.
Like Gingrich did with the “Contract with America,” Jordan is running on a platform of national issues rooted in the Republican principles of fiscal responsibility. Like the 1994 party revolutionaries, Jordan is recognized by his colleagues as a fighter who makes the tough floor votes to cut spending and to limit the scope of the federal government.
These ideological principles drive Republican voter turnout at the polls. They did so in 1994, and they still do today. If Republicans can bridge the gap between how they campaign and how they govern, they will energize the base and pave the road to victory in November. If Republicans elect Jordan as Speaker and embrace his agenda of spending cuts, welfare reform, border security, and ObamaCare repeal, they will keep the House and lay the foundation for sweeping majorities in 2020 and beyond.

0,08/07/18 11:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/400625-treason-the-new-party-game-that-everyone-is-playing,Treason! The new party game that everyone is playing,"Here come the ghosts of Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohn. There is no longer room for reasoned debate in America. If you’re feeling uncomfortable and unable to defend your ideas, just censor all discussion with “I won't listen to this because… ,” “You're a Nazi,” “You’re racist,” or, most popular, “You’re a traitor/agent of Russia.” A great clincher to use any time: “I’m posting your address online.”
In this age of the Electronic Zombie Apocalypse and the instant proliferation and blind acceptance of crazy ideas, it hasn’t taken long for Treason! to catch on as the most popular party game around.
Here’s how to play: You pick names at random from a hat and proceed to complete this thought: “Treason! (Name from hat) is guilty of treason against America and should be jailed because …” (Of course, the hat is stuffed with extra “Donald J. Trump” cards and you can present any “evidence” available, even if it is totally made up.)
 Let’s give it a try.
First an easy one: Treason! President Trump
is guilty of treason and should be jailed because he gave an awkward and complimentary (to Vladimir Putin) press briefing in Helsinki. The Russians obviously have something on him! He is colluding with the Russians!
Another popular one: Treason! Hillary Clinton
is guilty of treason and should be jailed because she mishandled thousands of national security documents and made them available to Russian and Chinese government hackers; sold American uranium to Russia to make nuclear weapons in exchange for millions of dollars in speaking fees and contributions to the Clinton Foundation (haha, now defunct with no more uranium to sell); and buddied up to Putin and tried to create friendly relations with Russia through a “reset” policy.
Some more good ones:
Treason! Barack Obama
is guilty of treason and should be jailed because he subverted the Constitution, destroyed American institutions and illegally weaponized the IRS, FBI, and U.S. national security apparatus to spy on American citizens and disrupt an American presidential election; quietly told the Russian leadership that he would have more “flexibility” to give in to their demands after his re-election; and ridiculed 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney
for suggesting that Russia was a threat to the United States.
Treason! Former Sen. John Kerry
is guilty of treason (clearly in the aristocratic mold of Kim Philby) by being the only member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to vote against an amendment to the Magnitsky Act to require providing Congress with detailed justifications for keeping secret any names of human rights abusers, and by delaying action on Magnitsky, which punished Putin’s cronies and has been America’s most powerful political tool against the Russian leadership. (Of course, the Russia-leaning Obama White House rewarded Kerry with secretary of State for defending Putin’s interests.)
Treason! Former FBI director James Comey
is guilty of treason and should be jailed for deceiving the FISA court to spy on American citizens by using phony information obtained from Russian intelligence agents.
Treason! Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe
is guilty of treason and should be jailed for leading a conspiracy to use the FBI to launch an attempted coup against a newly-elected U.S. president.
Treason! Former National Intelligence director James Clapper
and former CIA director John Brennan
are guilty of treason and should be jailed for monetizing U.S. top-secret security clearances to leak secret information to the press and lying to Congress about it. NBC and CNN are complicit in that treason by paying for this information.
Treason! Special counsel Robert Mueller
and his investigative team are guilty of treason and should be jailed for using a now-obviously fictitious Russian collusion investigation to weaken American executive leadership and aid and abet Russian interests. Wow! The spy game really is a game of mirrors: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Special Prosecutor! Of course, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
gets a piece of this treason charge for using the probe to cover up his part in the FISA warrant debacle.
Treason! Rep. Adam Schiff
(D-Calif.) is guilty of treason and should be jailed for complicity in covering up and defending the treasonous actions of the Obama administration.
More obvious names in the hat: Bill Clinton
, former national security advisers Susan Rice and Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and campaign chairman Paul Manafort
, former attorneys general Eric Holder
and Loretta Lynch, former CIA director David Petraeus, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) — it’s just so easy to play, and don’t even get me started on the media and Hollywood. We could even nail Govs. Jerry Brown of California and Andrew Cuomo of New York for undermining the U.S. Constitution by allowing non-citizens to vote, fully corrupting the American democratic process.
Isn’t this fun? Let’s party like it’s 1954!

Richard Nixon, when threatened with impeachment, left office. Bill Clinton
got investigated and impeached and no one cared.
In Clinton's case, it's lucky for him that the investigation did not occur in a post-#Metoo world, or the outcome may have been significantly different.
Today, we are dealing with special counsel Robert Mueller
's investigation, which involves allegations that the Russians interfered — or at least tried to interfere — with the outcome of the 2016 election. So far, there has not been cause for concern for markets or investors.
 Mueller has not brought a major action against a U.S. citizen close to Trump. He indicted Paul Manafort
, but not for the original investigation’s mandate of finding those that were involved in manipulating election results.
Instead, after a year of work and millions of taxpayers dollars spent, Mueller brought a garden-variety tax evasion/money laundering case against Manafort that will be tried in two different states. The outcome is unknown.
Today, I bet Manafort wishes he had never met Trump. It's hell defending yourself against the unlimited resources of the U.S. government, but these trials also signal something to investors that should make them more confident that Mueller’s efforts will not result in anything that could damage markets.
If Manafort, as the head of the Trump campaign, had any hard evidence that the Russians dealt directly with Trump to manipulate the election, it’s highly likely he would have used that to negotiate a deal with investigators rather than risk years in prison.
The result of the Mueller/Manafort battle? Markets and their investors could not care less.
What would it take for Mueller to really affect market capitalizations? You have to handicap the probability that Trump is indicted, tried and found guilty of a crime that removes him from office.
That outcome would likely roil markets, but maybe only temporarily, as Vice President Mike Pence
would take over with the same pro-business mandate, with an administration that could be more traditional in terms of the current fanfare.
Markets assimilate this as an insurance policy, further reducing the chance that anything brought by Mueller could have a permanent effect on price-earnings ratios.
It's always difficult to successfully predict a black swan event like this. But as an investor that puts money in harm's way everyday, I think the probability of that outcome is less than 10 percent.
Mueller is working hard to find the truth, though not necessarily to bring down any one individual. At least that is his stated mandate. So how long could he go on for? Years.
Many forget that the Nixon investigation lasted three years until its historic outcome played out. By that standard, Mueller is only in the first trimester of giving birth to something material.
As far as the market is concerned, the longer the Mueller investigation goes on, the less risk that it brings a bad outcome for investors.
What about Trump being impeached for something other than the Russian investigation? Shouldn’t the markets care about that? Apparently not. Impeachments are just not what they used to be. Clinton proved that.

Local Member of Parliament (MP) John Glen told the Salisbury Journal that the vandalism was related to “other acts of anti-Semitism,” noting that “many people in Salisbury will be saddened to find out that the Holocaust memorial tree in Churchill Gardens has twice been vandalized in recent weeks. ... The latest acts of vandalism disrespect the memory of those who lost their lives in the Holocaust. They are also a further sign of a worrying trend in our society where extremism is increasingly drifting into the mainstream. We must redouble our efforts to ensure that antisemitism plays no part in our society and politics.”
It’s not just the uprooting of a memorial tree to dead Jews that worry the United Kingdom’s Jews but the uprooting of their legitimacy and safety in England.
 The hatred, which legitimizes clear and present dangers to British Jewry, has been emanating from what was the historic political home of British Jewry: the Labour Party. Now led by Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party denounced anti-Semitism with a definition that scrubbed the red line where legitimate criticism of Israel ends and anti-Semitism begins.
So, far from combating anti-Semitism, this Labour Party will give its blessing to party members who oppose Israel’s right to exist and who brand Jews as “Nazis.”
According to Dan Hodges in London’s Daily Mail, “Accusing Jews of being traitors to the U.K. will no longer be considered longer anti-Semitic, just a bit ‘wrong.’”  
Here’s a sampler of anti-Semitic gems emanating from Labourites:
A recent Facebook post by a Labour councilor, Damien Enticott, suggested that “Talmud Jews” kill Christian children to drink their blood.
At a 2015 campaign rally, Corbyn led a chorus of the “Red Flag” with supporters who said that Israel is responsible for ISIS. His supporters openly ranted about the “ugly Israeli species.” Corbyn mocked critics by appointing two virulently anti-Israel MPs, Kate Osamor and Sarah Champion, to lead the Party’s unconvincing effort to repair relations with the Jewish community.
At the Bear Pit, an outdoor popular venue in Bristol, a giant campaign banner showed Prime Minister Theresa May with Star of David-shaped earrings, a banner that some observers described as anti-Semitic. The banner listed positive statements about Corbyn and negative ones about May.
In March 2017, before former London Mayor Ken Livingstone was expelled by the Labour Party, he told reporters that there had been “real collaboration” between the Nazis and Jews. “[Hitler] didn’t just sign the deal,” Livingstone said. “The SS set up training camps so that German Jews who were going to go there (Palestine) could be trained to cope with a very different sort of country when they got there.” He refused to retract his statement that Hitler was “a staunch Zionist.”
In August 2017, at the popular Edinburgh Festival Fringe, U.K. political activist Jackie Walker appeared in her one-woman show, “Lynching,”  portraying herself as a martyr of a Zionist-orchestrated conspiracy. When faced by a torrent of Jewish protests, she “apologized” but did not retract her Farrakhan-inspired slander — that “many Jews were the chief financiers of the slave trade.” Walker, the former vice chair of Corbyn’s grassroots political army, Momentum, also said, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if Holocaust Remembrance Day was open to all people who’ve experienced Holocaust?”
In January 2018, Corbyn’s International Holocaust Memorial Day statement left out one word: Jew.
In March, Corbyn criticized the removal of British graffiti artist Kalen Ockerman’s “Freedom for Humanity” mural that depicted Jewish-looking businessmen and bankers counting money and playing monopoly on the backs of the poor. Corbyn expressed sympathy for the artist: “Why? You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera’s mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.""
In April, after 2,000 people marched on Parliament demanding action against anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, two Jewish leaders, Jonathan Arkush and Jonathan Goldstein, were invited to a sit-down with Corbyn. Arkush faulted him for “repeatedly [being] found alongside people with blatantly anti-Semitic views.”
On Passover, Corbyn attended a non-traditional Jewish Seder with a group that wants to do away with Israel. Later that week, Corbyn’s message was read outside 10 Downing Street condemning Israel’s “illegal and inhumane” actions against Palestinians protesting on the Gaza border. (Those protests/riots, organized by Hamas, featured firebombs, Molotov cocktails and burning tires.) Corbyn later refused to condemn Hamas for hundreds of rockets fired into Israel.
And now, one of Corbyn’s closest allies on Labour’s ruling body at a meeting attended by Corbyn, blames-not anti-Semites but Jewish “Trump fanatics” for bad PR. Peter Willsman also demanded “proof” from 68 rabbis, who warned Jew-hatred had become “severe and widespread” within the Labour Party.
Finally, Boris Johnson, a Conservative leader, has challenged Corbyn to put an end to his party’s mainstreaming of anti-Semitism. If he won’t, there’s little chance that the damaged Holocaust Memorial Tree — or British Jewry — will ever fully blossom again if Corbyn becomes the U.K.’s next prime minister.
In the meantime, be prepared for even worse to come from the Labour Party headed by the incorrigible Corbyn, who will be remembered by many as the spiritual heir of the U.K.’s goose-stepping Sir Oswald Mosley from the 1930s.

, who calls them “a total joke.”
As a Kennedy Democrat, my view is that when Trump clashes with the Koch brothers, the world is a better place. That's because the world more clearly sees the hypocrisy and phoniness that currently corrupts the great philosophy once known as conservatism.
One of the reasons I have repeatedly praised George Will, the conservative columnist at the Washington Post, is that he has stood up with clarity and conscience against the collapse of modern conservatism created by the politically reactionary and morally corrupt presidency of Trump.
 That is why I offered high praise to former President George W. Bush, no matter how much I disagreed with him throughout his career, for his sweeping and cogent criticism of the Trump presidency. 
That is also why I offered high praise to principled voices such as Joe Scarborough, Max Boot, Steve Schmidt and others who have spoken out, as Will has, with clarity and courage.
True conservatism is an honorable philosophy with which I have almost always disagreed. True conservatism is an honorable philosophy that believes in free trade rather than trade wars, strong border enforcement but not tearing immigrant children away from their moms and dads and putting them in cages.
True conservatism stands for reducing deficits rather than raising deficits to catastrophic and disastrous heights.
Make no mistake, George Will disagrees with most of the views I hold, but he represents a true, honest and principled conservatism that Trump is determined to destroy while many “conservatives” march in lockstep behind him.
The Koch brothers, by contrast with Trump, take certain positions that reflect an honorable conservative viewpoint. While I have supported a stronger trade policy than free-trade Republicans or Democrats, the Koch brothers are entirely right to oppose the reckless and radical trade wars that have defined the Trump presidency.
Similarly, America desperately needs an enlightened bipartisan immigration policy, which Democratic leaders and the Koch brothers are entirely right to champion and Trump is radically wrong to attack.
It is not surprising that the Koch brothers have come forth with criticism of certain wrongs of the Trump presidency. What is surprising is the degree that the authoritarian and intolerant Trump has chosen to personally and politically attack the Koch brothers.
I have known for many years prominent people across the ideological landscape of American politics, from the left to the right, but I have never known one person from either party who has described the Koch brothers as a “total joke,"" as Trump now does.
To many conservatives, the Koch brothers are heroes. To liberals, the Koch brothers are villains. That the Koch brothers would criticize Trump is a warning to conservatives. That Trump would attack the Koch brothers is a warning to Republicans.  
Most likely, the Trump-Koch feud will fade with a little time, but what if it becomes worse?
The Koch brothers might consider the clarity and courage of true conservatives such as George Will. He understands the dangers to America and to conservatism if Trump Republicans maintain control of Congress after the midterm elections.
Remember when conservatives stood for family values? Does Trump stand for family values in his personal life or with his cruel and callous breaking up of immigrant families?
Remember when conservatives stood for lower deficits? Don’t Trump and the GOP Congress realize they made a mockery of fiscal conservatism when their bloated tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations create mammoth budget deficits?
Remember when conservatives favored free trade? Don’t conservatives realize that the radically protectionist trade wars Trump wages are an attack on a core value of conservatism?
Remember when conservative leaders such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatched united the NATO alliance in defense of freedom against Russian attacks?
Aren’t conservatives humiliated to watch Trump say ad nauseam that there was no collusion with the Russian dictator who attacks democracy and now watch his mouthpiece Rudy Giuliani wrongly claim that even if Trump colluded with Putin it was not a crime?
Remember when conservatives were strong on defense and defenders of democracy? Isn’t it disgraceful to watch some conservatives tolerate or support Trump's repeated praise of foreign dictators and his disgraceful praise and submission in Helsinki to the Russian dictator who attacks America?
It will be fascinating to watch the Trump-Koch feud unfold as the midterm elections approach.
It is possible that Trump destroys Republicanism and conservatism for a generation. His supporters, in politics and media, need to begin a heartfelt conversation about what conservatism stands for.
George Will is right. The way to save conservatism and defend Americanism is to elect a Democratic Congress in November. When the Koch brothers feel compelled to strongly dissent from Trump and his supporters, something very powerful and important is happening in American politics.

Long before cyber threats, we dealt with planning for hazards such as natural disasters, disruptions at polling places and power outages.
Since August 2016, foreign interference in elections has been on the forefront of our minds. The 2016 election cycle highlighted challenges in communication and the importance of information sharing. While no votes were changed in 2016, we know the threat to election integrity remains.
Secretaries of State across the country, 40 of whom serve as their state’s chief election official, are working hard to safeguard the elections process by working with our information technology teams, private-sector security companies, the National Guard, the federal government, universities and many others. One of our strongest partners in this important mission has been the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
 When elections were first designated as critical infrastructure in January 2017 by outgoing DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, my colleagues and I opposed the designation. Not because we didn’t think that protecting our elections is imperative, but because we didn’t have a clear understanding of what that designation would mean.
We were concerned DHS and other federal agencies would begin to assert control over a process that is and should remain under the jurisdiction of state and local government.
We believe that our decentralized election system is one of the greatest protections in our democracy. However, the designation remains in place and thus state and local election officials have worked to ensure it is effective.
Thanks to the relationship many of us have developed with DHS, we have tackled the challenges to our election security together.
They have provided support through cybersecurity and physical assessment services, information sharing and educational opportunities to help us make our states’ election infrastructure more resilient than ever.
States have different systems and different needs, but we are all working hard to protect our elections process.
DHS has also worked with state and local officials to create a Government Coordinating Council (GCC), whose membership includes individuals from DHS, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), the Election Center and the International Association of Government Officials.
The GCC is the first group of its kind to help important stakeholders share vital information regarding the elections process.
In addition to the GCC, in February, the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC) was established. With all 50 states and nearly 1,000 local election offices as members, it serves as the hub of information sharing for election officials.
This free flow of information to election officials across the country helps us manage risk, identify counter measures and amplify security across the community.
As you can imagine, we learned a lot from the 2016 election cycle and that is why it is more important than ever to remain vigilant concerning the threats to our election infrastructure. Staying vigilant means staying aware of the threats while also remaining engaged and proactive in our partnerships.
On Election Day, DHS and the EI-ISAC will be running a centralized information sharing platform to support state and local election officials
The recent appropriation of $380 million in remaining Help America Vote Act funds will help us to enhance our security, update our systems and train our local election officials. We are grateful to Congress for appropriating these funds and to the EAC for disbursing them to all the states so expeditiously.
Beyond the 2018 elections, we will continue to work with federal partners, state, local, and private-sector election entities to promote strong cyber practices, including threat analysis through the EI-ISAC, cyber hygiene scans and phishing campaign assessments. States will supplement these tools with resources of our own that are unique to our needs.
We take the security of our elections process very seriously and we are working diligently to ensure that every defense available is utilized. To use the race analogy we hear often, we are not only in a sprint to November 2018, but we are also in a race with no end in sight.

0,07/30/18 11:45 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/399491-test-kims-intentions-to-find-out-if-this-time-is-different,Test Kim's intentions to find out if this time is different,"Is Kim Jong Un playing us? After two unprecedented face-to-face meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
came away arguing that Kim was about to make a “strategic choice” over trading his nuclear weapons for security and economic benefits.
Thus, unlike previous diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea, this time will be different.
But is it? How would we know? So far, there has been a deceptive sense of progress. To its credit, Pyongyang has taken some helpful steps:
 halting nuclear and missile tests;
blowing up a nuclear test facility that was on the verge of collapsing anyway;
destroying a ballistic missile test facility (no longer needed, as they completed their tests); and
working with the Pentagon to recover remains of Korean War-era soldiers reported missing in action.
The North cites these ""irreversible"" gestures of good faith, demanding the U.S. declare an end to the Korean War and build a ""peace regime,"" as agreed in the Singapore Summit joint statement.
So, when Trump says he is “very happy” with Kim’s cooperation, he does have a point. But on two fundamental issues on which the possibility of a successful deal advancing U.S. interests turns, there is nothing: economic reform and steps toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program.
The first is an important indicator of Kim’s intentions. The Kim family dynasty has, of late, defined its legitimacy as having nuclear weapons. They changed their constitution to define North Korea as a nuclear state.
But having declared that their nuclear and ballistic missile program is now complete, the argument is that Kim is prepared to put it on the table to gain economic and security benefits to modernize the decrepit North Korean economy and bring promised prosperity to his long-suffering people.
But is he? The word ""reform"" has yet to escape his lips. While Kim has indicated interest in — if not envy of — China’s economic reforms, he has yet to institute any market reforms from the top — even though widespread markets operate across North Korea compensating for inadequacies in its official economic system. 
Test Kim's intentions
But there is a simple, cost-free way to test Kim’s intentions. If he is serious about integrating North Korea into the regional economy, the U.S., South Korea (ROK) and China should tell Kim to begin talks with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and the World Trade Organization about joining these core institutions, which are essential if Pyongyang is to obtain large-scale foreign investment and build economic relations.
But Pyongyang’s budget and fiscal information are considered state secrets. So, this would be an important test of seriousness. In addition, the U.S. and ROK could help Kim modernize his economy by offering to train all the MBA’s, lawyers, accountants and technicians he is prepared to send us. For the U.S., it is a simple logic, anything that opens up North Korea is a win-win.
Similarly, we need to test Kim’s intentions on defining what he means by “denuclearization,” a question Mike Pompeo is now unable to answer.
How? Again, not difficult: The first step in any effort to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons program is for Pyongyang to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a full inventory of its nuclear weapons program and facilities so it can design a credible verification and monitoring regime. Absent that, we have absolutely nothing.
To be fair, in response to Pyongyang’s demand to create a peace regime, the U.S. can propose that Washington would be happy to initiate four-party talks (U.S., ROK, North Korea, China — signatories to the armistice) to negotiate an end to the Korean War and turn the armistice into a peace treaty as soon as Pyongyang provides the IAEA an inventory of exactly what its nuclear program consists of and allows the IAEA to set up an intrusive verification and monitoring system — as least as comprehensive as was done in Iran.
If North Korea does not respond to these initiatives, than they are telling us something very important: This time is not different. They are using the same old playbook to manipulate the narrative and deceive us.
At the same time, since the IAEA can only monitor the nuclear program, not dismantled nukes or shipped-out fissile material, the U.S. should call a meeting of senior technical experts from Northeast Asia’s declared weapons states — the US, China and Russia — to begin discussing how to actually dismantle North Korea’s program, disassemble nuclear weapons and remove fissile material form Korea.
Finally, to show our good will, the U.S. should invite Kim’s favorite musical group, the Moranbong all-women band, to perform at the Kennedy Center and the North Korean men and women’s soccer teams to play against the respective U.S. national teams. A modern version of ping-pong diplomacy!
These actions would allow the U.S. to change what is now a dangerous diplomatic dynamic and gain control of the narrative. Kim’s responses would tell us all we need to know about his real intentions.

We have seen Eric Greitens resign as governor of Missouri in shame when his ties to secret political donors came under scrutiny. The FBI is probing whether dark money from Russia was funneled through the National Rifle Association to help Donald Trump
get elected. Nonprofits are getting tens of millions of dollars, some of the biggest dark money contributions to date, from individual dark money donors.
Our campaign finance system is broken. More than $900 million in dark money was spent by powerful interests in the last five election cycles to influence federal elections. This secret political spending permeates our elections, poisoning our political culture, corrupting our government, and resulting in policy decisions that do not help Americans.
Americans increasingly are demanding that elected leaders reform the system to end secret and foreign spending, as well as undue influence from corporations. In good news, bold federal legislation known as the Disclose Act of 2018 has been introduced to make our political system more accountable and transparent, and to return power to everyday Americans. Congress should pass this legislation now if we want the upcoming midterm elections to reflect the will of the people.
How did we get to this lamentable point? By now, most Americans are familiar with the 2010 Supreme Court case called Citizens United. In its ruling, the court allowed unlimited corporate political spending, paving a path that has led to an influx of large donations to newly created super PACs and dark money nonprofits, many of which fuel negative campaign ads. Wealthy special interests often run their political spending through super PACs and dark money organizations so they can remain secret.
To make matters worse, foreign citizens and foreign governments have exploited our lax laws to improperly influence U.S. elections. The FBI is investigating, and congressional Democrats are probing, whether the National Rifle Association, which is among America’s largest dark money organizations, received secret money from Russian friends of Vladimir Putin during the last presidential election. If true, this was part of Russia’s brazen attempt to meddle in our domestic politics.
Americans must demand that foreigners be forbidden to hide their political spending behind shell corporations and be stopped from steering money to dark money organizations in the United States. The Disclose Act, sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse
(D-R.I.) and Rep. David Cicilline
(D-R.I.), would be a giant step forward toward sensible accountability and transparency. The legislation centers on disclosure, closing loopholes that shadowy political groups have exploited to hide their donors. The bill requires that organizations spending at least $10,000 on political ads must disclose the identities of their donors.
The Disclose Act also requires that organizations not only report more of their election ads to the public, but that they report promptly, so the public can know in real time who is pushing the negative messages that bombard us. The bill also strengthens bans on foreign political spending, particularly spending done through U.S. corporations. For example, U.S. corporations that are significantly controlled or owned by foreign entities would be prohibited from spending in U.S. elections. The legislation would also require more transparency from shell companies, which often are used to launder foreign money into elections.
The Disclose Act includes an updated “stand by your ad” provision, requiring leaders of unions, corporations and other organizations to identify that they are behind a political ad, just as candidates are required to do. Finally, the legislation repeals controversial partisan provisions that now thwart necessary campaign finance regulations, so the Securities and Exchange Commission and Internal Revenue Service would be freed up to finish new rules governing transparency for corporate political spending. The legislation would also remove the ban on federal contractors disclosing their political contributions as part of bidding processes.
Elections heavily influenced by special interests, corporations or foreigners lead to policies that do not reflect the will of everyday Americans, and they hurt disadvantaged and minority communities across the country. It is little wonder that Americans think the current system cannot fairly address important issues of the day. More disclosure will help turn things around, increasing public confidence that government officials are not in the pockets of big money interests.
Even former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative who helped decide Citizens United, supported transparency for political activities. He wrote that “requiring people to stand up in public for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.” We may not yet be doomed. But our system is undergoing an extreme stress test where officials are being corrupted by wealthy donors and foreign entities who influenced the 2016 election. It is time to demand bold solutions and hold secret political spenders accountable.

0,07/03/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/395363-donald-trump-is-truly-an-independent-president,Donald Trump is truly an independent president,"George Washington was our first independent president. Since then, presidents have been chosen from one of the two major parties. Independent candidates, such as Teddy Roosevelt running as a Bull Moose and Ross Perot, have occasionally garnered a sizeable chunk of the popular vote. But none from a third party ever won a significant number of electoral votes until the very unconventional election of Donald Trump
.
Last month, I was moderating a panel discussion when my friend Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University and former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, suggested Trump may be our nation’s first president from a third party. Elleithee‘s argument was that Trump defeated the Republican Party before defeating the Democratic Party by eschewing traditional political ideology and tapping into a growing resentment towards our government and economic institutions. While there is certainly some merit to the argument, I think it goes further.
In 2016, voters were feeling uncharacteristically uneasy. Motivated by a combination of domestic terrorism, illegal immigration, automation of the workplace, the Great Recession, the uneven recovery, stagnant wages, the rise of China, growing income inequality, the failures of public education, overcrowded jails, deteriorating public health, and the opioid crisis, voters felt extremely vulnerable. They no longer trusted institutions to look out for them, especially those run by the establishment.
When these factors prompted Trump to enter the race, he certainly could not be considered a conventional Republican, as he changed his party registration five times over the preceding 30 years. He went on to beat a field of 16 highly qualified Republicans, including senators and the scion of a political dynasty that had produced the two most recent Republican presidents. Trump took over the Republican Party by attracting independents and crossover voters into Republican primaries and running on his own heterodox platform of unconventional positions.
Then, despite tepid and at times wavering Republican establishment support, being massively outspent on paid media, and suffering overwhelmingly negative coverage on earned media, Trump went on to beat the Democratic establishment candidate in 2016. In this victory, he owes the Republican establishment donor base nothing, and he owes the party next to nothing. His victory was not their victory, although they were and continue to be supportive of some of his policy objectives, such as tax reform, regulatory reform, judicial appointments, and the military.
Trump the independent took over an unwilling Republican Party. After 18 months, he has earned more than 90 percent approval of Republican support for his governance. In the face of their losses and Trump’s successes, the Democrats of 2018 are splintering. Trump the independent is better positioned to connect with these disenfranchised voters than the failed Democratic elites or the defeated Republican elites.
If Trump can materially improve the standard of living for the forgotten men and women, he will enjoy the support of a very broad segment of the political spectrum, much broader than any prior leader percolating up from the system of two parties. Maybe that’s what frightens his critics the most. The never-Trumpers of the Republican Party, the far left, and the mainstream media are losing their collective minds over the prospect an ascendant Trump might succeed on an unprecedented scale.
As we celebrate our independence this July 4, we can disagree on policy. Our politics have always been a rough and tumble bloodsport throughout history, so vigorous debate on the merits is fair game. But, of late, things have gotten overheated. We the American people should all try to respect each other’s differing views and honor each other’s rights to express them. We are an American family. Working out our differences as we strive to be a united people is part of what makes our country great.
How can we help but marvel at the wisdom of our Founding Fathers, who provided us with this most unique form of government with checks and balances, that protects individual liberty against government tyranny, and relies on the consent of the governed through biennial national elections? Every two years, we can fire the entire House and one-third of the Senate. Every four years we can elect a new president.
It is no accident that we elected an independent president willing to challenge the establishment orthodoxy and the unrelentingly biased mainstream media. It is the proverbial thumb in their eyes. The Constitution works, and the American people have spoken. Give us the brash independent, and let us try things a new way.

0,07/02/18 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/394638-a-new-compact-for-the-fourth-of-july,A new compact for the Fourth of July,"Rarely on a Fourth of July has America’s future felt so insecure. Our sitting president was elected with a minority of the popular vote, in an election with meddling by a foreign power to influence U.S. voters. He shows virtually no respect for constitutional principles, or often, basic human decency.
Although President Trump
presents a serious problem, of greater concern is that he is a lagging indicator. He has snatched political success from the jaws of America’s fears: eroding confidence in democratic institutions; accelerating economic inequality and instability; and recharging the once tamped-down currents of nativism and racial bias.
Adequately responding to these foundational challenges demands nothing less than a new approach to democratic governance. We call that approach “community wealth building.”
 Community wealth building seeks to address root causes of our most fundamental inequities, while engaging us all in a process of change that appeals not just to an activist minority but to the aspirations of the majority. Community wealth building sees social change not as trickling down from Washington, but built boldly from the ground up through concerted action to tackle the common challenges that American communities, and the nation as a whole, might face.
Our vision of community wealth building sees economic and social policymaking rooted more firmly in the foundational tenets of American civilization: tolerance, pluralism and equality of opportunity. The first step in doing this work is telling the truth about our severe structural flaws, evident in both our founding and in our recent past.
The American story is both devastating and hopeful over the arc of over 400 years, and an honest look reveals an obvious truth: that “America,” land of opportunity for everyone, has never existed. Oprah Winfrey, Barack Obama
and Sonia Sotomayor are exceptions, not the rule. Millions are locked in institutional disparities as old as our republic.
Our willingness to confront our imperfections in search of a more perfect union is, and remains, a hopeful story. But we are lulled into dangerous complacency if we assume that because rights and opportunities have expanded over time, growth is inevitable and irreversible. Those expansions happened — haltingly — because of the mighty, often deadly, struggles of Americans determined to close the gap between our founding flaws and our democratic aspirations.
Today, our task is to build an inclusive, multicultural democracy that provides opportunity, community and security for all. That’s what community wealth building is about.
Community wealth building efforts are defined by four key features: inclusive community participation, on the front end; the establishment of bold equity goals; the use of holistic strategies encompassing physical, financial and human capital to build wealth for individuals and communities; and the use of inclusive economic tools and strategies that build on existing assets and bring more capital and resources into communities.
We are encouraged by numerous community efforts underway nationally to deliberately redress poverty and expand opportunity that reflect this paradigm. Shared Prosperity Philadelphia is one example. It was launched in 2013 with a focus on key poverty-reduction pillars, including workforce development, early learning for children and strengthening economic security and asset building.
Because Philadelphia’s Office of Community Empowerment and Opportunity is tracking metrics, stakeholders know they’re making progress against many of their goals — creating jobs, including jobs for low-skilled Philadelphians; improving individuals’ credit scores; increasing the number of financial institutions offering safe and affordable banking products and more. The community is an active participant alongside service providers, policymakers, the private sector, philanthropy and advocates, which deepens relationships and strengthens the fabric of the city.   
While there are many projects and promising examples, what has been missing in virtually all cases is sufficient resources and policy support to take these efforts to scale. Imaginative state and national policymaking, aimed not just at ameliorating the consequences of community problems such as underemployment but also tackling those problems at their source, can make a difference.
All Americans want to live in communities that provide employment opportunities, education, healthy public amenities, vibrant civic and social networks, and safety and security. A successful governing paradigm must demonstrate how democratic engagement and the political process can help communities achieve those goals, as directly and as tangibly as possible. Any alternative to President Trump — and more importantly, any effort to build an enduring and workable democracy — must comprehend the nature of this challenge.
This is a challenge we eagerly embrace. Indeed, we are hopeful because, as numerous communities have shown, we don’t need to wait for the next federal election to start bringing about real change.

Not to worry, said national security adviser John Bolton. Having the summit is a success, regardless of the results. In other words, success no longer is judged by any measurable achievement, but by process alone. It is a very Washingtonian view of the world.
Russian meddling in the 2016 elections will not be on the agenda. President Donald Trump repeatedly has stated that he doesn’t believe any meddling took place — thereby putting him in opposition to the unanimous conclusion of all four main Intel Community directors: CIA, FBI, NSA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence. He quotes Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denial of meddling as fact. In the 2015 Russian National Security Strategy, Putin identified the United States as an enemy of Russia. President Trump
, therefore, accepts the words of an avowed enemy of this country over that of his own government.
Other issues will have to be addressed, but American and Russian goals around the world have become diametrically opposed. In Syria, the United States wants the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, while Russia intervened in the country’s civil war to keep Assad in power. In Iran, the United States has withdrawn support for the Iran nuclear deal, hoping to isolate the mullahs in power; on the other hand, “The positions of Iran and Russia on regional issues are very close,” said Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. In November 2017, during his visit to Tehran, Putin described Russian-Iranian relations as “very productive.” Iranian military chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri confirmed close military ties between the two countries.
 In Ukraine, President Trump has intimated that sanctions should be weakened, calling for Russia to be readmitted to the G7. This might be welcomed in the Kremlin, since it would mean that Russia would pay no more than a minimal price for its aggression. On the war front itself, the United States wants to see peacekeepers along the border with Russia. Putin opposes this measure, stating the peacekeepers should only separate rebel forces from the Ukrainian army — assuring the rebel areas would remain independent. Other conflicts in the area — Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan — hardly register on the White House’s radar.
In Turkey, Russia is building gas pipelines and nuclear power plants, while selling the Turkish military S-400 missiles. By contrast, the United States is moving to cancel the sale of the F-35 joint strike fighter to Turkey. Further into the Middle East, the Trump administration is about to offer a plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace. Visiting Hamas officials in Moscow report that the Russians have agreed to oppose the American peace plan.
Probably the best hope for bilateral ties is Russia’s support for President Trump’s meeting with President Kim Jong Un of North Korea. While Russia has praised the recent Singapore summit, it has begun to throw a diplomatic wrench into future U.S.-North Korean talks. North Korea must have “absolute security guarantees” before Kim surrenders his nuclear arsenal, says President Putin. In meeting with North Korean and Chinese officials, it appears that Russia is trying to limit North Korea’s ability to take interim steps. The reason is not hard to fathom: as Russia continues to oppose NATO expansion on its western border, it would hardly be pleased with a country turning to America to its east.
America is attempting to pressure Venezuela’s leaders to change their anti-democratic ways, through the imposition of sanctions. Russia, however, continues to support Venezuela against all odds. President Nicolas Maduro has two Russian advisors, Denis Druzhkov and Fyodor Bogorodsky; they have helped the Venezuelans to launch the cryptocurrency the Petro. According to Time magazine, Putin personally signed off on the operation to help Venezuela avoid American sanctions.
North, south, east or west, American and Russian positions are in juxtaposition. One can hope that the two superpowers will find common ground to reduce tensions, but hope for compromise remains dim.

0,06/28/18 05:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/394682-recapturing-the-center-in-american-politics,Recapturing the center in American politics,"Last Tuesday at the National Constitution Center, two dozen of Philadelphia’s business leaders from across the political spectrum met with former elected officials, both Democrat and Republican. This was no smoke-filled room, however. The reason for the meeting, convened by the Commission on Civility and Effective Governance, was not to further some special interest or to seek tax breaks or regulatory relief. Rather, this group came together in an effort to improve our nation’s civic dialogue, reduce partisan gridlock, and begin to rebuild the great, moderate center of American politics that has guided our nation for over 200 years.
The problem was relatively easy to identify. Candidates from both parties spend most of their time vilifying the other side, in order to raise the obscene amounts of money needed to wage an effective political campaign in 2018. They then spend that money hurling more invective, to further energize and anger their base even more, thereby driving voter turnout.
Meanwhile, partisan media continues to preach to their faithful, misinforming them with one-sided narratives. Indeed, facts themselves are under continued attack, making it more and more difficult to discern fake news and propaganda from objective reality. The result of this dysfunctional dynamic is that elected officials are in no position to look across the political aisle for the compromises and consensus-building necessary to perform the most basic duties of government. If they do, gerrymandered districts and closed primaries will ensure that the most likely threat they face will come from even more extreme forces in their own party.
Solutions, admittedly, were more difficult to find. All seemed to agree that we must break the current cycle of hyper-partisanship and dysfunction if we are to restore our democracy, and get the responsive government we need. Beyond that, there was spirited conversation and a healthy range of ideas. I certainly do not speak for the entire group, or any individual member besides myself. What follows are simply some of the ideas we discussed to begin rebuilding the problem-solving center of American politics.
 First, stop funding its demise.  I am a proud Democrat, but when I get an email telling me that Republicans are trying to steal an election, or that they are all racist, and so I should send in five dollars to help stop them, I close my wallet. If all you offer is vitriol against the other side, if you do not have a positive vision for what you want to achieve, then you do not deserve to be supported as a candidate.  
We all must begin to question the stereotypes on which these pleas for cash rely, and instead ask the candidates who traffic in them how they will actually help lead a country that has a long and proud tradition of compromise for the sake of the common good.  
Second, engage with people and ideas with which you disagree. Turn to a news channel that that really bothers you, and listen carefully to what they are saying. Start to see the world through the eyes of someone on the other side of the political divide, and you may begin to see areas of common ground. You might even modify your view on some issue. Similarly, engage with people with whom you disagree. Trust in their intentions, even if you disagree with their conclusions.
Third, end gerrymandering. Gerrymandering creates safe, one-party districts in which politicians need only play to their hard-right or -left bases in primaries. Leaders elected from these districts then have little incentive to find real, practical solutions to the challenges the nation confronts.  
The recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling striking down the 2010 districts was a good step, but the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decisions to send gerrymandering cases back to lower courts in Wisconsin and North Carolina suggests that reform will have to come from the bottom up. Without voter support in favor of abolishing the practice of letting politicians pick their voters, rather than the other way around, we will always be subject to at the whim of partisan gerrymandering.
Fourth, open our primary elections. Right now in Pennsylvania, only registered members of a political party may vote in that party’s primary. As a result independents and moderates are often frozen out of the process for selecting candidates, and only get to participate in the general election, when the choice has been reduced to two extremists.
Fifth, explore alternative voting systems like the “top two” system and rank voting. These systems help to ensure that political candidates that appeal to the majority of voters in the middle of the political spectrum have a chance to be elected despite party affiliation.
None of these steps are easy, and none will solve our nation’s political dysfunction overnight. But just like the original “Miracle at Philadelphia,” enough concerted effort by people with the nation’s interest genuinely at heart, can restore our democracy and help to ensure our future.

0,06/28/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/394631-restoring-american-democracy-a-challenge-that-is-within-our-reach,Restoring American democracy a challenge that is within our reach,"Our democracy is at a crossroads. While Americans remain committed to the founding ideals of democracy, there is a profound crisis of confidence in our governing institutions and a shared perception that systemic issues such as racism and discrimination, as well as the influence of money in politics, are eroding the functioning of our democracy. As former President George W. Bush has said, “The health of the democratic spirit is at issue, and the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand.” It is a mission that unites our organizations and should unite us all as Americans.
New public opinion research conducted in the Democracy Project should give us cause for comfort but also real concern. Our study brought together bipartisan institutions and polling firms to survey American attitudes on the value of democracy at home and the support for these principles abroad. Our conclusions, drawn from 10 focus groups in five cities and a nationwide telephone survey, show that majorities of all races, genders, age groups, levels of education, income brackets, and political parties agree that our democracy is not delivering as it should.
This is especially true for members of minority groups, indicating that those historically underserved by American democracy appear to be the least convinced of its promise. It is significant given that minorities will become the majority in the next several decades. “The findings of the Democracy Project confirm we can’t take our freedoms for granted. We have to work for them, and we have to defend them,” former Vice President Joseph Biden said this week. “It is also a reminder that our democracy has never been perfect. We can’t be complacent if we hope to continue to lead in the 21st century.”
As the directors of three institutions that are committed to strengthening democracy at home and around the world, we believe the nation is at an inflection point in our own democracy. Although the frustrations Americans share are not new, our collective failure to address them more effectively increasingly risks undermining our democracy.
Our research tested over a dozen messages aimed at generating increased support for American democracy, and the message that resonated most across nearly all groups stressed both the danger of this moment and a call to service. The message read, “Today, there is a great need for us all to act as responsible citizens, things like voting, volunteering, taking time to stay informed, and standing up for what’s right, so that the freedoms and rights we cherish don’t get whittled away.”
Across the country, citizens are giving meaning to this message and taking powerful steps to restore the health of our democracy. We watched together as courageous students in Florida took a stand on our nation’s gun laws. We saw compassionate volunteers, business owners, and public safety officers flock to southeast Texas when Hurricane Harvey ravaged and flooded communities. We witnessed millions of women peacefully take to the streets to raise their voices, and we have been moved by individual acts of civic engagement and leadership.
The American public has a strong allegiance to defending our democracy, exemplified in such powerful acts of civic engagement. This carries over into a belief that the United States should do what it can to support democracy and human rights around the world. Our research showed that Americans, by a two to one margin, would prefer to increase rather than decrease government efforts to support democracy and human rights abroad. As one focus group participant said, “If we want to be this forerunner and represent idealistic democracy, we have to do this.”
One of the goals of this project is to encourage everyone who has a stake in our democracy — civil society groups, educators, businesses, elected officials, policymakers, indeed every citizen — to think critically about the challenges facing our country and take action to rebuild faith in fundamental democratic principles and institutions. We are committed to identifying ways through which we can mobilize public support and send messages more effectively on behalf of democratic ideals.
The strengthening of our democratic spirit will be challenging but is within reach. As President George W. Bush said, “Americans have a great advantage. To renew our country, we only need to remember our values.”

0,06/26/18 12:00 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/394173-supreme-court-hands-trump-predictable-win-on-travel-ban,Supreme Court hands Trump predictable win on travel ban,"The Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. Hawaii today was more than a predictable reversal of the 9th Circuit appeals court in its dubious ruling that the travel ban was unconstitutional. As some of us noted from the outset of this litigation, the precedent heavily favored President Trump
.
What was unprecedented was the degree to which courts relied on campaign statements and tweets by Trump to rule that the entry limits were based on religious animus. The ruling properly returns the courts, and others, to basic principles of legal process. Call it “The Red Hen moment” for the courts, where judges, appalled by Trump’s inflammatory and reckless comments against Muslims, refused to extend him the same deference shown to predecessors like former President Obama. The response from judges, however, seemed more visceral than analytical in ignoring the nondiscriminatory rationales cited by agencies for the policy.
The Supreme Court’s decision is, obviously, a major win for Trump, but it also is a major victory for those who believe courts must rule within the confines of the traditional record of review. CNN was quick to declare that this presidential order was “very different” from the original order. Despite my criticism of the original order — which was poorly drafted, poorly executed and poorly defended — it is not true that this decision was based on different questions. The challengers emphasized that the third order was based on the same threshold questions raised in the first order. The Supreme Court specifically hit the same flaw found in the first, second and third opinions, which was the reliance on the statements made by Trump on the campaign and over Twitter.
The Supreme Court ruled, “At the heart of their case is a series of statements by the President and his advisers both during the campaign and since the President assumed office. The issue, however, is not whether to denounce the president’s statements, but the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility.”
The dissenting justices still maintained that, regardless of the record created by the agencies, the president’s comments should be treated as dispositive as showing that the policy was “motivated by anti-Muslim animus.” There is little record that the agencies could create to overcome such statements in the view of the four dissenting justices. That is a dangerous approach for courts in reviewing policies and laws. It would allow jurists to pick from an array of public comments as determinative factors in review. While such comments have been given weight in racial gerrymandering cases and some other areas, the reliance by the 9th Circuit and the dissenting justices would have been unprecedented.
While many have correctly chastised Trump for departing from the traditional decorum and conduct of presidents, it is equally true that these courts departed from traditional review of courts in alleviating these comments over independent agency rationales. Notably, Chief Justice John Roberts and the majority clearly telegraph their disagreement with the president’s comments, as have many of us. However, this is about court decisions. It is not commentary. This is the point and always has been the point, from the first travel ban decision.
The lower court judges are not the only ones rebuked in this decision. The ultimate “Red Hen moment” was the order of former acting Attorney General Sally Yates
to bar Justice Department lawyers from defending the policy. Indeed, if anything, this was a “Red Hen moment” in Yates refusing service. The difference is that Yates denied a president the service of thousands of Justice Department lawyers in defense of a federal policy.
I was highly critical of the actions Yates took as acting attorney general and supported her termination on the basis of her order. Yates had only a few days left in federal service when she decided to take her unprecedented stand. That obstruction resulted in her being instantly declared a “hero” by Trump critics who ignored the implications of other officials in the future refusing to defend laws or policies more to their liking, from environmental protections to workplace safety laws.
It was manifestly untrue that there were not good faith arguments to support the policies as shown by dissenting lower court judges, and now a majority of the Supreme Court. Yates manufactured the conflict by ignoring review of the career staff of the Justice Department office of legal counsel, which found the president did, in fact, have the authority. Yates simply said that she was not convinced that the order was “wise or just” or “lawful.” She simply declared that she was acting on her duty to “always seek justice and stand for what is right.”
The Supreme Court decision upholding the travel ban is a shot across the bow of all lower courts that they must insulate themselves from the often incendiary comments of this president. The question is not how he views his office but how judges view their own.

0,06/26/18 09:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/394117-prepare-to-be-disappointed-with-russia-investigation-conclusion,Prepare to be disappointed with Russia investigation conclusion,"For those hoping the conclusion of the Russia probe will finally help put the controversial 2016 election behind us, prepare to be disappointed. Nobody beyond special counsel Robert Mueller
’s team knows exactly what evidence has been found that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. We may learn there was no indication that President Trump
personally did anything illegal. Or Mueller may lay out rock solid proof of a criminal conspiracy or other violations that causes a chain reaction leading to the downfall of the Trump administration.
However, based on what we know to date, the most likely outcome will be something frustratingly in between. Barring a major deviation from Justice Department policy, Trump will not be indicted. The unique role of the president calls for a unique remedy to punish wrongdoing: impeachment under Article II of the Constitution. This would require a majority in the House to impeach and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict. Upon conviction, the sole punishment is removal from office.
As a result, impeachment is a political remedy rather than a legal one, with members of Congress closely watching public opinion polls as they decide the fate of a sitting president. So as a practical matter, any evidence will effectively need to meet the highly subjective standard of whether it merits removing a president from office, which is something that has never happened in American history.
We have only to look to the 1998 impeachment of former President Clinton to see how this has played out in the past. Clinton was impeached for lying to a federal grand jury and prompting witnesses to do the same. Following his trial in the Senate every single Democrat and several Republicans voted against conviction. Did they do so because they thought he was not guilty? No. It was because they decided that lying about sex did not justify removal of a president twice elected.
The issue for Trump will not be whether he engaged in conduct that could theoretically be prosecuted. The real question is what it will take to turn public opinion against him and prompt a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate, including some Republicans, to remove him.
Let us assume the worst about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting. Say members of the Trump campaign met with an attorney they knew represented Moscow and who promised to provide opposition research on Hillary Clinton
. Let us also assume that candidate Trump learned of the meeting either in advance or after the fact, and later authored the public statement that falsely described its purpose. Yet, barring some evidence that has not yet come to light, there is nothing to indicate that anything of value was actually given to the Trump campaign by Russia as a result.
So we potentially have a case of “attempted collusion,” coupled with a ham-handed attempt to lie about it to the public. Is that illegal? Potentially. Could federal prosecutors build a campaign finance or other criminal case on these facts? Most likely. Will two-thirds of the Senate convict and remove President Trump on this basis alone? Absolutely not.
What about Mueller investigating potential obstruction of justice? We know he is looking at whether Trump pressured former FBI Director James Comey
to end the investigation of Michael Flynn, and whether the president’s subsequent firing of Comey was meant to obstruct the FBI’s Russia investigation. We have seen reports that Mueller is investigating the fact Trump has considered firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions
, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein
, and the special counsel himself.
Yet, the Flynn prosecution continued unmolested. The FBI’s Russia investigation moved forward despite Comey’s removal. Sessions, Rosenstein, nor Mueller were terminated. If Mueller brings forth proof of a quid pro quo between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, or evidence of document destruction, lying, witness tampering, or other conduct clearly intended to prevent investigators from getting to the truth, the president’s public and congressional support will collapse.
But if the best Mueller comes up with is circumstantial evidence of crimes that would require creative legal theories to prosecute, Trump voters will not be swayed. Will two-thirds of the Senate convict a president for “attempted obstruction” on a theory of corrupt intent based on comments he made to Lester Holt and the Russian foreign minister? Not likely.
This is not to say the president will escape without consequence. The Trump Tower meeting demonstrated horrendous judgment and a willingness to violate the law. Paul Manafort
should not have been allowed anywhere near a presidential campaign. The same goes for Flynn, whose baggage made him clearly unfit for a senior White House position. All of this and more will likely be described in scathing detail by Mueller and will reflect poorly on the president, his family, and those he associates with.
Back in 2016, Republicans hoped that Hillary Clinton would be taken down by the FBI’s investigation into her email server. Trump’s critics should not make the same mistake. It is certainly possible that Mueller is sitting on blockbuster evidence that will lead to the end of this administration. However, based on what we know so far that is not likely. Do not hold out hope for a legal solution to the Russia matter. This is a political issue that will require a political resolution the hard way at the ballot box.

0,06/26/18 08:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/394102-why-the-red-hen-incident-so-troubles-us,Why the Red Hen incident so troubles us as Americans,"The United States of America is creeping toward creating a more imperfect union, one dominated by the power of the online mob that is threatening to disassemble more than 200 years of learning.
It was in “Federalist 10” that James Madison, the father of the Constitution, discussed the human tendency to divide into factions, which he defined as groups of people “who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens” and to the community. He warned how the zeal for certain government policies, for passionate leaders and for different religions could lead us to a society inflamed “with mutual animosities.”
Welcome to America 2018. Madison’s solution then was to tame the forces of the moment through a republic as opposed to a pure democracy. This is done by electing the people’s representatives from across the country who would be more sensible and objective. They would face periodic elections, but were to be freed from the easily inflamed mobs that would be quick to trample the rights of others.
But in the modern age, as I document in “Microtrends Squared,” people are increasingly divided into factions, and whether it is through their news channels or their Twitter feeds, the ability to whip up crowds quickly and with slanted information has never been easier, or more dangerous. Forget about the Russians dividing us, we have to worry about us Americans doing the job of tearing the nation apart.
Our politics itself has turned so negative that today’s political consultants often do little more than comb through opposition research reports for some infraction from 20 years ago that they can exploit through negative ads, which dominate our political scene. It has proven all too easy to inflame factions than to lead with new ideas.
Protest is, of course, an important part of our society, and we have had huge protests throughout the years that have made a difference. During the Vietnam War, when the lives of 58,000 Americans were lost, we had protests joined by millions that eventually brought down President Lyndon Johnson. Yet, society itself remained civil as we changed course.
Despite having been entirely peaceful, the incident at the Red Hen restaurant is unsettling because its goes to the core of how we treat those with whom we disagree in this republic. To be shamed with your family in the middle of a meal because of your service to the country and for your political views means that there is no activity safe for those who work for or, by extension, who just voted for or supported the opposing party. The Red Hen incident crossed the line from just words to actions by ejecting White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her family.
Yes, President Trump
instituted an immigration policy that was wrong. In many ways, the system worked and caused him to reverse a highly unpopular policy within a week. Yet, in the process, inflammatory language comparing the administration to Adolf Hitler and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to Nazis undermined those who sincerely opposed the policy as unjust.
Social media unfortunately makes it all too easy now to inflame factions and to organize mobs online, and even call on them to converge in person in a speed that has never been possible before. If this keeps up, Rep. Maxine Waters
(D-Calif.) will achieve her goal of harassing Cabinet members wherever they shop, dine and eat. Her remarkable attack on civility has little support among the public, and it was encouraging to see some major Democratic political leaders like Sen. Charles Schumer
(R-N.Y.) reject it. He called harassing Cabinet members “un-American.” Even the Washington Post editorial page opposed her prescription.
In the latest Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, 72 percent say it is wrong to eject someone from a restaurant for their political views. Only two jurisdictions in the United States explicitly make it illegal to discriminate in restaurants on the basis of political affiliation. One of them is the District of Columbia, but the Red Hen owner is likely safe from legal process in Virginia. Left unchecked, all this could easily spiral out of control. Why stop at Cabinet members? Imagine restaurants and hotels with “Democrats Not Served Here” signs. Today, that would be perfectly legal in most places.
Another growing problem is the stigmatization of people at work for their political views. In a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll last year, 40 percent said they were afraid to express their true political views with family or at work because of potential retaliation. While the First Amendment prevents Congress from penalizing people for what they say, it does not prevent your employer from firing you for your politics. Once again, a raging online mob can get almost any employee fired in short order.
We have to fix this before it gets out of hand, and not just with editorials, but with legislation. We need to extend the First Amendment to the workplace so that no one can be fired for their politics. The failure to enact this basic protection makes the First Amendment meaningless, except for those who can afford to lose their jobs, are students, retired, or who only say what is popular in their part of town.
Then we need legislation to make discrimination at restaurants for political views illegal so that no one is humiliated when they take their family out to eat. Public accommodations need to be just as open in Northern Virginia to Trump supporters as coffee shops in West Virginia are to Clinton supporters. Maybe they don’t have to bake custom cakes, but they have to serve them without discrimination.
We need to require higher standards of verification for negative ads and encourage politicians to run more on what they are for rather than just what they are against. There is no obvious cure for the ability of social media to divide us beyond at least weeding out fake accounts and creating accountability for political ads. But much shaming and bullying online is done proudly to gain approval from our factions. As many as 80 percent in many polls find Trump’s tweets and personal attacks divisive at a time our leaders need to bring us together.
This is not just about a lack of civility. It is about the core values behind our Constitution and the American spirit that welcomes peaceful political diversity at the center of creating a “more perfect union,” even when we grapple with the toughest and most emotional of issues or with leaders and parties that exploit rather than heal our divisions. We are a dynamic society living materially better than at any time in history. Yet, if we do not observe our own red lines, we will go down the very path of division and retribution that Madison warned us about.

It’s part of a growing pattern of intimidation and mob scenes against Republican officials. Grass-roots activists share in the blame, of course, but the largest single accelerant is the mainstream media.
The rinse and repeat cycle of anti-Trump outrage blared on nearly every news network, magazine and newspaper has fomented an increasingly brazen brand of radical ideas turning into radical action.
Last week was a turning point. And certainly not in a good way for anyone — the administration, the media, Republicans or Democrats.
 The headlines and Twitter feeds have become one recycled (and often artificial) tempest outrage after another. Biased anchors and editorial rooms create a bellows effect of turning isolated incidents or policies of years prior into white-hot cauldrons of outrage. The over-the-top kabuki-theater-type “coverage” of family separations at the border acts more as undisguised activism than objective reporting. If House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) handed a check to a TV anchor on set, it would be less subtle.
Every new affront ratchets up the already-tense leftist base and riles up Republican RINOs. Except the fury doesn’t match the underlying issues. The Trump border policy, coupled with enforcement of provisions dating back to George W. Bush, has been willfully extrapolated to extremes by the people who should be refereeing political debate. Instead, we have, for example, a deceptive (to put it charitably) TIME Magazine cover and mental gymnastics to hide President Obama’s own family separations and child cages, all funneling red meat (or a non-cruelty tofu substitute) to the Resistance base.
This miscarriage of responsibility has — and will have — real-world ramifications.
The maelstrom reached a crescendo Thursday due to Melania Trump
’s jacket. One newspaper headline declared her an “Agent of Coat Chaos.” Her sin? Wearing an off-the-shelf jacket with the words “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” while boarding a plane to Texas.
Her trip to comfort children was overshadowed by her jacket. Her jacket.
She didn’t even wear the article of clothing while meeting with weeping children or with government officials. She was snapped wearing it while boarding a plane. Many on the left rightly dismissed criticism of Michelle Obama
’s wardrobe — and they should stand up for this first lady’s agency to wear what she wants, when she wants to.

There are so many other things our news media can focus on, much of it positive. The unemployment rate matches the lowest level in 50 years. Black unemployment is at the lowest level in recorded history. GDP growth may now be at 4 percent. North Korea is removing anti-U.S. propaganda. It’s not all sunshine and lollipops, but stepping out the door into the real world reveals a much rosier picture than the television portrays.
Simply put, the legacy media has destroyed much of the middle ground for debate. They’re playing brinkmanship with President Trump
, each stacking another joker on an impossibly high house of cards. Now, with the death of Charles Krauthammer and the sidelining of mainstream Republican thinkers from polite society, the issue is only getting worse.
In selling the Iran Deal with lies, President Obama’s deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, Ben Rhodes, famously said afterward: “The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.” In the age of Trump, this is happening writ-large.
Conservatives aren’t perfect. And the owner of The Red Hen had the legal right to refuse service to Sanders. However, this sort of chaotic behavior is now mainstream only on the left: Sen. Marco Rubio
(R-Fla.) was shouted down in Florida; Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen
was howled at as she ate in a restaurant (with bonus outrage points that anyone linked to Trump would eat at a Mexican joint); Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was heckled while trying to watch a documentary on Mr. Rogers. (Perhaps the mob didn’t get the whole point of Mr. Rogers.)
Rep. Maxine Waters
(D-Calif.) poured gasoline on the fire, calling for more. A member of Congress playing a wink-and-nod game with mob violence lends a dangerous legitimacy to an already-tenuous situation.
This process of righteous outrage is not sustainable. In many ways it reminds me of the growing storm of surprise after the 2016 election, pussy hat protests and faux civil disobedience last summer that culminated in the attempted assassination of Republican congressmen in Washington and the severe wounding of Rep. Steve Scalise
(La.).
There is room for discussion, even still. Congressional Republicans have been surprisingly flexible in allowing ideas to the floor this term, and I hope Democrats take them up on the offer. The debate belongs in conference halls, meetings, respectful discussions. It shouldn’t take place scoring imaginary virtue points by kicking out your political opponents — left or right — from your establishment.
It’s time for a mutual de-escalation before things get worse. The media can, and should, take a leading role toward reconciliation. Our differences are far smaller than what we have in common. Our shared goals, heritage and future wait in front of us. Fortunately, we have a political system that allows us to do so.
Let’s do so, even when we disagree. In fact, let’s do so especially when we disagree.

What better way to mark it than this administration’s failed, repugnant use of migrant children as political hostages in an immigration debate?
The issue 64 years ago was Sen. Joseph McCarthy, described as “the accidental demagogue” in David Halberstam’s masterpiece, “The Fifties.” The Wisconsin Republican dominated political discourse for four years by railing about a communist “deep state,” discrediting institutions (such as the federal government, entertainment industry and the media), hurling personal attacks, brazenly disregarding facts, sowing fear and distrust.
Sound familiar? McCarthy drew vehement support from right-wing base voters but, by 1954, many Americans began to tire of his cruelty. A McCarthy fatigue was setting in. In March of that year, Edward Murrow threw a devastating punch. He used the entire half-hour of his CBS television program, “See It Now,” to methodically catalogue McCarthy’s fear-mongering and inconsistencies.
At the end of that program, Murrow spoke directly to the camera, “This is no time for men who oppose Sen. McCarthy’s methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.”
More than 12,000 viewers spontaneously called CBS, with a ratio of 15 to one expressing support. His popularity ebbing, McCarthy used a tactic since mastered by President Trump
to regroup: Change the narrative by launching a new attack. Now the communist enabler was none other than the United States Army. The Army, in turn, accused McCarthy and his counsel, Roy Cohn (who later mentored Donald Trump), of seeking favorable treatment for an associate who’d been drafted.
The Senate held hearings. The stage was set. On June 9, 1954, ABC televised the 30th day of the hearings. By then, McCarthy’s arguments had been effectively disassembled by the Army’s chief counsel, Joseph Welch. Then the senator charged that lawyer Frederick Fisher Jr., an associate in Welch’s own law firm, was tied to the Communist Party. In front of a national audience, Welch responded, “Until this moment, senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” He went on to ask, “Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?”
McCarthy continued fruitlessly to engage on Fisher’s association, but the damage was done. Welch refused to answer any more questions on the subject and excused himself from the hearing. The audience burst into applause. It was an “emperor has no clothes” moment, from which the emperor, McCarthy, never recovered. Murrow and Welch didn’t end his career, but they helped to bring America back to its senses.
Now we confront new indecencies. The indecency of snatching babies from parents at a border and creating military detention centers for children. The indecency that embraces a pathological North Korean dictator who starves and murders his own people, while poking traditional allies and shirking liberal democratic values. The indecency of taking a battering ram to our institutions, particularly the free press and the judiciary, for the sole purpose of weakening their ability to resist. The indecency of the many new “Roy Cohns” who advise, consent to, or help propel a dark and malicious agenda.
Undoubtedly, the 1950s were more hospitable to the likes of Welch and Murrow. Gerrymandering hadn’t yet pulled the Republican Party to the right of Genghis Khan. There was no Fox News to support McCarthy unconditionally while smearing Murrow and Welch. But these two men remind us that methodical argument and sharp clarity can pierce hysteria and define demagogues.
Within months of their appeals to our collective consciences, McCarthy was censured by the Senate, and his decline was complete. History remembers him as an embarrassment and his movement as despicable. Perhaps that’s the fate of President Trump and his enablers. Perhaps if a Welch or a Murrow arises with an ability to capture Trump’s indecency in a clear, coherent, resonant way, Trump’s craven indecency will join the history books next to McCarthy’s, where it belongs. We’re waiting.

President Trump
’s “zero tolerance” policy directs the Justice Department to prosecute migrant adults, thus separating them from children they may be traveling with. The children are given over to either a U.S. relative’s home, foster care, or a juvenile facility.
Initially, Trump stated that he had no desire to sign an executive order regarding the issue. He urged Congress to pass legislation that would change immigration with longevity and permanence, something past administrations were unable to accomplish. However, as pressure rose worldwide for immediate action, fellow Republicans, even his daughter and wife, advocated for a rollback of the policy.
While the executive order that Trump signed last week ameliorates this issue, executive orders like these are akin to a Band-Aid on a gunshot wound. Indeed, Barack Obama
utilized the power of his signature 276 times, including on immigration. His use of the executive order to enact policies allowed for them to be easily overturned.
Executive orders are not how our nation should be making laws. The only way to solve the problem of amoral family separations, in truth, is through a bipartisan congressional compromise in the form of increased border security in exchange for a pathway to citizenship.
The bill that the House will vote on this coming week is precisely what Democrats should want. Simply, it is a trade of more funds dedicated towards securing the southern border in exchange for a clearly defined pathway for foreign nationals to become citizens.
In an era where political polarization is at a fever pitch, every effort must be made to promote and enact policies made that involve members across the aisle. Unfortunately, many Democrats have taken inflammatory positions and will likely obstruct the bill at all costs.
Even so, the bill as is will be dead on arrival in the Senate. But opposing and obstructing this bill only hurts those that Democrats are trying to help. Now more than ever, Democrats and Republicans must work together, reach across the aisle and achieve legislative compromise.
Hurting the cause are Democrats like Nancy Pelosi
who are blind to the fact that their rhetoric only serves to divide both their party and the nation, and will prove costly in the upcoming midterm elections. “It may be a compromise with the devil, but it’s not a compromise with the Democrats in terms of what they have in their bill,” Pelosi said.
The increasingly forceful language used by the Democrats has pervaded the party. Cynthia Nixon, a candidate for governor of New York, was quoted saying that she believes that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a “terrorist organization.” Comments like these are not only absurd but will only embolden Republican voters come November.
If the rhetoric on both sides shifts from abusive to explanatory, Democrats and Republicans would be able to further their party’s goals, pass policies, and ensure Americans get the reforms they deserve. Most importantly, it would make the 2020 election about policies rather than politics.
There is much to gain for both sides, but any progress would have to be a result of Democrats putting aside the compulsive need to obstruct purely because the immigration bill is a Republican proposal.
To be sure, Republicans must also be willing to make concessions and compromise. During the Clinton administration, the cornerstone of our philosophy was to compromise. It is how we reduced the debt, balanced the budget, and passed bipartisan immigration reform.
While Trump said Republicans in Congress should stop wasting time on immigration until after the midterm elections, making compromise doubtful, the debate over this issue does not need to continue to devolve.
Immigration is surely an issue where Republicans and Democrats can make reasonable concessions to produce effective reforms for the American people. Compromise is progress for all, and on an issue like immigration, both sides of the aisle can walk away with a win.

Krauthammer, who died Thursday, was a diehard Nats fan (a self-described “rehabilitated Red Sox fan”), and he was my friend. Despite our otherwise diametrically opposed baseball allegiances and some differing political opinions, I was proud to hear those words because I was always proud to be with Charles, whether at a stadium or a television studio.
He was one of the most intelligent and honest men I have ever known. From baseball teams to politics to his own physical state, Charles led a life of change, breaking away and rebuilding with every new generation. He succeeded out of sheer will and a type of quiet passion. His was a life of growth and discovery. And, for the many of us who knew him or followed his writings, there was a genuine genius to his 68-year journey.
Two weeks ago, Charles penned a goodbye note to his family, friends and fans. It was vintage Charles: unadorned, honest, direct. After explaining that an aggressive form of cancer had returned, he shocked the world by saying that he had just weeks to live. He ended with these words:
“I believe that the pursuit of truth and right ideas through honest debate and rigorous argument is a noble undertaking. I am grateful to have played a small role in the conversations that have helped guide this extraordinary nation’s destiny. I leave this life with no regrets. It was a wonderful life — full and complete with the great loves and great endeavors that make it worth living. I am sad to leave, but I leave with the knowledge that I lived the life that I intended.”
Charles lived a life intended but unplanned. He faced obstacles that would seem insurmountable but always had a confidence about the correct, often unplanned path. Charles was born in New York City in 1950 in a Jewish Orthodox family. His father was from Ukraine and his mother was from Belgium. They would move to Montreal and, early in his schooling, Charles stood out as a brilliant mind. He graduated from McGill University with first class honors and then studied at Oxford University. He was then admitted at Harvard Medical School.
While a first-year student, Charles was paralyzed below the neck in a diving accident. After 14 months in the hospital, Charles returned in a wheelchair and later became a resident in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. Despite being paralyzed, he quickly rose as a star in psychiatry. He would publish groundbreaking work on the study of mania and coined the term “secondary mania” as a type of manic depression.
Krauthammer’s life took another turn in 1978 when he started to write for that liberal iconic publication, The New Republic. Yes, Charles Krauthammer was once a classic liberal. He even served as a speechwriter for Walter Mondale. His writing style and penetrating analysis quickly became a sensation and soon he was writing for the Washington Post, leading to a Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1987 and a position as a television commentator on PBS “Inside Washington.” Charles continued to defy expectations and assumptions, both physically and politically. His analysis moved him gradually rightward. He would be credited with the first broad treatment of what became known as the “Reagan Doctrine.”
Charles was now one of the most influential thinkers of his generation. (Even Bill Clinton
called him a “brilliant man,” to which Charles quipped that his career was officially “toast.”) He later answered the most common question about his intellectual evolution this way: “I was a Great Society liberal on domestic issues. People ask me, ‘How do you go from Walter Mondale to Fox News?’ The answer is, ‘I was young once.’ End of answer.”
Charles continued to eschew labels, often speaking in a voice that was both intellectual and irascible. His take on stem cell research was illustrative: “I am not religious. I do not believe that personhood is conferred upon conception. But I also do not believe that a human embryo is the moral equivalent of a hangnail and deserves no more respect than an appendix.” Charles called himself a “psychiatrist in remission,” and his writings often reflected his view of human experience.
Charles remained a contrast of the rivaling forces in his life and his writings. He had the most inquisitive, active mind of anyone I knew despite being anchored to a wheelchair. He had seats at the Nats that allowed him access to the games. We would discuss kids and politics and, always, baseball. We would watch the game gently unfold as we discussed the world around us. Baseball was a profound experience with Charles. He said that he loved baseball precisely because it was a slow, “complex, cerebral game that doesn’t lend itself to histrionics.”
Complex, cerebral, and no histrionics. Just like Charles Krauthammer.

0,06/22/18 08:30 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/393591-with-supreme-court-punted-on-gerrymandering-states-must-act-now,"With Supreme Court punting on gerrymandering, states must act","On Monday, the Supreme Court opted not to address the substantive issues surrounding extreme partisan gerrymandering. This result is disappointing for those, like me, who hoped the court would rule that drawing districts for primarily partisan purposes could be unconstitutional. Now, the onus for action is on the states to stop gerrymandering for political purposes and to end its destructive impact on our democracy. The time to act is now — before new districts must be drawn following the 2020 census.
As citizens we should all care deeply about fair elections. They are critical to the survival of our democracy. Gerrymandering for political purposes distorts our democracy by crafting election districts that reward hyper-partisan candidates at the expense of candidates who must listen to all voters to get elected. If you live in a gerrymandered district and you are an unaffiliated voter or a member of a political party that is different than the one favored by gerrymandered district lines, most often your vote does not matter to the outcome of who gets elected. The election of your representative is determined in a party primary in which you likely cannot participate.
 Further, the person elected to represent you is accountable only to members of the his/her party and does not really have to listen to your concerns. The voices of all the people are not heard, and more and more voters become disengaged from the election process. Our national dialogue suffers and gridlock in Congress and state legislatures is exacerbated. The results undermine faith in our democratic system of government and have made it nearly impossible for our government to solve the many big problems we are facing.
Yet, in spite of the risks posed by partisan gerrymandering, it is both unlikely and unwise for the courts to prescribe exactly how states must draw their districts. Instead, guidance from the courts will at most define approved methods or tests for determining whether extreme partisanship entered the redistricting process and, if so, order that districts be redrawn. Since passage of the Voting Rights Act, redistricting has been the subject of constant litigation, creating great uncertainty for voters and politicians, and costing taxpayers significant amounts of money that is needed to address other problems.
This week the high Court sent the case before it from Wisconsin back to the lower court to allow the parties to address issues of whether the parties bringing the case were harmed such that they had standing to challenge the district lines. The Maryland case, also before the Court, was sent back as well to the lower court without any decision on the merits of the claims. Rucho v. Common Cause, a similar case out of my home state of North Carolina, is still before the Supreme Court and could be heard during the Supreme Court’s next term.
But even if the Court rules on the North Carolina case and decides to implement a strict legal test to assess whether gerrymandering directly injures the voting power of voters in a particular district, solving the partisan redistricting problem will still require state-led reform.
In light of Monday’s ruling, states should take the initiative to adopt nonpartisan processes for drawing election districts. Such reform efforts aren’t just pie-in-the-sky good government idealism. By putting in place clear standards, rules, and criteria for how district lines are drawn, partisanship can be effectively minimized. What is important is that map drawers not consider partisan registration data, voting history data, or any other “proxy” data that indicates how citizens are likely to vote. Districts resulting from such processes are likely to be more competitive: thus, politicians must appeal to all voters to get elected, and they are rewarded for solving problems and not for partisan rhetoric and refusal to compromise.
Voters across the country and across the aisle support non-partisan redistricting. A number of states have already implemented non-partisan processes to establish election districts. Many are well on our way to making it happen. New 2018 ballot initiative efforts are advancing in Michigan, Utah, Missouri, and Arkansas, and elsewhere. Action is more complicated in states where citizen ballot initiatives are not allowed. But that doesn’t mean the effort is futile!
In North Carolina, we are well underway in our effort to push the state legislature, the General Assembly, to act. I serve as the co-chair of North Carolinians for Redistricting Reform, and our strategy is to rally North Carolinians to urge the General Assembly to put a state Constitutional amendment on the ballot for voters to decide if they want a new, non-partisan process for drawing the districts in which their representatives are elected instead of the increasingly partisan process.  
In the absence of a ruling from the Supreme Court and ahead of the 2020 redistricting cycle, now is the time for states to act. Action is needed to reengage voters, and to protect and preserve our democracy.

0,06/21/18 04:30 PM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/393509-leave-electoral-fairness-questions-to-the-voters-not-the-courts,"Leave electoral fairness questions to the voters, not the courts","To almost no one’s surprise, on Monday the Supreme Court avoided ruling on the constitutionality of gerrymandering by state legislatures. By so doing, the Court avoided, at least for the time being, straying even more deeply into the political thicket of voting and representational equality first entered under Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1960’s. Then the Court found that the 14th Amendment, adopted in the 1860’s after the Civil War, required that electoral districts be roughly equal in population. It held that if a state legislature created districts unequal in population, it denied its citizens “the equal protection of the law” guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.
In this week’s case, plaintiffs argued that Wisconsin denied them equal protection by drawing district lines that favored one political party over another. That, of course, is the purpose of gerrymandering, a practice as old as the Constitution, named after a notably aggressive partisan electoral district line drawer, Elbridge Gerry, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and signer of the Constitution.
 That gerrymandering is as old as our Republic doesn’t mean it is right or fair. It isn’t. But not every wrong can be effectively remedied by a U.S. Supreme Court decision, and the court was right to sidestep an issue that is properly a matter of legislative rather than judicial jurisdiction.
First of all, political parties are diverse and shifting coalitions, and any district line that may benefit one party at one time may end up disadvantaging the same party at another. Not to mention the fact that many districts’ populations are hardly static from one re-districting to the next.
Second, partisan political gerrymandering isn’t the only kind of gerrymandering going on. For example, County Board member districts are often drawn to advantage rural voters over city voters, or vice versa. ln states like Wisconsin, County Boards are elected on a non-partisan ballot but this doesn’t mean the votes of city and of country residents are equal in determining County Board representation.
Third, equal representation on the basis of one person-one vote rests on the accuracy of the census. But census tallies can wildly distort voter representation since they count every person in a particular area even if they do not — or cannot — vote.  Those under 18, for example, can’t vote yet they are counted, to the relative disadvantage of communities with few children, like Sun City, Ariz. Prisoners generally cannot vote but are counted by the census, giving greater weight to voters who live nearby. The same is true when it comes to counting those who are undocumented and resident non-citizens. Residents of college towns may benefit if the census includes students in the town population total who are not eligible to vote there.
Rather than attempting a court-based solution to gerrymandering that will inevitably spawn more grievances than it resolves, I vote to leave the search for the Holy Grail of electoral fairness to the messy but more democratic legislative process.

’s summit meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, it is useful to recall that despite periodic diplomatic breakthroughs between 1991 and 2007, which could have led to curtailing and rolling back Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, the net result was failure — leading to a rapid acceleration in North Korea’s capabilities during the past three years.
How could this have happened despite the best efforts of some very talented American diplomats and officials who were quite aware of the risks the U.S. faced?
For an answer, look no further than the various negative reactions amplified in U.S. media to the Trump-Kim meeting. These reactions reflect — and expand upon — the harsh criticisms leveled at U.S. diplomats and officials who negotiated with North Korea over the past three decades, criticisms that have helped to hobble effective American diplomacy. Notable examples:
 Trump loves dictators: “The evidence is now overwhelming that Trump cannot resist a dictator. … This was an unserious summit, cobbled together in haste by an unserious man.” (Roger Cohen, New York Times) 
Trump was played: “It sure looks as if President Trump was hoodwinked in Singapore.  Trump made a huge concession — the suspension of military exercises with South Korea. That’s on top of the broader concession of the summit meeting itself, security guarantees he gave North Korea and the legitimacy that the summit provides his counterpart, Kim Jong Un. In exchange for these concessions, Trump seems to have won astonishingly little.” (Nicholas Kristof, New York Times)
Trump intentionally undermined American national security: “For now, I’d only nominate [Trump] for the ‘Ignoble Prize.’ It’s given to the leader who uses his presidential prerogatives to undermine the personal security of his citizens and values of his nation in more ways in just one year than any leader before him.” (Thomas Friedman, New York Times)
 Anything less than a detailed denuclearization agreement represents failure: “The document is short on details. It is worrisome, very worrisome, that this joint statement is so imprecise.” (Sen. Chuck Schumer
(D-N.Y.), Senate minority leader)
Merely meeting the leader of North Korea resulted in a victory for Kim: “A summit is not an accomplishment for the American president. It is a major accomplishment for Kim Jong Un. In fact, the spectacle of seeing the American flags along with the [North Korean] flags as the backdrop for that handshake is … somewhat disgusting. It is actually a debasement of the American flag. This is a despotic regime that murders its own citizens.” (Jeremy Bash, former Department of Defense chief of staff)
The vehemence and all-knowing character of these and other negative reactions to the June 12 summit are striking — even more over-the-top than accusations of appeasement, perfidy, incompetence, bribery and disloyalty leveled in the past against U.S. officials who negotiated with North Korea.
Yet the recent reactions follow the same general pattern as those heard in previous years. North Korea is so negatively embedded in American political culture as our most reckless adversary that it takes a combination of presidential courage and deep skepticism about failed conventional approaches of the past to embark on a new path.
Like the decision by President Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger to chart a new diplomatic course toward Communist China, Trump’s decision was dictated by realpolitik. In the case of China, the U.S. administration wisely moved China away from Russia at the height of the Cold War against the Soviet Union. In the case of North Korea, the United States now has disrupted Pyongyang’s seemingly unstoppable drive to increase its arsenal of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles and has strengthened America’s long-term relations with the Korean people, both North and South.    
By introducing unprecedented security and economic incentives for denuclearization, on top of the toughest sanctions ever applied against Pyongyang, the Trump administration has maximized diplomatic leverage against Kim Jong Un. This approach advances the U.S. objective of achieving a diplomatic solution in the Korean Peninsula, where available military options would cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and could lead to a nuclear war.

It is also apt when mentally processing North Korea’s latest burst of apparent “free” concessions.
Kim Jong Un, the country’s chairman of the Korean Workers Party and the Central Military Commission, has been busy of late, standing down the two weapons systems that have unnerved the United States, South Korea and other countries for decades and walking away from other previously non-negotiable demands.
In recent days, North Korea’s supreme leader announced that his secretive and isolated nation no longer needed to test long-range missiles and nuclear weapons. What caused this transformation is less certain.
 President Trump
’s policies certainly played a role. But what of China’s part? And what of the inscrutable Chairman Kim’s conversion to prince of peace from despot of darkness?
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has been in a rapid thaw since before the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea this past February.
Just prior to the start of the winter games, the DPRK agreed to participate in the contests and even march together with South Korean athletes in the opening ceremony.
During the winter games, Pyongyang unveiled a charm offensive toward the Republic of Korea and the United States. After ROK officials visited the North, they flew to Washington carrying an invitation to Donald Trump for a meeting with Chairman Kim.
The president agreed to the meeting. Both sides have been gearing up to what will be the first summit between a sitting American president and ruler of North Korea.
The intervening period has seen a spate of head-spinning capitulations from Pyongyang. In mid-April, it eliminated a major hindrance to negotiations with Washington by dropping the demand that U.S. forces must be withdrawn from South Korea.
Therefore, America’s 28,500 troops will stay put while the DPRK opens discussions pertaining to its denuclearization, the aim of the Trump administration.
Even as American diplomats and analysts struggled to take in and absorb the North’s about-face decision on the garrisoning of U.S. military forces within South Korea, a duty dating from the 1950-1953 Korean War, the dictatorial regime released another bombshell.
Pyongyang startled the pre-North and South’s negotiating atmosphere by declaring that it was no longer going to test its nuclear arms or long-range missiles.
Halting the tests is certainly welcome and even propitious news for the upcoming meetings between first North Korea and the Republic of Korea at the end of this month and then the summit sometime in June with the United States.
Military officers in Japan and South Korea, however, were less than ecstatic because the DPRK said nothing about stopping launches of short- and medium-range rockets.
But the ROK’s liberal president, Moon Jae In, was too caught up in celebrating what seems to be a breakthrough for his long-cherished engagement posture toward the North, to get persnickety over the details of the flight ranges of missiles.
Little wonder that North Korean watchers are puzzled, circumspect and wary about the dramatic turnaround occurring north of the Demilitarized Zone, the armed border stretching between the ROK and the DPRK.
The Cold War, of which the standoff with Pyongyang is a distant but related sub-part, did manifest rare but sudden changes. For example, communist watchers of the early 1960s were also cautious about the ideological and political breakup between the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union.
Some commentators initially argued the split was fake, a means to fool the West into dropping its guard as the two communist giants appeared at daggers drawn. As evidence accumulated about the Sino-Soviet divergence, outsiders came to view it as inevitable.
Three decades afterward, Kremlin watchers looked in disbelieve as the Soviet Union slouched toward decline, demise and breakup.
The birth of democracy movements in Eastern Europe and the emergence of the 15 successor states in the defunct Soviet Union offered proof positive that the Soviet empire had fallen into the historical dustbin. The DPRK’s dramatic gestures strike a similar chord of shock.
What sparked this volt face? Certainly, the Trump’s hardball tactics of counter-threats, including rhetorical bomb throwing and deployment of warships and bombers to Korean waters, changed the cautious dynamics shown by former U.S. administrations.
But there might be deeper reasons that Chairman Kim is reversing the country’s militancy toward the United States and South Korea.
There is some speculation that the DPRK might turn the tables on China, its long-term material benefactor, because of Beijing’s pressure for change in Pyongyang’s domestic and international policies.
Time may tell about the rationale for Pyongyang’s announced step-backs from the brink of war. Or, the DPRK could easily revert to its former belligerency, as in past times.
Therefore, Washington confronts the extraordinary and tricky test of making permanent and verifiable Pyongyang’s apparent concessions. The Trump foreign policy team can agree to a genuine peace treaty to replace the armistice signed at the Korean War’s end.
It can normalize diplomatic relations with a disarmed DPRK. It can reassure the North that United States will not military strike at its bases. It could even provide some minimal financial assistance and mutual trade accords.
But what Trump cannot do is trust verifications of any promised denuclearization agreement to the United Nations or any third party. American inspections must be countrywide with no off-limit zones to intrusive U.S. inspectors.
Anything short of a total stoppage of nuclear-arming and missile-building will consign any deal to the too-good-to-be-true category.

The company offered no explanation as to why they are shutting their doors, but one can assume that they recognize the writing on the wall. The company is one of many that have made significant changes in the wake of mass carnage perpetrated with their merchandise or products similar to their own. In Slide Fire’s case, the product is infamous: the company manufactures bump stocks, the accessory used in the deadliest mass shooting in American history.
Bump stocks — accessories that allow semi-automatic guns to function as fully automatic weapons — garnered significant attention in October 2017. This was when a lone shooter in Las Vegas used them to kill 58 individuals and injure 851 — horrific numbers made possible by the accessory’s lethality. Bump stocks essentially subvert the federal ban on fully automatic firearms  by being manufactured and sold as a separate accessory.
Since the attack in Las Vegas, however, numerous policymakers have supported a bump stock ban, calling the modest, bipartisan legislation a commonsense step forward on gun violence prevention. Even Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), far from a gun violence prevention champion, recognized a need for a ban. Despite bipartisan support, however, federal bills to ban bump stocks lingered in committee. As has been the case after most mass shootings, Congress took no action.
 While blue states like Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington passed laws to ban the accessories, the bump stock debate soon died down. People moved on. It felt as though the moment had passed. It felt as though bump stocks — on the national level — were here to stay.
Then, 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Then, people took to the streets. Then, the gun violence prevention movement was energized like never before. Bump stocks played no role in the shooting, but that didn’t matter. From banning bump stocks to disarming abusers to reinstating the assault weapons ban, student activists in Florida and across the country put all gun violence prevention legislation on the table.
Watching them, elected officials from both parties recognized that they must take action — any action — on gun violence. Contrary to what gun violence prevention advocates expected, President Trump directed the Department of Justice to ban the accessories and hinted that if Congress passed a bill strengthening the ban, he would sign it.
The momentum continued. More states took legislative action. Bump stock bans passed in gun-friendly states like Florida and Vermont, and they continue to move forward in multiple states like Connecticut, Ohio, and Hawaii. The public and political appetite for a ban on these accessories is strong, and it’s unrelenting.
Companies are bowing to public pressure, changing their policies, and even closing their doors. States are changing their laws. Now is the time for Congress to act and create a national solution. Trump’s executive order, while a step in the right direction, is not enough; rather than leave a ban caught in the regulatory system and then the courts, Congress needs to do its job and legislate. Slide Fire Solutions’ closing is a harbinger of the positive changes still to come.
Banning bump stocks will not significantly reduce day-to-day gun violence; we must continue to pursue additional gun violence prevention policies. But a bump stock ban is a necessary step to deprive the next mass shooter of unnecessary killing power. There is no reason that Congress can not act now. We must demand that they do so.

In the House, the Democrats have history on their side. In the Senate, the Republicans have a map on their side.
With the exception of two midterm elections since World War II, every president with an approval rating below 50 percent has lost a double-digit number of seats in the House. The average loss is 22 seats. Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to retake the House. Gerrymandered districts will buck the historical trends, but past midterms are a good indication of what will likely happen this November. A president’s party gained seats in the House in only five midterm elections in American history.
At the end of his first year in office, President Trump
was the most unpopular president in modern presidential politics. His approval rating has hovered between 35 percent and 40 percent, and no president has had job approval ratings this low leading into the midterm elections. Presidents with those numbers have averaged a loss of 40 seats in the House. The latest polling average shows Trump’s popularity rising to 40 percent, his best number since the early weeks of his administration.
In 2010, President Obama had a 45 percent approval rating, and Democrats lost 63 seats. In 1994, President Clinton had a 46 percent approval rating, and Democrats lost 54 seats. These “wave elections” were devastating to the incumbent president’s party. The two exceptions in which a president’s party picked up seats in midterm elections occurred in 1998, when President Clinton enjoyed a 66 percent approval rating, and in 2002, when President Bush had a 63 percent approval rating.
Former Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-Texas) once said, “In politics, six months is a lifetime.” The election is still seven months away, and events can quickly change a president’s approval and the arithmetic. President Bush’s numbers soared to 90 percent after the attacks on 9/11. The day before, he had an approval rating of 51 percent.
In the Senate, Republicans will have a distinct advantage this November, regardless of the president’s popularity, because the Senate electoral map works in their favor. One-third of the Senate will stand for reelection, including 26 Democrats and two Independents who caucus with the Democrats. Three Republicans have announced they will not run for reelection, leaving their seats open.
To take back the majority, Democrats will need all their incumbents to win and pick up two Republican seats. While most contests in the Senate will not be competitive, the states that will be in play heavily favor the Republicans. Nearly all the Republicans up for reelection are in safe seats. There are 10 Democratic senators running in red states where Trump won. In five of those states, Trump won by double digits.
In spite of a favorable map, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.) has said cautiously, “This is going to be a challenging election year. We know the wind is going to be in our face.” There may be a wind blowing against Republicans in the Senate in November, but for Republicans in the House, it could be a hurricane.

The demonstration caps the most extraordinary season of gun control action in modern U.S. history.
But this new wave of activism will succeed only if movement leaders drive for change the way framers of the U.S. Constitution intended it to happen.
Founders intent
There’s much focus these days on protestors exercising First Amendment rights, and the Second Amendment gets a lot of play, too. But neither amendment ultimately dictates how change happens. It’s the 10th Amendment that points to which way the gun policy pendulum will swing next.
The 10th Amendment puts the majority of power with the people and state governments, rather than the president, Supreme Court or Congress. It gives support and shape to which changes happen in this country, and which ones do not.
It was specifically designed to prevent broad federal shifts from occurring abruptly, favoring democratic state-based action.
Today’s gun safety advocates can take a page from recent successful movements. The sweeping social changes made since the Civil Rights Era — from smoking cessation, drunk driving reduction and LGBT marriage equality to gun rights expansion — occurred because reformers first advocated at local and state levels.
Take LGBT marriage: Its proponents carefully mounted court cases, supported electoral campaigns, lobbied and shifted social norms in each U.S. state — while postponing federal action. So by the time the U.S. Supreme Court decided the landmark 2015 same-sex marriage case, support across most states had already been won.
A similar approach worked for tobacco control; funders poured more than $500 million into grassroots state coalitions supported nationally by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. And that same incremental approach has worked for the National Rifle Association (NRA).
Facing history
Memorializing Columbine’s shooting victims offers a sobering moment to reflect on what changes have happened over the last two decades, and what changes have not.
One thing that’s certainly shifted is the policy environment. The Columbine massacre was carried out under the 10-year federal Assault Weapons Ban enacted in 1994. While opposing sides debate the merits of such bans, what’s most noteworthy is the United States had a strong federal law.
Why was the federal assault weapons ban a political reality in the early 1990s, but not today? The reason lies in strong grassroots coalitions: Gun control groups had them at the time, and the NRA did not — yet.
Turning grassroots gold
When the Assault Weapons Ban and Brady Bill became law, the NRA had a very small and loosely-defined grassroots office. This soon transformed into a full-blown grassroots division, as the NRA formalized and built out member-facing programs — a shift that would prove key to subsequent legislative and electoral successes.
By ratcheting up its membership to nearly 5 million and channeling gun owners’ passions and concerns into electoral and legislative results in municipalities and states, the NRA turned its grassroots gold. 
Since Columbine, the NRA has leveraged its grassroots membership to systematically and deliberately advocate in a majority of U.S. states to defend and expand Second Amendment freedoms, such as passing preemption and open carry laws in the majority of states.
Ever wonder why there’s never has been a major gun rights march on the U.S. Capitol? Because Second Amendment proponents recognize how the framers intended for change to happen. That’s why after #NeverAgain’s March for Our Lives last month, gun rights advocates responded with rallies in multiple state capitols — not on the National Mall. 
After Columbine, leading gun control groups focused less on grassroots, but that’s recently changed. In the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting, Everytown for Gun Safety was established and has since galvanized more than 4 million supporters through chapters in every U.S. state.
By investing heavily in grassroots state-based campaigns, Everytown and their gun safety allies have blocked the NRA on multiple fronts — from stymying concealed carry reciprocity and preventing guns from being allowed on campuses and in most K-12 schools, to passing laws in 25 states and Washington D.C. to avert domestic abusers from owning guns.
For the first time in modern U.S. history, the gun control movement matches the NRA in volume, intensity and state-based action. And now #NeverAgain students are adding more fuel to the fire.
They’re also applying their civics lessons as well. When Florida’s #NeverAgain young leaders made their first move, they didn’t march on Washington. Instead they boarded buses for Tallahassee, convincing their governor to tighten gun laws.
Biden campaign announces first Texas hires for general election
Cuba spells trouble for Bass's VP hopes
The students didn’t win every demand, but their early success bodes well for gun reform in other states in the wake of the recent National School Walkout.
But the walk-outs won’t matter unless students now walk in to state legislatures, city councils, town hall meetings, and into voting booths in November. To prevent more gun violence, advocates young and old must recognize #10A while exercising their #1A rights, just as #2A proponents have done of late, if they want to win—which is just as the Framers intended.

0,04/21/18 10:00 AM EDT,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/384257-ethical-james-comey-under-investigation-for-unethical-acts,'Ethical' James Comey is under investigation for unethical acts,"One day after the disclosure that the Justice Department inspector general has recommended criminal charges against former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe
, it has been confirmed that fired FBI director James Comey
is under investigation by the same office for leaking information to the media. This disclosure followed the release of the Comey memos, which seriously undermined both Comey and his cadre of defenders. Four claims by Comey are now clearly refuted, and the memos reaffirm earlier allegations of serious misconduct.
James Comey was a leaker
For more than a year, various media experts have advanced dubious defenses for Comey, including the obvious problem that the man charged with investigating leaks became a leaker himself when as it suited him. Clearly, Comey removed the memos and did not allow for a predisclosure review of the material. Moreover, the memos were withheld by Comey’s surrogate, a Columbia University law professor, who reportedly read the information to the media.
If taking and disclosing memos were perfectly proper, why the surrogate and subterfuge? More importantly, Comey did not disclose the memos to Congress or hold copies for investigators. If Comey was not a leaker, then any fired FBI agent could do the same with nonpublic investigatory material. If the inspector general agreed with that position, then federal laws governing FBI material would become entirely discretionary and meaningless.
The memos were FBI material
Various media experts and journalists also defended Comey by portraying the memos as essentially diary entries. When I argued that the memos clearly were FBI material subject to limits on removal and disclosure, the response was disbelief. Legal expert and former FBI special agent Asha Rangappa said that these constituted “personal recollections,” and CNN legal expert and Brookings Institution fellow Susan Hennessey wrote, “It’s hard to even understand the argument for how Jim Comey’s memory about his conversation with the president qualifies as a record, even if he jotted it down while in his office.”
The plain fact, then and now, is that it’s hard to understand that it would be anything other than a record under federal rules. These were memos prepared on an FBI computer, in the course of an FBI investigation. All FBI agents sign a statement affirming that “all information acquired by me in connection with my official duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remain the property of the United States of America” and that an agent “will not reveal, by any means, any information or material from or related to FBI files or any other information acquired by virtue of my official employment to any unauthorized recipient without prior official written authorization by the FBI.”
The memos themselves now confirm their obvious status. These were not memos “to the file” or to Comey himself. He wrote them to the FBI as part of the investigation, specifically addressing the disclosures to McCabe, FBI general counsel James Baker and chief of staff James Rybicki. FBI director Christopher Wray has confirmed these were FBI documents. While Comey continues to maintain these were personal papers, it is demonstrably untrue on the face of the memos themselves.
There was no need to leak
In past columns, I have questioned Comey’s claim that he had to remove and leak the memos in the public interest. When Comey took the memos, he knew he was certain to be called before Congress within weeks. He simply could have told Congress about the memos, or even given copies to one of the intelligence committees. More importantly, he knew copies already were in the hands of other FBI officials and were certain to be reviewed by investigators.
Instead, Comey removed seven memos and gave four to his friend, Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman, to leak information to the media. If the memos already were in the hands of other FBI officials, including McCabe, then why leak them? It would not assist the investigation. To the contrary, by disclosing the information, Comey alerted President Trump
to the record of their conversations, making it less likely that Trump would contradict such a record.
Why? The reason is obvious: It benefitted Comey. He was able to control the media narrative after his firing and shifted the focus to Trump’s conduct rather than his own. The inspector general recently concluded McCabe leaked information for his personal interest, not that of the public. It’s difficult to envision how the inspector general could come to any other conclusion about Comey’s leak.
The memos were classified
The memos clearly reveal that Comey was aware they likely contained classified information. Comey wrote in a Jan. 7, 2017, memo that “I am unsure of the proper classification so I have chosen secret.” He then left it to his staff to correct that classification. As director, Comey had authority to determine what was classified, although he leaked the FBI documents after he was fired. It turns out that four memos, including two given to his friend to leak to the media, were later found to be classified.
So Comey was no longer director when he removed the memos from the FBI without review. He then gave four memos, including classified ones, to an uncleared individual specifically to leak to the media. Among other people prosecuted for such conduct, former FBI agent Terry Albury is now looking at a sentence of four to five years in prison in an unrelated case.
In his new book, Comey writes, “Ethical leaders choose a higher loyalty … over their own personal gain.” Yet, he opted for personal advantage in the leaking of his memos. He also rushed his book to print, even though the investigation he once headed is ongoing and he is a key witness. Even more remarkably, he never conferred with special counsel Robert Mueller
, if nothing else as a courtesy, and especially since Comey’s public references to both disclosed and undisclosed evidence is obviously not beneficial to that investigation.
Comey insists he wrote his book because he believes the country desperately needs “ethical leadership” — his, apparently — and that ethical leaders “don’t hide from uncomfortable questions.” If true, Comey will be a busy man when the inspector general comes calling.

Many traditional civil libertarians have allowed their strong anti-Trump sentiments to erase their long-standing commitment to neutral civil liberties. They are so desperate to get President Trump
that they are prepared to compromise the most basic due process rights. They forget the lesson of history that such compromises made against one’s enemies are often used as precedents against one’s friends.
In the play and movie, “A Man for all Seasons,” Robert Bolt wrote, “When the last law was down, and the devil turned round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country’s planted thick with laws from coast to coast — man’s laws, not God’s — and if you cut them down, and you’re just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I’d give the devil benefit of law, for my own safety’s sake.”
Today, fair-weather civil libertarians are unwilling to give President Trump, who they regard as the devil, the “benefit of law” and civil liberties. Consider the issue of criticizing special counsel Robert Mueller
. Any criticism or even skepticism regarding Mueller’s history is seen as motivated by a desire to help Trump.
Mueller was an assistant U.S. attorney in Boston, the head of its criminal division, then head of the criminal division at the main Justice Department and the FBI director during the most scandalous miscarriage of justice in the FBI’s modern history. Four people were framed by the FBI in order to protect murderous gangsters working as FBI informers. An FBI agent, who is now in prison, was tipping off crime boss Whitey Bulger as to who might testify against him so that those individuals could be killed.
Those tips later enabled Bulger to escape and remain on the lam for 16 years. What responsibility, if any, did Mueller — who was in key positions of authority and capable of preventing these horrible miscarriages — have in this sordid incident? No less a legal figure than Judge Mark Wolf, a former prosecutor who conducted extensive hearings about this entire mess, made the following findings.
“The files relating to the Wheeler murder, and the FBI’s handling of them, exemplify recurring irregularities with regard to the preparation, maintenance, and production in this case of documents damaging to [Stephen] Flemmi and Bulger. First, there appears to be a pattern of false statements placed in Flemmi’s informant file to divert attention from his possible crimes and/or FBI misconduct…”
“Second, contrary to the FBI’s usual policy and practice, all but one of the reports containing … allegations against Bulger and Flemmi were not indexed and placed in an investigative file referencing their names. Thus, those documents were not discoverable by a standard search of the FBI’s indices … Third, when documents damaging to the FBI were found by the Bureau, they were in some instances not produced to the defendants or the court at the time required by the court’s orders…”
Judge Wolf also referenced what Mueller may have known of two murders Bulger committed while acting as an FBI informer, writing, “The source also claimed to have information that Bulger and Pat Nee had murdered Halloran and Bucky Barrett. The source subsequently said that there was an eyewitness to the Halloran shooting who might come forward, and elaborated, ‘There is a person named John, who claims he talked to Whitey and Nee as they sat in the car waiting for Halloran on Northern Avenue. He sits in a bar and talks about it. He saw the whole operation.’”
He continued, “The source added that the person providing the information to the source ‘will be willing to talk to you soon.’ On Feb. 3, 1988, Weld directed Keeney to have the information that he had received sent to the United States attorney in Boston, Frank McNamara, and to the strike force chief, Jeremiah O’Sullivan. Weld added, ‘Both O'Sullivan and Bob Mueller are well aware of the history, and the information sounds good.’” Mueller at this time was assistant U.S. attorney in Boston.
It is widely believed among Boston law enforcement observers that the FBI was not really looking for Bulger during the years that Mueller was its director and that the FBI was fearful about what Bulger would disclose about his relationship with agents over the years. It took a U.S. Marshals officer to find Bulger, who was hiding in plain view in California.
Much of this and other details surrounding the scandal have been reported by Fox News and in other media accounts. Recently, Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge and civil libertarian, rushed to Mueller’s defense in a New York Times opinion column, declaring “without equivocation” that Mueller  had “no involvement” in the massive miscarriage of justice. Her evidence is the lack of evidence in the files.
Yet, no civil libertarian should place such great trust in government files, especially in light of Judge Wolf’s findings. They should join my call for an objective investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector general before they assure the public “without equivocation” that Mueller had absolutely “no involvement.”
But the “get Trump at any cost” partisans have rejected my call for an investigation, out of fear that it may turn up information that might tarnish the image of the special counsel who is investigating Trump. Instead they criticize those of us who point out that Mueller was “at the center” of the Justice Department and FBI when this miscarriage of justice occurred.
All civil libertarians should want the truth about this sordid episode — and Mueller’s possible role — regardless of its impact, if any, on the Trump investigation. Mueller, too, should welcome an objective investigation, which might eliminate any question about his role in this travesty. Yet, as I have written previously, for too many former civil libertarians the hope of getting Trump trumps civil liberties.
It is ironic to see many right-wingers criticizing overreach by law enforcement, while many left-wingers now defend such overreaching. Hypocrisy and selective outrage abounds, as neutral principles take a back seat. Conservatives used to say “a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged.” I would respond that “a liberal is a conservative who is being audited or whose kid was busted for pot.”
Today, a civil libertarian is a conservative whose candidate is being investigated, while a “law and order” type is a liberal who wants to see Trump charged or impeached. I am a liberal who voted against Trump but who insists that his civil liberties must be respected, for all of our sakes.

Jim Jordan
(R-Ohio) is the only choice for House Speaker.
When it comes to the obvious qualifiers, Jordan checks all the boxes: good seniority, affable personality, well-liked by his colleagues. But he also maintains a quality noticeably missing from the other top contenders for Speakership: credibility.
Unlike current Republican leadership, Rep. Jordan has earned the trust of his peers (and the GOP base at-large) with his proven commitment to cut spending and change the status quo in Washington.
You can bet a House with Speaker Jordan at the gavel will not be rushing $1.3 trillion spending bills through Congress without giving lawmakers a chance to read the legislation. It also won’t be taking show votes on balanced budget amendments right after sending the federal government toward trillion-dollar deficits as early as 2020.
Grassroots America genuinely believe a Speaker Jim Jordan would make Congress work again — not because of his words, but because of his actions. That’s why thousands of FreedomWorks activists nationwide launched a campaign this week to draft Rep. Jordan into the Speakership race.
Return the House to Regular Order
The only way to help President Trump
""drain the swamp"" is to fundamentally change the way Congress operates. This starts with the Speaker of the House. Unlike the partisan positions of majority leader and majority whip, the Speakership is a constitutional office.
It is the responsibility of the Speaker to make sure all 12 appropriations bills are passed separately, and to preserve an open amendment process on legislation. The Speaker also takes charge of the House Rules Committee, where the GOP legislative agenda of spending cuts, entitlement reform, and health care reform will live or die based on his/her commitment to giving these issues a vote.
This Speakership race will draw a line in the sand, forcing Republican incumbents to put their commitment to an open legislative process on the record. A vote for Jim Jordan will be a vote for increased transparency in Congress, and a return to regular order. A vote for Rep. Kevin McCarthy
(R-Calif.), by contrast, will be a vote for more of the same.
Trust of Fiscal Conservatives 
Jim Jordan is the only name that received unanimous consent from our FreedomWorks Activist Advisory Council, a coalition of top grassroots leaders from across the country. In less than 24 hours, fiscal conservatives have taken more than 8,000 grassroots actions to contact their representatives and voice support for a Jordan Speakership campaign on social media, using the hashtag #SpeakerJordan.
The level of grassroots energy surrounding Rep. Jordan is something FreedomWorks hasn’t seen in years. Republican incumbents should take this excitement as a strong indicator that selecting a fiscally conservative House Speaker would change the entire momentum of the 2018 midterm election cycle.
Preparing Republicans for the 2018 Election
The fiscally conservative base of the GOP has long understood the swamp is bipartisan. They know that to pass good policy, sometimes you must beat the Republicans before you can beat the Democrats. That’s why the House Freedom Caucus has roughly three-dozen members and continues to quietly grow with every election cycle.

— The Hill (@thehill) April 18, 2018
This speakership election is a battle for the soul of the Republican Party, and it will have a profound effect on Republican midterm election turnout. Past election cycles have proven that when Republicans act like Democrats, Republicans stay home. When they act like fiscal conservatives, Republican voters show up at the ballot box in droves.
A Jim Jordan Speakership would be an act of good faith to the fiscally conservative base of the GOP that the Republican majority is finally ready to start keeping their promises.
The path to victory for a true conservative to become House leadership is a challenge. It will require the American people to get engaged in the process and create an environment that forces Congress to do the right thing. It’s happened before, and it can happen again.
This is why FreedomWorks is committing its full institutional support behind Rep. Jim Jordan. If you believe in free markets and a functioning government, you should too.

is being investigated as a possible “back channel” to Russia.
At a hearing, federal prosecutors defended special counsel Robert Mueller
’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election, arguing that Mueller did not exceed his authority by indicting Manafort on charges related to his pre-campaign work.
ADVERTISEMENT
Michael Dreeben, an attorney for the Justice Department, told U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson that part of Mueller’s probe into Manafort is investigating whether the former campaign chair provided “back channels” to Russia, according to Bloomberg.
“He had long-standing ties to Russia-backed politicians,” Dreeben said. “Did they provide back channels to Russia? Investigators will naturally look at those things.”
Prosecutors said earlier this month in a court filing that Mueller’s investigation, by nature of investigating connections between the Trump campaign and Russia, would “naturally cover ties that a former Trump campaign manager had to Russian-associated political operatives, Russian-backed politicians, and Russian oligarchs.”
Manafort is charged on several counts, including money laundering, tax fraud and other financial crimes, related to his and his associate Richard Gates’s lobbying work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine. Gates has pleaded guilty to two counts and is cooperating with the investigation.
The Justice Department reportedly authorized Mueller to investigate allegations of collusion between Manafort and the Russian government.
Earlier this month, Manafort filed a civil lawsuit attempting to limit the scope of Mueller’s probe, arguing that the special counsel overstepped his boundaries by investigating allegations that arose before his time on the Trump campaign.
Mueller has indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities on charges related to alleged meddling in the presidential election."

For several months and as some high-profile special election wins reinforced, the Democratic Party is itching to claim a beautiful, “blue wave” of Dem wins in November.
Many believe Democrats are well-positioned to take back the House and perhaps make impressive gains in the Senate as the voters continue to reject the style and substance of “Trumpublican” rule.
It may be premature, however, for Democrats to plan victory celebrations or to claim voters will prefer their brand. It is precisely because the Democrats now seem intent on tweaking their message and their brand to reflect the policy positions and polling specific to individual races. There is a very real risk of further diluting what the Democratic brand means to voters as a distinct alternative to Trump’s not-so-Grand-Old-Party.
 While we have several months to go before the midterms, Democrats are signing up and queuing up in droves to run for office. Primary battles pit “Berniecrats” against “Hillarybots.” The 2016 Dem presidential primary battle created fault lines in the Democratic Party that are still being negotiated today.
In some areas, “establishment or corporate” Dems are pitted against the “hard left” or more progressive wing ignited during the run up to the 2016 general election. While the party has done a lot of work to bridge the divide, some Democrats worry that the leftward pull the Sanders’ campaign exerted will be subverted by the desire to win as many seats as possible in 2018 and to do so by matching candidates and their positions to the views held most widely in their districts and states.
We have already seen Democratic candidates who support a wide range of positions of gun control and safety, health care, climate issues and immigration.
An overall party platform would be difficult to pin down and the usual pressures about why some candidates are preferred by the “D-Triple-C” (as the party in-crowd labels the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee or DCCC) have been magnified by the increasingly pliable core issues around what it means now to be a Democrat — what values do we hold together as Democrats?
Is there one party platform to which we all aspire? If our candidates are encouraged most strongly to reflect and react to conditions within their own races and to tweak their stands to match perceived voter trends, we are at real risk of losing the collective values of inclusion and fighting for the working class that drove Democrats to be Democrats.
This also encouraged voters to trust that voting for a Democrat meant voting for certain values. As we allow the softening around long-held policy positions in order to win individual races, we risk eroding the power of our collective voice to confront the threat that we are in the end stages of the American democratic experiment.
While it is true that a conservative-leaning area of one of the southern states certainly requires a different sort of candidate and campaign than a liberal leaning in the northeast or the west, that cannot and must not mean that policy positions or core values are morphed. Messaging can be tweaked; positions and values cannot.
Being a Democrat must still stand for something more than not being a Trumpublican or a Green or a Libertarian. If those elected in 2018 are all over the map in terms of their positions and values on critical issues, the dysfunction in Congress and beyond will be even more pronounced.
Being a Democrat need not mean one homogenous set of issue positions, but if we want to break the cycle in which a huge percentage of voters see all politicians as basically cut from the same cloth, we Democrats have some serious soul-searching to do.
Painful as it might be to do that now, if the current plan helps candidates win by measuring only winnability as the criteria for races will ultimately crush longer term success — and perhaps even damage the Democratic Party forever.
Tweaking the messaging is vastly different from tweaking the candidate. If Democrats are not able to hold firm positions and use their knowledge and research around policies that advance those positions to message appropriately, then Democrats do not really stand for much.
Democratic candidates who embrace the party platform and positions will be able to win and be part of a “blue wave” if those candidates articulate their positions intelligently and honestly.
Voters will not show up just to dump Trump and his ilk, but voters will show up if and when they hear candidates stand for them in tangible ways that make their American lives better — less difficult and less stressed by warring political scandals that highlight the vast divide between how the wealthy and powerful behave and how most of the rest of us live.
Becoming more decent and more ready to protect those things that make more people have the opportunities to live fulfilling lives is a powerful balm for voters. There is always a way to message common sense and human decency — always.
So what is the threat from within the Dem Party? It has been a house divided against itself for long enough, friends. The nation is at serious risk and Democrats can either throw down with the power mongers or stand up for and with their base  and right now, I see a lot of exclusion not inclusion. Dems need to clear away the words all those consultants are selling them for many millions of dollars.
Democrats need to be solid, positive and clear about what they believe and how hard they are willing to fight to achieve progress. Part of the core problem is and always has been the divide between words and actions — voters are inspired when given someone or something inspiring to support.
I am a Democrat for now. I say for now because I am worried and conflicted. As an aging. White woman with health problems, I am not exactly of much value to most of the Democratic power-brokers I know.
It used to be that I would have trusted that Democrats would be more attentive to disability issues, seniors, economic justice, health care, poverty, education and healthy communities. These issues were why I became a Democrat. What scares me most about Trump and his buddies is the damage being done in all of those policy areas.
What I want to see most is how Democrats will respond to these damages now and going forward. Our world has changed. How will Democrats be my voice in this mess if they do not hear or see me? In reality — not in some dreamland where money and status have no say. Democrats, give us your vision, your passion and most of all clarity to make things better and that Blue Wave will happen in November. But if you keep trying to ignore the base Democratic mission and if you keep trying to move more towards conservatism, get ready for another disappointing midterm performance. Don’t be Republican-lite, be power-filled Democrats.
Donna S. Smith is the executive director of Progressive Democrats of America."
